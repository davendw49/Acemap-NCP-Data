The critical and urgent need at thismoment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to preventthese thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. It has beenrecently known that 2019-nCoV shares a common cellular mechanism with thesevere acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Thus, wesurveyed a previous retrospective case study on SARS which showed that acuterenal impairment was uncommon in SARS but carried a formidably high mortality(91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). Here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functionsin 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renalimpairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level ofplasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. The computerized tomography(CT) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) ofthe patients. Together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea thatrenal impairment is common in 2019-nCov patients, which may be one of themajor causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute tomultiorgan failure and death eventually. Therefore, we strongly suggest exercising ahigh degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-nCoV patientsand, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuousrenal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney functions as early aspossible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventingfatality.A recent seminal work by the lab of Dr. Shi1 provided strong evidence that the2019-nCoV uses the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II) as a cell entryreceptor, a cellular mechanism identical to that of the SARS-CoV 2,3. Moreover, again-of-function experiment reported in 20154 verified that the ACE2 could beindeed used by a wildtype coronavirus of a bat origin. However, ACE2 is notexclusively expressed in the respiratory organs. Previous reports on the ACE2expressing level in human tissues using RNA-seq method (Fig. 1) showed that theACE2 expression in gastrointestinal organs (small intestine, duodenum) or urinaryorgans (kidney) was much higher (nearly 100-fold) than that in respiratory organs(lung). This result suggests that the kidney is a possible target that can be infectedby either SARS-CoV or 2019-nCoV. On the other hand, according to the clinicalcase data, a detailed retrospective study of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak5 foundthat acute renal impairment was uncommon in SARS but carried a formidably highmortality (91.7%, 33 of 36).Data adapted from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=59272Note a recent fact that the reported infectious cases in the ongoing2019nCoV outbreak (31774, until 24:00 of Feb. 7th 2020, obtained from the ChineseNational Health Commission) already much greatly outnumbered the overallreported cases in the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak (8098). Strikingly, the situation iskeeping highly serious because of a large number of severe inpatients (~19%,6101 of 31774). Therefore, any promising strategies to prevent these patientsfrom worsening and dying shall be urgently developed. And in turn, the entiresociety will benefit from relieving the stress caused by fear of death.For this retrospective study, we randomly recruited 59 patients from Jan. 21st toFeb. 7th, 2020 at Tongji Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital in Wuhan,Huangshi Central Hospital in Huangshi, and Southwest Hospital in Chongqing,China. According to the arrangements conducted by the Chinese Government,adult patients (aged > 18 years) were admitted to the hospitals without selectivity.All patients who were enrolled in this study were diagnosed as infected by2019nCoV pneumonia according to the guidance provided by the China\u2019s NationalHealth Commission. This study was approved by the Ethics Commissions of TongjiHospital, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Huangshi Central Hospital and SouthwestHospital.We analyzed 59 cases of 2019-nCoV inpatients from multiple hospitals in Wuhanas well as in another nearby outbreak city Huangshi, and also from Chongqing(~900 km away from Wuhan, 426 infected cases reported until 24:00 of February7th 2020). We focused our analysis on some key function indicators of the kidney,including urine protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), plasma creatinine (Cre), andrenal CT scan data.These 59 patients (34 males and 25 females, in the age of 28 to 83, medianage of 52) included 28 that were diagnosed as \u2018severe\u2019 cases according to theguidance issued by the China\u2019s National Health Commission, and 3 deceased cases(their ages were 66, 62 and 48 respectively). Demographic and symptom profileswere obtained in all patients on admission. The statistical analyses showed thatthe blood urea nitrogen (BUN) had a significant difference between the group ofsevere cases and the group of the rest (***p<0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test),while both the urine protein and plasma creatinine had no significant differencebetween the groups.The test of urine protein was collected from 51 patients (Fig. 2a) andproteinuria was found in 32/51 (63%) patients. The semiquantitative resultshowed (+) in 24 patients (47%), (++) in 5 patients (10%), and (+++) in 3 patients(6%) (Fig. 2b). Note that among these patients with proteinuria (32 cases), a largenumber (64%) was found to have the detected urine protein on the first day ofadmission, suggesting the presence of renal impairment already before or at themoment of admission, offering a potential time point for starting interventions toprotect kidney functions.a, Level values for all patients tested with respect to urine protein. Red circles correspond toproteinuria. b, Percentages of patients tested (n = 51). Note that 0 represents (-), and 1, 2, 3represent (+), (++) and (+++) respectively.2. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 16/59 (27%) patients exhibited an elevated levelof BUNIn the patients with increased BUN levels (16/59 cases), the peak plasma BUNlevels ranged from -0.46 to 7.40 of the normalized value, with a median value of0.32 of the normalized value (normal value before normalization: 1.7-12.8mmol/L; Fig. 3a, b). In 23 cases, we were able to collect the data for the change inBUN levels over days (Fig. 3c), and this result showed that 43% (10/23) of thesepatients underwent an increase in BUN and the duration from the onset ofadmission to the presence of the BUN increase was in the range of 2 to 10 days(median 4). Note that the 2/3 deceased patients had rather high levels of BUNbefore death (peak values: 23.61 and 32.09 mmol/L respectively; pointed out bythe last two arrows in Fig. 3c).a, Values for all patients tested with respect to BUN.

The color-coded triangles correspond to theBUN values of different days. The red arrows indicate the deceased cases. Note that the dottedlines indicate the normal level that has been normalized to 1.3. Plasma creatinine (Cre): 11/59 (19%) patients exhibited an elevated level ofCre and 3 deaths had an extremely high level.In the patients with increased Cre levels (11/59 cases), we found the peakplasma Cre levels ranged from -1.23 to 5.97 of the normalized value (median 0.42;normal value before normalization: 40-115 \u03bcmol/L) (Fig. 4a, b). In 23 cases, wecould monitor the change in Cre levels over days (Fig. 4c). We found that theduration from the onset of admission to the presence of the Cre increase was inthe range of 1 to 10 days (median 5). Note that rather high levels of Cre beforedeath in all 3 deceased patients (peak values: 209, 280 and 286 \u03bcmol/Lrespectively; pointed out by red arrows in Fig. 4c), supporting the Cre level as arisk factors predicting mortality in coronavirus-infected patients5.a, Values for all patients tested with respect to Cre.

CT data: all 27/27 patients exhibited radiographic abnormalities of thekidneys.In 27 patients, we were able to collect the plain CT scan results of theparenchyma of the kidneys in addition to the chest CT scan. 14 of these 27patients exhibited proteinuria, 3 had an increased level of creatinine and 4 had anincreased level of BUN. The CT value of the renal parenchyma was measured onthe image of the largest layer of the kidney6,7. We found that the CT value ofbilateral renal parenchyma was in the range of 19.5-34.97, with a median of 26.67,which was significantly lower than patients without kidney disease (35 HU) in ourhospital (***p <0.001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). It was also smaller than the resultof the previous study (normal kidney CT value of 38 HU)8 (see the example of twopatients in Figure 5a and b). 27/27 patients had a smaller value than 35HU (Fig.5c). The results indicate that inflammation and edema of the renal parenchymamay occur in 2019-nCoV infected patients.a and b, CT examples of two different patients (71-year old male and 70-year old male),respectively. The left column is the lung window images of the plan chest CT scan, and themiddle column is the mediastinal window images. Multiple lung segments with patchy,segmental density and slightly higher and uniform ground-glass shadows (GGO) were observed.Right column, CT images of the largest layer of kidney and CT values of bilateral kidney. c,Average CT values for all patients (n = 27). Red plusses correspond to the levels of CT values.Note that the dotted lines indicate the normal level.The high degree of similarity in cellular mechanism of the 2019-nCoV and theSARS-CoV suggests that the risk factors of mortality could also be similar. In theprevious SARS-CoV case study5, acute renal impairment was the top risk factor ofmortality (16.91 (8.368\u201334.16)), even significantly higher than acute respiratorydistress 10.28 (4.854\u201321.77). In that case study, all patients who eventually died(N = 33) had a progressive rise of plasma creatinine, and the rise of plasmacreatinine was rapid in those who succumbed early in their illness. In our results,three deceased cases also showed very high levels of creatinine before death.Compared to the 2003 SARS patients that had only a small fraction (6.7%)of cases with acute renal impairment, we found that, in the patient group that westudied, a remarkably increased number (63%, 32/51) of 2019-nCoV casesexhibited proteinuria (Fig. 2), indicative of renal impairment. In support of renalimpairment, we observed an increased level of BUN (Fig. 3) and Cre (Fig. 4) in asubstantial fraction of patients. In addition, the CT scan data of the kidneyssuggested inflammation and edema occurring in the parenchyma in all casestested (Fig. 5). The renal impairment could be caused by 2019-nCoV entering thecells through ACE2 that are highly expressed in the kidney (Fig. 1).Therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution inmonitoring the kidney functions of 2019-nCoV severe patients regardless of thepast disease history. Upon day-by-day monitoring and analysis, earlyinterventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT)9 shall beapplied as soon as possible to protect kidney functions, particularly for thosepatients with Cre level monotonically rising. This suggestion of therapy strategy isbased on the following rationales:1. Any interventions (particularly including CRRT in combination withimmunoadsorption procedure) to protect kidney functions are recommended to beapplied to the severe patients with 2019-nCov as early as possible afteradmission, due to the observation of proteinuria on the first day of admissionin a large number of cases.2. CRRT has been reported to be an effective treatment in a few cases on severepatients of respiratory diseases including the middle east respiratorysyndrome (MERS)10.3. CRRT is generally beneficial with a low risk to 2019-nCoV infected patients thatalready developed severe symptoms. The beneficial effects include e.g.,removing inflammatory cytokines11.4. CRRT devices and expert users are readily available in large numbers in manyhospitals. Approved protocols are well-established and operation costs aremuch less than that of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices.We greatly appreciate all the people, particularly thousands of clinicians, nursesand scientists including Dr. Li Wenliang, who are heroically battling to eradicatethis disaster for days and nights.
