Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April.

We assume that recovered individuals have immunityat least during this epidemic period. Let N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + A(t) + R(t) bethe total number of individuals in the free community. In order to fit the data, weexplicitly generated additional two groups, i.e. the cumulative number of recoveredRh(t) and dead cases D(t) from hospital . The total number of cumulative reportedcases is set to be T (t). All the state variables are summarized in Table 1.\u27e8 Table 1 is near here \u27e9Due to the travel restriction, migrations from/to Hubei province and other regionsare ignored. Birth and nature death are also neglected.          With the increasing of cumulative number of confirmed cases, theprobability of contact transmission among the informed susceptible populations wouldcertainly reduce ([                    Page 4 of 10decreasing with T (t), so as to well reflect the impact of media coverage on people\u2019spsychology and behaviors. c(t) = c0 for T = 0 and lim c(T ) = 0. It should bemenT !1tioned that the contact function c(t) in [          By body temperature measurements everywhere and diagnoses in hospitals,symptomatic infectious individuals can be detected. The detection rate is assumed to beq2I(t). Infected individuals in Q class can be confirmed at the rate of \u03b7Q(t) bynucleic acid testing. Additionally, close contact tracing followed by quarantine andisolation is a critical control measure. We assume that, once a case is confirmed,q3 individuals would be traced. Therefore, q3(q2I(t) + \u03b7Q(t)) individuals would betraced in a unit time, which is dependent on the number of new confirmed casesq2I(t) + \u03b7Q(t). We also assume that, among these traced individuals, NS fractionparts are susceptible, NE fraction parts are exposed, NI fraction parts are infectiouswith symptoms and NA fraction parts are infectious but asymptomatic. NR fractionparts are recovered, which are not needed to be isolated and are still in the R class.The disease transmission flow chart is depicted in Figure 1 and other parametersare summarized in Table 2. Based on the above assumptions, we formulate thefollowing model to describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>8 dddddSEASddIddditt(((((tttttttt))))) ===== (q\u03b8\u03b213\u03d5c\u03b2((Eqct2)(\u03b8I(t)I)+(\u03d5\u03b3+IEI\u03b7I+\u03beQA\u03be))A\u03b3NdSNAS)IANS \u00b5q\u03d52SEIi,< dQ(t) = q3(q2I + \u03b7Q) E + I + A> dt N>>>>>>>> dHdt(t) = q2I + \u03b7Q dH \u03b3H H,>>>>>>> dRd(tt) = \u03b3I I + \u03b3AA + \u03b3H H,>>>>>>>> dRdht(t) = \u03b3H H,>>>>>:>>>>>> ddDTddt((ttt)) == qd2HI.+ \u03b7Q.q3(q2I + \u03b7Q) NS + \u00b5Si,q3(q2I + \u03b7Q) NE ,q3(q2I + \u03b7Q) NI ,q3(q2I + \u03b7Q) NA ,\u03b7Q,(1)\u27e8 Figure 1 is near here \u27e9          According to the concept of next generation matrix in [          Page 5 of 10Rc =\u03b2\u03b8c0\u03b3I + d + q2+ \u03b2\u03be(1 \u2212 \u03b8)c0 .\u03b3A          The basic reproduction number is the average number of secondary infectionsdue to an infective during the infectious period when everyone else in thepopulation is susceptible [          Re(t) =\u03b2\u03b8c0e T (t)\u03b3I + d + q2+ \u03b2\u03be(1 \u2212 \u03b8)c0e\u03b3AT (t)as the effective daily reproduction ratio, the average number of new infectionsinduced by a single infected individual during the infectious period at time t.\u27e8 Table 2 is near here \u27e9          COVID-19 data excluding Hubei province were archived from NHCC from January20th (the first day that the number of confirmed cases was reported) to February27th, 2020, as shown in Figure 2 ([          We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with an adaptiveMetropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to fit the model. The algorithm is run for110,000 iterations with a burn-in of the first 80,000 iterations, and the Gewekeconvergence diagnostic method is employed to assess convergence of chains. At thesignificance level of 5%(the critical value of z is 1.96), all parameters and initialvalues estimated do not reject the original hypothesis of convergence to a posteriordistribution (Figure 3).\u27e8 Figure 2 is near here \u27e9          The population of mainland China excluding Hubei province is around 1,336,210,000[          \u27e8 Figure 3 is near here \u27e9Page 6 of 10Figure 4 (a) and (b) show that our model yields a good visual fit to the epidemiccurves. The MCMC estimation results of each parameters and initial values of somestate variables are given in Table 1 and Table 2. By fitting the data, we estimatedthe control reproduction number to be 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64).Using the estimated parameter values and the number of cumulative cases T (t),the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t) can be calculated (Figure 5). The resultdemonstrates that Re(t) has dropped sharply from 3.34 (Re(1) = 3.34) on January20th to 0.89 (Re(12) = 0.89, less than 1) on January 31st, 2020, which implies thatthe integrated control strategies implemented in mainland China excluding Hubeihas successfully reduced transmission intensity and prevented the epidemic growthin a short time frame.\u27e8 Figure 4 is near here \u27e9Under the current rigorous integrated control and self-protection measures, thetime series of T (t) depicted in Figure 4 (a) shows that the cumulative number ofconfirmed cases will continue growing slowly for some duration and tend to itspredicted maximum, which is 13155. Besides, although the number of hospitalizedindividuals has peaked on around February 12th, 2020, but it will not shrink to zeroin the near future (Figure 4 (c)). Obviously, new infections would occur as long asthe infectious individuals who have not been detected exist once people start relieveself-isolation and protection. It is the number of undetected infectious individualsthat determines when people\u2019s lives are able to return back to normal. Hence weshould closely follow the total number of I(t) and R(t). Figure 4 (d) displays thatthe number of infectious individuals has been decreasing gradually since the end ofJanuary. However, it will not descent down to 1 until late March, which infers thatpeople should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep personalprotect before April.\u27e8 Figure 5 is near here \u27e9Using the estimated parameter values and the expression of the effectivereproduction ratio Re(t), the threshold value of the intervention coefficient with respectto contact, q1, can be calculated, which is 0.3. This implies that in order to blockthe continuous spread of the virus, the value of q1 must be less than 0.3 to guaranteeRe(t) is below 1. In other words, the contact rate should be kept below 30% of thenormal level.To examine the impact of partial lifting control measures on disease transmission,we plot the predicted time series of the number of cumulative confirmed cases, T (t),and the number of the infectious individuals, I(t)+A(t), with different contact rates(Figure 6). Assuming that the adjusting time is from March 5th, 2020, Figure 6 (a)and (b) illustrate that contact rate with 20% of the initial value c0 will not causethe disease re-bounce. However, the epidemic period will be extended for about 40days until early May and the cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase byaround 0.5% to 13227. While if the starting time of the adjusting is postponed toMarch 20th, the epidemic time of disease will be extended for about one week andthe cumulative number of confirmed cases will increase by only around 0.05% to13161, compared with the scenario of no changes. Nevertheless, if the contact rateis half of the initial value, i.e. q1 = 0.5 and Re(t) = 1.68, COVID-19 will re-bouncePage 7 of 10on a large scale in a short time frame, even if the starting time is postponed toMarch 20th.\u27e8 Figure 6 is near here \u27e9In this paper, we proposed a novel COVID-19 transmission model incorporating theintervention measures implemented in China. Particularly, we adopted two novelfunction forms which dynamically captured the real-time endemic situation. Thefirst one is the contact rate, c(t), which was assumed to be dependent on thecumulative number of confirmed cases to better quantify the varied interventions andself-protection measures. The other one is the contact tracing rate, which wasdependent on the number of new cases.We evaluated the impact of partial lifting control measures on COVID-19transmission. Our results show that relieve self-protection too early may lead to thespread of the virus for a longer time and more people would be infected, and mayeven lead to the mass transmission of the virus again. The reduction of theemergency response level does not mean that people can be off guard. At least until theend of March, life will not be able to return to normal.In the process of recovery of production and life, we should pay attention totake protective measures to minimize the contact between people, such as wearingmasks and trying to avoid crowded places to cut the risk of catching coronavirus.By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we assert that people\u2019s contact rateshould be kept below 30% of the normal level and the lower the better.The forecasts presented are based on the assumption that there are no importedcases from Hubei and other infected regions. The WHO recently upgraded the globalrisk of the epidemic to \u2019very high\u2019. New endemic foci outside China are formed, suchas South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, etc. Although the current endemic situation inChina is under control, population migration cross country border should be takeninto consideration when we modify the updated controlling policy of COVID-19.With the development of the epidemic situation in other countries in the world, itis very important to maintain and strengthen the quarantine of entry personnel. Theimpact of international mobility on the transmission of COVID-19 will be studiedin our future works.We concentrated on the epidemic situation in mainland China excluding Hubeiprovince is due to the significant differences between Wuhan, Hubei, and the rest ofthe country. In Wuhan, Hubei, the origin of the new emerging disease COVID-19, ittook much longer time to recognize and understand the disease transmission thanother regions. It requires certain time from unknown to known. Therefore, the dataaccuracy in Wuhan, Hubei is a major issue for parameters\u2019 calibration. In addition,the sudden large outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei exhausted all medical resources in ashort time. A more targeted model considering medical resource capacity will beanticipated in the future.In conclusion, to ensure the COVID-19 epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary tomaintain the current integrated control intervention and self-protection measures,Page 8 of 10including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed byquarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People shouldbe fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personalprotection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected tobe ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province.COVID-19: Corona Virus Disease 2019; NHCC: National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China;MCMC: Markov Chain Monte Carlo method; R0: Basic reproduction number; Rc; Control reproduction number;Re(t): Effective daily reproduction ratio.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.HW designed research; HW conceived the experiments, HW, JC and GY conducted the experiments and analyzedthe results; HW and GJ wrote the manuscript.
