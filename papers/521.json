Cycle threshold values, ie, number of cyclesrequired for the fluorescent signal to cross the threshold inRT-PCR, quantified viral load, with lower values indicatinghigher viral load.Samples were collected on 5 days over a 2-week period. Onepatient\u2019s room was sampled before routine cleaning and 2patients\u2019 rooms after routine cleaning. Twice-daily cleaning ofhigh-touch areas was done using 5000 ppm of sodiumdichloroisocyanurate. The floor was cleaned daily using 1000 ppmof sodium dichloroisocyanurate.Clinical data (symptoms, day of illness, and RT-PCRresults) and timing of cleaning were collected and correlated withsampling results. Percentage positivity was calculated forrooms with positive environmental swabs. Institutionalreview board approval and written informed consent wereobtained as part of a larger multicenter study.Results | Patient A\u2019s room was sampled on days 4 and 10 ofillness while the patient was still symptomatic, after routinecleaning. All samples were negative. Patient B wassymptomatic on day 8 and asymptomatic on day 11 of illness; samplestaken on these 2 days after routine cleaning were negative(Table 1).Patient C, whose samples were collected before routinecleaning, had positive results, with 13 (87%) of 15 room sites(including air outlet fans) and 3 (60%) of 5 toilet sites (toiletbowl, sink, and door handle) returning positive results (Table 2).Anteroom and corridor samples were negative. Patient C hadupper respiratory tract involvement with no pneumonia andhad 2 positive stool samples for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCRdespite not having diarrhea.Patient C had greater viral shedding, with a cyclethreshold value of 25.69 in nasopharyngeal samples compared with31.31 and 35.33 in patients A and B (Table 1).Only 1 PPE swab, from the surface of a shoe front, waspositive. All other PPE swabs were negative. All air sampleswere negative.Discussion | There was extensive environmentalcontamination by 1 SARS-CoV-2 patient with mild upper respiratory tractinvolvement. Toilet bowl and sink samples were positive,sugBC4, 108, 11Presenceof symptomsduring samplingYesa Disease severity was considered moderate if there was lung involvement(opacities on chest radiograph) and severe if patient required supplementaloxygen therapy.b Clinical samples were either nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples ifpatient could produce sputum.

Postcleaning samples were negative,suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient.Air samples were negative despite the extent ofenvironmental contamination. Swabs taken from the air exhaust outletstested positive, suggesting that small virus-laden droplets maybe displaced by airflows and deposited on equipment such asvents. The positive PPE sample was unsurprising because shoecovers are not part of PPE recommendations. The risk oftransmission from contaminated footwear is likely low, as evidencedby negative results in the anteroom and clean corridor.This study has several limitations. First, viral culture wasnot done to demonstrate viability. Second, due tooperational limitations during an outbreak, methodology wasinconsistent and sample size was small. Third, the volume of airsampled represents only a small fraction of total volume, andair exchanges in the room would have diluted the presence ofSARS-CoV-2 in the air. Further studies are required toconfirm these preliminary results.Significant environmental contamination by patients withSARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets and fecal sheddingsuggests the environment as a potential medium oftransmission and supports the need for strict adherence toenvironmental and hand hygiene.Sean Wei Xiang Ong, MBBSYian Kim Tan, PhDPo Ying Chia, MBBSTau Hong Lee, MBBSOon Tek Ng, MBBS, MPHMichelle Su Yen Wong, PhDKalisvar Marimuthu, MBBSAuthor Affiliations: National Centre for Infectious Diseases, Singapore (Ong,Chia, Lee, Ng, Marimuthu); DSO National Laboratories, Singapore (Tan, Wong).Accepted for Publication: February 27, 2020.
