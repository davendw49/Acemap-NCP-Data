The isolated virus described here will serve as the US reference strain to be used in research, drug discovery and vaccine testing. Running title: Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020", "text": "The etiologic agent of the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan China in January-2020, wasidentified as severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) . Thefirst US patient was diagnosed by the State of Washington and the US Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention on January 20, 2020. We isolated virus from nasopharyngeal andoropharyngeal specimens, and characterized the viral sequence, replication properties, and cellculture tropism. We found that the virus replicated to high titers in Vero-CCL81 cells and VeroE6 cells in the absence of trypsin. We also deposited the virus into two virus repositories, makingit broadly available to the public health and research communities. We hope that open access tothis important reagent will expedite development of medical countermeasures.        A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),has been identified as the source of a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan China in late 2019 (                  A patient with confirmed COVID-19 was identified in Washington State on January 22,2020 with cycle threshold (Cts) of 18-20 (nasopharyngeal (NP)) and 21-22 (oropharyngeal (OP))(          Isolates from the first passage of an OP and an NP specimen were used for whole genomesequencing. The genomes from the NP specimen (Genbank accession MT020880) and OPspecimen (Genbank accession MT020881) matched each other 100%. The isolates also matchedthe corresponding OP clinical specimen 100% (Genbank accession MN985325).After the second passage, OP and NP specimens were not cultured separately, and theisolate was named SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. Virus isolate was passaged two more times inVero CCL-81 cells, and titrated by TCID50. The titers of the third and fourth passages were 8.65x 106 and 7.65 x 106 TCID50 per mL, respectively.          sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has an RRAR insertion at the S1-S2 interface that may be cleaved byfurin (                    We subsequently generated a fourth passage stock of SARS-CoV-2 on VeroE6 cells,another fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line. Viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2 passage four stockwas sequenced and confirmed to have no nucleotide mutations compared with the originalreference sequence (Genbank accession MN985325). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV hadbeen found to grow well on VeroE6 and Vero CCL81 respectively (                    As research is initiated to study and respond to SARS-CoV-2, information about cell linetropism is needed. Therefore, we examined the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicatein several common primate and human cell lines, including human adenocarcinoma cells (A549),human liver cells (HUH7.0), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T), in addition toVero E6 and Vero CCL81. We also examined an available big brown bat kidney cell line(EFK3B) for SARS-CoV-2 replication capacity. Each cell line was inoculated with at high MOIand examined 24 hours post infection (Figure 3A). No cytopathic effect was observed in any ofthe cell lines except in Vero cells which grew to >107 PFU at 24 hours post infection. In contrast,both HUH7.0 and 293T cells showed only modest viral replication and A549 cells wereincompatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results are consistent with previoussusceptibility findings for SARS-CoV(          Having established robust infection with SARS-CoV-2 in several cell types, we nextevaluated the cross reactivity of SARS-CoV antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2. Cell lysatesfrom infected cell lines were probed for protein analysis; we found that antibodies against theSARS-CoV spike and nucleocapsid proteins recognize SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3B & C). The Nprotein, highly conserved across the group 2B family, retains >90% amino acid identity betweenSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with the replication results (Figure 3A),SARS-CoV2 showed robust N protein in both Vero cell types, less protein in HUH7.0 and 293T, andminimal signal in A549 and EFK3B cells (Figure 3B). Similarly, the SARS-CoV spike antibodyalso recognized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, indicating cross reactivity (Figure 3C). Consistentwith SARS CoV, several cleaved and uncleaved forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.Notably, the cleavage pattern to the the SARS spike positive control from Calu3 cells, arespiratory cell line, varies slightly and could signal differences between proteolytic cleavage ofthe spike proteins between the two viruses. However, differences in cell type and conditionscomplicate this interpretation and indicate the need to further study in equivalent systems.Overall, the protein expression data from SARS-CoV N and S antibodies recapitulate replicationfindings and indicate that SARS-CoV reagents can be utilized to characterize SARS-CoV-2infection.The SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 viral strain described above has been deposited intoBEI reagent resources (ATCC) and the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses andArboviruses (WRCEVA, UTMB) to serve as the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain for the UnitedStates. The SARS-CoV-2 fourth passage virus has been sequenced and the nucleotide sequenceis identical to that of the original US clinical strain. This deposit makes it available to thedomestic and international public health, academic, and pharmaceutical sectors for basicresearch, diagnostic development, antiviral testing, and vaccine development. We hope broadaccess will expedite countermeasure development and testing, in addition to facilitating a betterunderstanding of the transmissibility and pathogenesis of this novel emerging virus.        Virus isolation from patient samples was deemed to be non-human subjects research by CDCNational Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases (research determination0900f3eb81ab4b6e). Clinical specimens from the first identified US case of COVID-19 acquiredduring travel to China, were collected as described (                Vero CCL-81 cells were used for isolation and initial passage. Vero E6, Vero CCL-81, HUH 7.0,293T, A549, and EFKB3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s minimal essential medium (DMEM)supplemented with heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (5 or 10%) and anti/anti antibiotic(GIBCO). Both NP an OP swabs were used for virus isolation. For the isolation, limitingdilution, and passage 1 of the virus, 50 \u00b5 l serum free DMEM was pipetted into columns 2-12 ofa 96-well tissue culture plate. One-hundred \u00b5 l clinical specimens were pipetted into column 1,and then serially diluted 2-fold across the plate. Vero cells were trypsinized and resuspended inDMEM + 10% FBS + 2X Penicillin-Streptomycin + 2X antibiotic \u2013 antimycotic + 2 Xamphotericin B at 2.5 x 105 cells / ml. One hundred \u00b5 l of cell suspension were added directly tothe clinical specimen dilutions and mixed gently by pipetting. The inoculated cultures weregrown in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and observed for cytopathic effect (CPE)daily. Standard plaque assays were used for SARS-CoV-2 based on both SARS-CoV andMERS-CoV protocols (        When CPE were observed, the cell monolayers were scraped with the back of a pipette tip. Fifty\u00b5l of the viral lysate were used for total nucleic acid extraction for confirmatory testing andsequencing. Fifty \u00b5l of virus lysate was used to inoculate a well of a 90% confluent 24-wellplate.        From the wells in which CPE were observed, confirmatory testing was performed using CDC\u2019sSARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assay (                Whole genome sequencing. Thirty-seven pairs of nested PCR assays spanning the genome weredesigned based on the reference sequence, Genbank Accession No. NC045512. Nucleic acid wasextracted from isolates and amplified by the 37 individual nested PCR assays. Positive PCRamplicons were used individually for subsequent Sanger sequencing and also pooled for librarypreparation using a ligation sequencing kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK),subsequently for Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing. Consensus Nanopore sequences weregenerated using minimap 2.17 and samtools 1.9 (                To sequence passage four stock, libraries for sequencing were prepared with the NEB Next UltraII RNA Prep Kit (New England BioLabs, Inc., Ipswich, MA) following the manufacturer\u2019sprotocol. Briefly, ~70-100 ng of RNA was fragmented for 15 minutes, followed by cDNAsynthesis, end repair and adapter ligation. After 6 rounds of PCR the libraries were analyzed onan Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified by qPCR. Samples were pooled and sequenced with apaired-end 75 base protocol on an Illumina (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA) MiniSeq instrumentusing the High-Output kit. Reads were processed with Trimmomatic v0.36 (        Infected Vero cells were scraped from the flask, pelleted by low speed centrifugation, rinsed with0.1M phosphate buffer, pelleted again and fixed for 2 hours in 2.5% buffered glutaraldehyde.Specimens were post fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, en bloc staining with 4% uranyl acetate,dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with 4% uranylacetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Thermo Fisher/FEI Tecnai Spirit electronmicroscope.Protein Analysis and Western Blot. Cell lysates were harvested with Laemmli SDS-PAGEsample buffer (Bio RAD, Hercules CA) containing a final concentration of 2% SDS and 5%\u03b2mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates were the boiled and removed from the BSL3. The lysates werethen loaded onto a poly-acrylamide gel, and SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidenedifluoride PVDF membrane. The membrane was then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk dissolvedin Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 hour, followed by a short TBS-Twash. Overnight incubation with primary antibody, either SARS-CoV spike antibody (SinoBiological #40150-T52), \u03b2-Actin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology #4970), or a customSARS-CoV nucleocapsid antibody, was then performed. After primary antibody incubation, themembrane was washed 3x with TBS-T, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondaryantibody was applied for 1 hour. Subsequently, the membrane was washed 3x with TBS-T, andincubated with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad #1705060S), and imaged with amultipurpose imaging system.
