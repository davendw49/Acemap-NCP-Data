Early molecular epidemiological tracing suggests that SARS-CoV-2 was presentin Italy weeks before the first reported cases of infection.A new coronavirus causing severe respiratory diseases, closely related to SARS-CoV, called SARS-CoV-2, wasdescribed for the first time in the city of Wuhan, in the Hubei province of internal China, on late December2019 (https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/). The virusbelongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family showing a 96% genomic identity with apreviously detected SARS-like bat coronavirus 1,2. Since then the virus has spread in several continentsbeing declared, on 30 January 2020, from the World Health Organisation (WHO) a Public Health Emergencyof International Concern(https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-secondcasesand5,088countriesWorldcf6). In the last few days important concerns raised about the increasing numbers of cases outside of China,in particular in South Korea, Iran and Italy even though in February, 26 the WHO Director-General\u2019sdeclared that since the day before, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the numberof new cases in China(https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarksFollowing the imported cases of two Chinese travellers on January 31, on February 21, the first cluster of 16Italian cases have been reported in the Italian Northern region of Lombardy. Since than the number ofnotified new cases has grown exponentially, reaching, as of March, 13, a total of 15,113 cases and 1,016deaths. Other confirmed cases of infection were then reported in several Italian regions such Veneto,We have now made the isolation of the virus, the molecular characterization and the phylogenetic analysisof three complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from three of the first 16 cases observed, none ofwhom reported a recent history of travel outside Italy.All data used in the study were previously anonymized, according to the requirements set by Italian DataProtection Code (leg. Decree 196/2003) and by the General authorizations issued by the Data ProtectionAuthority. Approval by Ethics Committee was deemed unnecessary because, under Italian law, such anapproval is required only in the hypothesis of prospective clinical trials on medical products for clinical use(art. 6 and art. 9, leg. Decree 211/2003). Written informed consent for any other medicalprocedures/interventions performed for routine treatment purposes was collected for each patient.The first subject (F.A.) was 71 years-old, he had been transferred to Sacco Hospital form the ICU of LodiHospital. The onset of his symptoms was February 15 and moved to our Unit on February 21, with apositive result for SARS-CoV-2 from a naso-pharingeal swab. He died on March 3 from respiratory failure.The second subject (Z.B.) was 80 years-old, he had been transferred to our Hospital form the ICU of LodiHospital. The onset of his symptoms was February 15 and moved to our Unit on February 22, with apositive result for SARS-CoV-2 from a naso-pharingeal swab. He died on March 1 from respiratory failure.The third subject (R.G.) was 76 years-old, he had been transferred to our Hospital form the InternalMedicine ward of Lodi Hospital. The onset of his symptoms was February 13 and moved to our Unit onFebruary 22, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 from a naso-pharingeal swab. He died on March 8 fromAll three subjects presented with fever (> 38.5 \u00b0C), dry cough and dyspnea on top of metaboliccomorbidities and/or hypertension. They all had a controlled mechanical ventilation and resuscitationassistance, and started treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir 400/100mg oral solution bis-in-die the same dayof admission to Sacco Hospital. Their chest X-ray presented bilateral ground-glass opacities of lung basesand a certain degree of interstitial-alveolar edema, which did not improve during their hospital stay.After isolating the virus in Vero cells, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from the culture supernatant after 24hours, and the full genome was obtained by amplifying 26 fragments using previously published specificprimers 3. The PCR products were used to prepare a library for Illumina deep sequencing using a Nextera XTDNA Sample Preparation and Index kit (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) in accordance with themanufacturer\u2019s manual, and sequencing was carried out on a Illumina MiSeq platform using the 2\u00d7150cycle paired-end sequencing protocol. The results were mapped and aligned to the reference genomeobtained from Gisaid (https://www.gisaid.org/, accession ID: EPI_ISL_412973) using Geneious software, v.9.1.5 (http://www.geneious.com) 4.The genomes obtained from the three Italian patients\u2019 were aligned with a total of 157 SARS-CoV-2genomes obtained worldwide and publicly available at GISAID on 3 March 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/),and an additional Italian strain that became available during the study. Table S1 shows the accession IDs,and sampling dates and locations of the sequences included in the dataset.In order to investigate the temporal signal of the data set, a root-to-tip regression analysis was performedby using TempEst 5.The Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model with a proportion of invariant sites (HKY+I) was selected as the simplestevolutionary model by means of JmodelTest, v. 2.1.7 (3), and the phylogenetic analysis was made using aBayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST, v.1.8.4 6.Two coalescent priors (constant population size, exponential growth) and strict vs. relaxed molecular clockmodels were tested by means of Path Sampling (PS) and Stepping Stone (SS) sampling 7. Because thetemporal signal was weak in the dataset (see Results section) the evolutionary rate was set to the valuesobtained fromrecent independent estimates8(http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-176genomes-6-mar-2020/356). The time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were calculated inAll of the genes were tested for selection pressure using Datamonkey (https://www.datamonkey.org/).The investigation of the temporal signal in the data set by root-to-tip regression exhibited a relatively weakassociation between genetic distances and sampling days (correlation coefficient=0.46 and a coefficient ofdetermination R2 of 0.21, Fig.1).The comparison of the marginal likelihoods of strict vs relaxed molecular clock and constant vs exponentialcoalescent models showed that the model best fitting the data was the exponential coalescent prior (PS BFexponential growth vs. constant =968.2, SS BF exponential growth vs. constant =-967.5) under a log-normalrelaxed clock (PS BF strict vs. relaxed clock =-2, SS BF strict vs. relaxed clock =-1.6).mainly in a basal position with respect to the other sequences. The three Italian genomes clustered in asingle highly supported clade (clade A, highlighted in Figure 1; posterior probability, pp=1) that alsoincluded two recently characterised genomes from Italy obtained from patients involved in the sameoutbreak in Lombardy, three isolates from Europe (two from Germany, one from Finland), and two LatinAmerican sequences (one from Mexico and one from Brazil). One of the German isolates (from Bavaria,EPI_ISL_406862) was at the outgroup of the highly supported subclade (pp=1) including all of the otherstrains, and the other German sequence shared a highly supported node (pp=1) with the MexicanTable 1 summarizes the estimated mean tMRCAs of the tree root and of the main significant clades (node Aand node B and node C in Figure 1). The estimated mean tMRCA of the tree-root was 135 days before thepresent (95%HPD: 100.4-182.6), corresponding to 23 October 2019 (credibility interval 4 September-26November). The estimated mean tMRCA of node A was 44.5 days before the present (95%HPD: 35-56.6),corresponding to 20 January 2020 (credibility interval 8-30 January 2020), and the estimated mean tMRCAof the node B was 38.5 days before the present (95%HPD: 29.3-49.5), corresponding to 26 January 2020(credibility interval 15 January-5 February). Finally, the estimated mean tMRCA of the internal nodebetween the Mexican and the German isolates was 17.8 days before the present (95%HPD: 8-29),corresponding to 16 February 2020 (credibility interval 5-26 February).Comparison of the genetic distances estimated on the basis of the number of nucleotide substitutionsindicated a mean 7.8 nucleotide substitutions between the isolates in Clade A (range 0-24 nucleotidesubstitutions). Three sequences (two Italian and one Brazilian) were identical, whereas one Italian strainhad a difference of as many as 18 nucleotides from the outgroup sequence fromThe present phylogenetic analysis confirms that the common origin of the SARS-CoV-2 strains characterisedso far was several weeks before the first cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were described in China 8. It alsoshowed that the whole genomes of the three SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients in northern Italyand characterised by us are closely related to each other, as well as to the other two published Italiansequences, and the German, Finnish, Mexican and Brazilian sequences, all of which formed a highlysupported clade. One of the German sequences was at the outgroup of the clade.This sequence came from a COVID-19 outbreak reported between 20 and 24 January and occurring afterbusiness meetings with a Shanghai business woman who tested positive after returning to China 9. OurtMRCA estimation showed that the root of clade A was in the month of January 2020 a period compatiblewith this event. Nevertheless, our data cannot allow to make hypotheses on the possible routes followedby the virus to reach Italy, because it is impossible to infer the directionality of transmission, given thelimited number of sparsely sampled sequences in the tree, which means that multiple independentimportations to Europe cannot be excluded.Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus entered Northern Italy between the second half of January andearly February 2020, weeks before the first Italian case of COVID-19 was identified and therefore longbefore the current containment measures were taken.Interestingly, although they were sampled in the same area on the same day, the genomes isolated fromthese three patients have a number of different, mainly synonymous substitutions. In particular, onepatient living near the municipality in which the highest number of cases was recorded showed a highdegree of genomic heterogeneity, thus suggesting considerable genetic drift.In conclusion, our data show that the SARS-CoV-2 isolates which infected the Italian patients involved in theearly epidemic in northern Italy and also isolated from other European and Latin America from patientsreporting contacts with Italy, are closely related to the same strain isolated during one of the first Europeanclusters, occurred in Bavaria in late January 2020 10. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis alone wecannot exclude possible multiple introductions in Germany and Italy from China (or other countries).Nevertheless, the epidemiological data showing that the first cases in Germany preceded the first ones inItaly by almost a month, suggest that the strain entered Germany before Italy. Finally, we havecharacterized only three genomes and we cannot exclude the presence in Italy of other different strainswhich could be the result of multiple introductions. Further epidemiological and molecular investigationson a larger sample are needed to clarify all these issues.FIGURE LEGENDcharacterized in this study are evidenced with a symbol.
