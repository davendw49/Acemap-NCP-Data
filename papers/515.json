Risk assessment at that time was guarded but suggested that the outbreak was more like that caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. However, this information was from what now appears to be first-generation cases from a point source, but at the time it seems that a second generation, and perhaps a third generation, of cases was already reported in the incubation period, and this generation appears to have included health workers. Health worker infections are an ominous nfiding in any emerging infection. Front-line health workers can be initially at risk and infected when they examine and treat patients who present with a respiratory infection; if handwashing or other infection prevention and control measures are not in place, these health workers are at great risk of infection and become the inadvertent carriers to patients who are in hospital for other diseases and treatments, family members, and the community. Early in the SARS coronavirus outbreak, frontline health workers became infected, which ampliefid transmission to patients in hospitals where outbreaks were occurring.4 Early evidence from the initial MERS outbreaks suggested that health workers were likewise being infected, but that their infections were less severe", "text": "Published Online In December, 2019, Wuhan, Hubei province, China,https://dJaoni.uoarrgy/1204.,12001260/ became the centre of an outbreak of pneumoniaS0140-6736(20)30185-9 of unknown cause, which raised intense attentionThis online publication has been not only within China but internationally.

By Jan 7, 2020,Chinese scientists had isolated a novel coronavirus(CoV) from patients in Wuhan. The genetic sequenceof the 2019 novel coronavir        In The Lancet, Chaolin Huang and colleagues7 reportclinical features of the rfist 41 patients admitted to thedesignated hospital in Wuhan who were conrfimedto be infected with 2019-nCoV by Jan 2, 2020. Thestudy nfidings provide rfist-hand data about severityof the emerging 2019-nCoV infection. Symptomsresulting from 2019-nCoV infection at the prodromalphase, including fever, dry cough, and malaise, arenonspecicfi. Unlike human coronavirus infections, upperrespiratory symptoms are notably infrequent. Intestinalpresentations observed with SARS also appear to beuncommon, although two of six cases reported by Chanand colleagues had diarrhoea.6 Common laboratorynifdings on admission to hospital include lymphopeniaand bilateral ground-glass opacity or consolidation inchest CT scans. These clinical presentations confoundedearly detection of infected cases, especially against abackground of ongoing inuflenza and circulation ofother respiratory viruses. Exposure history to the HuananSeafood Wholesale market served as an important clueat the early stage, yet its value has decreased as moresecondary and tertiary cases have appeared.Of the 41 patients in this cohort, 22 (55%) developedsevere dyspnoea and 13 (32%) required admissionto an intensive care unit, and six died.7 Hence, thecase-fatality proportion in this cohort isapproximately 14\u00b76%, and the overall case fatality proportionappears to be closer to 3% (table). However, both ofthese estimates should be treated with great cautionbecause not all patients have concluded their illness(ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infectionsand full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly,in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatalityratio is often overestimated in the early stages becausecase detection is highly biased towards the moresevere cases. As further data on the spectrum of mildor asymptomatic infection becomes available, one caseof which was documented by Chan and colleagues,6 thecase-fatality ratio is likely to decrease. Nevertheless,the 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to havehad a case-fatality ratio of less than 5%13 but had anenormous impact due to widespread transmission, sothere is no room for complacency.Dec 30, 2019Cluster of cases of pneumoniaof unknown origin reported toChina National HealthCommissionJan 7, 2020Novel coronavirusisolatedJan 13, 2020First case inThailand reportedJan 11, 2020First fatalcase reportedJan 1, 2020Huanan Seafood Wholesalemarket closedJan 12, 2020Named as 2019-nCoV;whole genome sequenceshared with WHOJan 20, 2020Infection inhealth-care workerscaring for 2019-nCoVpatients2019-nCoV*MERS-CoVSARS-CoV        As an RNA vir                Two previous coronavirus outbreaks had beenreported in the 21st century. The clinical featuresof 2019-nCoV, in comparison with SARS-CoV andMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, aresummarised in the table. The ongoing 2019-nCoVoutbreak has undoubtedly caused the memoriesof the SARS-CoV outbreak starting 17 years ago toresurface in many people. In November, 2002, clustersof pneumonia of unknown cause were reportedin Guangdong province, China, now known as theSARS-CoV outbreak. The number of cases of SARSincreased substantially in the next year in China andlater spread globally,14 infecting at least 8096 peopleand causing 774 deaths.12 The international spreadof SARS-CoV in 2003 was attributed to its strongtransmission ability under specific circumstances andthe insuficient preparedness and implementation ofinfection control practices. Chinese public health andscientific capabilities have been greatly transformedsince 2003. An eficient system is ready for monitoringand responding to infectio        The increasing number of cases and wideninggeographical spread of the disease raise grave concernsabout the future trajectory of the outbreak, especiallywith the Chinese Lunar New Year quickly approaching.Under normal circumstances, an estimated 3 billiontrips would be made in the Spring Festival travel rushthis year, with 15 million trips happening in Wuhan. Thevirus might further spread to other places during thisfestival period and cause epidemics, especially if it hasacquired the ability to eficiently transmit from personto person.Consequently, the 2019-nCoV outbreak has ledto implementation of extraordinary public healthmeasures to reduce further spread of the viruswithin China and elsewhere. Although WHO has notrecommended any international travelling restrictionsso far,15 the local government in Wuhan announced onJan 23, 2020, the suspension of public transportation,with closure of airports, railway stations, and highwaysin the city, to prevent further disease transmission.16Further eforts in travel restriction might follow. Activesurveillance for new cases and close monitoring of theircontacts are being implemented. To improve detectioneficiency, front-line clinics, apart from local centres fordisease control and prevention, should be armed withvalidated point-of-care diagnostic kits.Rapid information disclosure is a top priority for diseasecontrol and prevention. A daily press release systemhas been established in China to ensure eefctive andecfiient disclosure of epidemic information. Educationcampaigns should be launched to promote precautionsfor travellers, including frequent hand-washing, coughetiquette, and use of personal protection equipment(eg, masks) when visiting public places. Also, the generalpublic should be motivated to report fever and other riskfactors for coronavirus infection, including travel historyto aefcted area and close contacts with conrfimed orsuspected cases.Considering that substantial numbers of patientswith SARS and MERS were infected in health-caresettings, precautions need to be taken to preventnosocomial spread of the virus. Unfortunately,16 health-care workers, some of whom were workingin the same ward, have been confirmed to be infectedwith 2019-nCoV to date, although the routes oftransmission and the possible role of so-calledsuperspreaders remain to be clarified. 9 Epidemiologicalstudies need to be done to assess risk factors forinfection in health-care personnel and quantifypotential subclinical or asymptomatic infections.Notably, the transmission of SARS-CoV was eventuallyhalted by public health measures including eliminationof nosocomial infections. We need to be wary of thecurrent outbreak turning into a sustained epidemic oreven a pandemic.The availability of the virus\u2019 genetic sequenceand initial data on the epidemiology and clinicalconsequences of the 2019-nCoV infections are onlythe first steps to understanding the threat posed bythis pathogen. Many important questions remainunanswered, including its origin, extent, and durationof transmission in humans, ability to infect other animalhosts, and the spectrum and pathogenesis of humaninfections. Characterising viral isolates from successivegenerations of human infections will be key to updatingdiagnostics and assessing viral evolution. Beyondsupportive care,17 no specific coronavirus antivirals orvaccines of proven eficacy in humans exist, althoughclinical trials of both are ongoing for MERS-CoV andone controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavirmonotherapyhasbeen launchedfor2019-nCoV(ChiCTR2000029308). Future animal model and clinicalstudies should focus on assessing the efectivenessand safety of promising antiviral drugs, monoclonaland polyclonal neutralising antibody products, andtherapeutics directed against immunopathologic hostresponses.We have to be aware of the challenge and concernsbrought by 2019-nCoV to our community.
