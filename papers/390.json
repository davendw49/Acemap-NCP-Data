It is currently no specific viral proteintargeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, servingmultiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information ofSARSCoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the 2.7 \u00c5 crystalstructure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein.Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid proteinNterminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct.Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a uniquepotential RNA binding pocket alongside the b-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro bindingstudies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsidprotein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting toCrystal structure, Antiviral targeting site39404142434445464748495051525354555657The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging humaninfectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2, SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV). As of 28 February 2020, a cumulative total of78,961 COVID-19 cases were confirmed with 2791 deaths in China. The emerged globalepidemic spread rapidly with 4691 confirmed cases and 67 deaths across 51 countries outsideof China (COVID-19 situation Report WHO, 28 Feb 2020). Despite remarkable efforts oncontaining spread of the virus, there is no specific targeted therapeutic currently.SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with single-stranded RNA genomes, like MERS-CoV andSARS-CoV. The first two-thirds of viral 30kb RNA genome, mainly named as ORF1a/b region,translates into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) and encodes most of the non-structuralproteins (nsp). The rest parts of virus genome encode accessory proteins and four essentialstructural proteins, including spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M)protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein1,2. Current antiviral drugs developed to treat coronavirus(CoV) infections primarily target S protein, the 3C-like (3CL) and papain-like (PLP) proteases3,4.Because mutant viruses in the S protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic withdifferent host-cell receptor binding patterns4, as well as antibody-dependent enhancement(ADE) effects of S protein antibodies are found in MERS coronavirus5, there are several limitationson targeting S protein for antiviral approaches. Antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically59606162636465666768697071727374757677act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects.Therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections causedby this novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.The CoV N protein is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein necessary for viral RNAtranscription and replication. It plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteinsduring packaging the RNA genome, regulating viral RNA synthesis during replication,transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism6-8. The primary functions of N protein arebinding to the viral RNA genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structureor ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex9,10. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that N proteinbound to leader RNA, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered RNA conformation suitablefor replicating, and transcribing the viral genome7,11. More studies implicated that N proteinregulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression,and apoptosis12-14. The N protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed proteinduring infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against SARS-CoV andSARS-CoV-215-18.The common domain architectures of coronavirus N protein are consisting of three distinct buthighly conserved parts: An N-terminal RNA-binding domain (NTD), a C-terminal dimerizationdomain (CTD), and intrinsically disordered central Ser/Arg (SR)-rich linker. Previous studies haverevealed that the NTD are responsible for RNA binding, CTD for oligomerization, and (SR)-richlinker for primary phosphorylation, respectively19-23. The crystal structures of SARS-CoV N-NTD24,798081828384858687888990919293949596infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N-NTD25,26, HCoV-OC43 N-NTD20 and mouse hepatitis virus(MHV) N-NTD27 have been solved. The CoVs N-NTD have been found to associate with the 3'end of the viral RNA genome, possibly through electrostatic interactions. Additionally, severalcritical residues have been identified for RNA binding and virus infectivity in the N-terminaldomain of coronavirus N proteins24,27-29. However, the structural and mechanistic basis for newlyemerged novel SARS-CoV-2 N protein remain largely unknown. Understanding these aspectsshould facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the coronavirus replication,transcription and viral assembly30.At present work, we report the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N-terminaldomain (termed as SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD), as a model for understanding the molecularinteractions that govern SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD binding to ribonucleotides. Compared with othersolved CoVs N-NTD, we characterized the specificity surface electrostatic potential features ofSARS-CoV-2 N-NTD. Additionally, we further demonstrated the unique RNA binding sitecharacteristics. Our findings will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral Nprotein and viral replication in SARS-CoV-2, and highly related virus SARS-CoV.The SARS-CoV-2 N-FL plasmid is a gift from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center.We designed several constructs including: SARS-CoV-2 N-FL (residues from 1 to 419),SARS9899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116CoV-2 N-NTD domain (residues from 41 to 174) and SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD domain (residuesfrom 33 to 180) depending on secondary structure predictions and sequence conservationcharacteristics. The constructs were cloned into the pRSF-Duet-1 vector with N-terminal6xHisSUMO tag and expressed in E. coli strain Rosetta. SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was induced with 0.1mMIPTG and incubated overnight at 16 \u00b0C in TB media. After Ni column chromatography followedby Ulp1 protease digestion for tag removal, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD (41-174) proteins were furtherpurified via size-exclusion chromatography (with buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol), and then concentrated by ultrafiltration to a finalconcentration of 22 mg/mL.Crystallization and data collection Crystals were grown by the sitting drop method with 0.3ulprotein\uff0822 mg/mL\uff09 mixed with 0.6 \u03bcL and 0.3 \u03bcL well solution using Mosquito crystallizationrobot and after 3 days initial crystallization was performed under 16 \u00b0C under 20 mM sodiumacetate, 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 26 % PEG8000 conditions. Crystals were frozen inliquid nitrogen in reservoir solution supplemented with 15 % glycerol (v/v) as a cryoprotectant.X-ray diffraction data were collected at the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, ChineseAcademy of Sciences by Rigaku X-ray diffraction (XRD) instruments. The structure was solvedby molecular replacement using PHENIX software suite31. The X-ray diffraction and structurerefinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.SPR Analysis. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed using a Biacore T200with the CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD118119120121122123124125126127128129(41\u2013174) were exchanged into PBS buffer via gel-filtration. The CM5 chip surface was activatedfor 10\u2009min using 0.2\u2009 M EDC/ 0.05\u2009 M NHS. After the injection of 30 \u2009\u03bcg/mL protein in 10\u2009 mMsodium acetate (pH 5.5) for three times to immobilize on one of channels of the CM5 chip upto \u223c5,800 response units, 10\u2009 \u03bcL of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.0) was used for blocking theremaining activated groups. Each of the analytes (AMP, GMP, UMP, CMP) were dissolve in PBS(pH 7.4, 0.05 % NP-20) and flowed through the chip surface at flow rate of 30 \u2009\u03bcL/min at 25 \u00b0C.30\u2009 \u03bcL analytes were injected for affinity analysis with 60 s dissociation time. To understandingdose dependent affinity of analytes and SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD, we tested nine dilutions ofanalytes from 0.15625 mM to 10 mM. A blank flow channel was used as a reference channel tocorrect the bulk refractive index by subtracting the response signal of the reference channelfrom the signals of protein immobilized cells. The equilibrium constant (KD) for analytes bindingto SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined from the association and dissociation curves of thesensorgrams, using the BIAevaluation program (Biacore).131Results132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149It is reported that the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947, Wuhan-Hu-1 coronavirus)is 29.9 kb in length, similarly to 27.9 kb SARS-CoV and 30.1 kb MERS-CoV genome32,33 (Fig. 1A).Nucleocapsid (N) protein is translated from the 3\u2019 end structural ORF34-36. According to VirusVariation Resource in National Center for Biotechnology Information databank37, SARS-CoV-2N protein encoding region are conserved among the known NCBI 103 genome datasets. Onlya few variations (S194L in virus strain Foshan/20SF207/2020, K249I in virus strainWuhan/IVDCHB-envF13-21/2020, P344S in virus strain Guangzhou/20SF206/2020) in N protein are found inpublic genomic epidemiology. An overall domain architecture of N protein among fourcoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43) are shown in Figure 1B,which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 shares typical characteristics with other coronaviruses. Zoominto the completed genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 N protein encoding region, we find thatthe sequence identities between SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43are 89.74%, 48.59%, 35.62%, respectively (Fig. S1)38,39. Since full-length SARS-CoV-2 N proteinaggregated status were found in our expression and purification studies (Fig. S2), as well asprevious reported data on other coronavirus nucleocapsid protein, we next investigate thestructural studies on N-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 N protein (termed as SARS-CoV-2NNTD).Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170In order to obtain the atomic information of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD, we solve the structure at 2.7\u00c5 resolution using X-ray crystallography technology. Briefly, 47-173 residues of SARS-CoV-2 Nprotein were constructed, expressed and purified as described protocol (Materials and Methods).The structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined by molecular replacement using theSARS-CoV N-NTD structure (PDB:2OG3) as the search model24. The final structure was refinedto R-factor and R-free values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively. The complete statistics for datacollection, phasing and refinement are presented in Table 1. Unlike to SARS-CoV N-NTD crystalspacking modes (monoclinic form at 2OFZ, cubic form at 2OG3)24, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD crystalshows orthorhombic crystal packing form with four N-NTD monomers in one asymmetry unit(Fig. 2A). Although lacks of evidence for real RNP organization in the mature virions, thedifferences in the crystal packing patterns may implicate other potential contacts inSARS-CoV2 RNP formation process. All four monomers in one asymmetric unit of the SARS-CoV-2NNTD crystal structure shared similar right-handed (loops)-(b-sheet core)-(loops) sandwichedstructure, as conserved among the CoVs N-NTD (Fig. 2B). The b-sheet core is consisted of fiveantiparallel b-strands with a single short 310 helix just before strand b2, and a protrudingbhairpin between strands b2 and b5. The b-hairpin is functionally important for CoV N-NTD,implicated in mutational analysis of amino acid residues for RNA binding29 (Fig. 2C). TheSARSCoV-2 N-NTD is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, folding into a hand shape resembleswith basic fingers that extend far beyond the b-sheet core, a basic palm, and an acidic wrist (Fig.2D).Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with related viral N-NTD structures172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190To obtain more specific information, we first mapped the conserved residues betweenSARSCoV-2 N-NTD with SARS-CoV N-NTD, MERS-CoV N-NTD, HCoV-OC443 N-NTD, respectively(Fig 3A). The most conserved residues distribute on the basic palm region (Fig. 3A, blue andgreen region), while the less conserved residues locate in basic fingers and acidic wrist region(Fig. 3A, pink and red region). The available CoVs N-NTD crystal structures allowed us tocompare the electrostatic potential on the surface. As shown in Fig. 3B, although CoV N-NTDsall adapted similar overall organizations, the surface charge distribution patterns are different.Consisting with our observations, previous modeling of related coronaviral N-NTDs also shownmarkedly differ in surface charge distributions24. Superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD withthree kinds of CoVs N-NTD are shown in Fig. 3C. Compared with SARS-CoV N-NTD,SARSCoV-2 N-NTD show a 2.1 \u00c5 movement in the b-hairpin region forward to nucleotide bindingsite (Fig. 3C, left panel). While compared with MERS-CoV N-NTD, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD show aless extended b-hairpin region, and a distinct relax N-treminal tail (Fig. 3C, middle panel). Inconsistently, SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD show a distinct relax N-treminal tail, and a 2 \u00c5 movement inthe b-hairpin region backward to the opposite side of nucleotide binding site when the structureis compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (Fig. 3C, right panel). These differences dramaticallychange the surface characterizations of the protein, may result in the RNA-binding cleft beingadaptive to its own RNA genome.Although there are several CoV N-NTDs structures have been solved, the structural basis for192193194195196197198199200201202203204205206207208209210211ribonucleoside 5\u2019-monophosphate binding of N protein had only been described inHCoVOC43, a relative type typically causing mild cold symptoms40. Since the surface characterizationsof N-NTD between SARS-CoV-2 with HCoV-OC43 are distinct, we next explored the differencesof RNA binding mechanistic basis with superimposition analysis. Previous studies had shownthat, HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contained Adenosinemonophosphate (AMP)/ uridinemonophosphate (UMP)/ cytosine monophosphate (CMP)/ guanosine monophosphate (GMP)binding site alongside the middle two b strands of its b-sheets core40. In the complex structureof HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with ribonucleotides, the phosphate group was bound by Arg 122 andGly 68 via ionic interactions, the pentose sugar ribose 2\u2019-hydroxyl group was recognized bySer 64 and Arg164, the nitrogenous base inserted into a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Phe57, Pro61, Tyr 63, Tyr102, Tyr 124, and Tyr 126, mainly interacted with Tyr 124 via p-p stackingforces (Fig. S3). It is proposed that this ribonucleotide binding mechanism are essential for allcoronavirus N proteins, applying to develop CoV N-NTD-target agents.To obtain the structure information of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD ribonucleotide binding site, wemake a superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD-AMP complex. Asexpectedly, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between these two structure coordinatesare 1.4 \u00c5 over 136 superimposed Ca atoms. However, a number of difference around theribonucleotide binding site were shown as superimposition of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD withHCoVOC43 N-NTD. The major difference is N-terminal tail of N-NTD with sequence variation(SARSCoV-2: 48 NNTA 51 versus HCoV-OC43: 60 VPYY 63). In HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, the tail foldedup to compose a nitrogenous base binding channel, whereas this region extended outward in213214215216217218219220221222223224225226227228229231SARS-CoV-2 one (Fig. 4A). The N-terminal tail movement contributed to the change of N-NTDsurface charge distribution, at which nucleotide binding cavity became easier to accessible inSARS-CoV-2 N-NTD (Fig. 4B and C). The second difference is on phosphate group binding site,which SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD have larger sidechain residues (55 TA 56) compared withHCoVOC43 N-NTD equivalents (67 SG 68) (Fig. 4D). Structural superimposition suggested additionalpolar properties of Thr 55 and Ala 56 in SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD may increase the steric clash withribonucleotide phosphate moiety (Fig. 4E and F). The third difference is on the edge ofnitrogenous base recognized hydrophobic pocket, where SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD had Arg 89residues compared with HCoV-OC43 N-NTD Tyr 102 equivalents (Fig. 4G). The change of theseresidues sidechain may lead to dramatic decreasing of non-polar properties and increasing ofpolar properties in the nitrogenous base binding site (Fig. 4H and I). To evaluate these differentobservations in our structure, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis experiments were nextperformed to assess the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with all four kinds ofribonucleotide AMP/UMP/CMP/GMP. Intriguingly, all ribonucleoside 5\u2019-monophosphate,excepted for GMP (KD value is 8 mM), shown little binding signals in assays (Fig. S4). Takentogether, the above results suggested a potential distinct RNA binding patterns betweenSARSCoV-2 N protein with HCoV-OC43 N protein.Structure-based drug discovery has been shown to be an advance approach for thedevelopment of new therapeutics. Many ongoing studies are developed to treat COVID-19233234235236237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251primarily targeting the spike protein, viral proteases (3C-like protease and papain-like protease).However, there is little effective targeted therapeutic currently. Recent studies demonstratedthat N proteins will be a good drug-targeting candidate in other CoVs since they process severalcritical functions, such as RNA genomic packing, viral transcription and assembly, in theinfectious cell10. However, the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 N protein is yet to be elucidated.Here, we present the 2.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 N protein N-terminal domain,revealing the specific surface charge distributions which may facilitate drug discovery specificallyto SARS-CoV-2 N protein ribonucleotide binding domain.On the structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD, several residues in the ribonucleotide bindingdomain were found to distinctly recognize the CoV RNA substrates. The N-terminal tail residues(Asn 48, Asn 49, Thr 50, and Ala 51) is more flexible and extended outward compared withequivalent residues in HCoV-OC43 N-NTD, possibly opening up the binding pocket into fittingwith viral RNA genomic high order structure. Residues Arg 89, instead of HCoV-OC43 N-NTDTyr 102, may contribute to guanosine base recognition despite the overall ribonucleotidebinding may be excluded by residues Thr 55 and Ala 56 in the phosphate moiety recognitionsite.Up to date, seven coronaviruses have been identified as human-susceptible virus, among whichHCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 with low pathogenicity cause mildrespiratory symptoms similar to common cold, whereas the other three betacoronaviruses,SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV lead to severe and potential fatal respiratory tract253254255256257258260261262263264265266infections32,41,42. Previous study reported the structural basis of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD with AMP,GMP, UMP, CMP and a virtual screening-base compound PJ34. However, our data suggestedthat SARS-CoV-2 employed a unique pattern for binding RNA with atomic resolutioninformation. The structure not only help us to understand the RNA-binding mechanismsbetween severe infectious coronavirus with mild infectious one, but also guide the design ofnovel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.We thank for Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center for providing the N-proteinencoding gene plasmids, Dr. Yongzhi Lu from Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health(Chinese Academy of Sciences) for the initial crystals X-ray diffraction screening, supports fromDr. Xuan Ma of South China Sea Institute of Oceanology (Chinese Academy of Sciences) forhome source X-ray diffraction facility.

It is currently no specific viral proteintargeted therapeutics yet. As of 28 February 2020, a cumulative total of78,961 COVID-19 cases were confirmed with 2791 deaths in China. The emerged globalepidemic spread rapidly with 4691 confirmed cases and 67 deaths across 51 countries outsideof China (COVID-19 situation Report WHO, 28 Feb 2020). Despite remarkable efforts oncontaining spread of the virus, there is no specific targeted therapeutic currently. The CoVs N-NTD have been found to associate with the 3'end of the viral RNA genome, possibly through electrostatic interactions. The structure was solvedby molecular replacement using PHENIX software suite31. 1A).Nucleocapsid (N) protein is translated from the 3\u2019 end structural ORF34-36. Briefly, 47-173 residues of SARS-CoV-2 Nprotein were constructed, expressed and purified as described protocol (Materials and Methods).The structure of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD was determined by molecular replacement using theSARS-CoV N-NTD structure (PDB:2OG3) as the search model24. The complete statistics for datacollection, phasing and refinement are presented in Table 1. TheSARSCoV-2 N-NTD is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, folding into a hand shape resembleswith basic fingers that extend far beyond the b-sheet core, a basic palm, and an acidic wrist (Fig.2D).Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD with related viral N-NTD structures172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190To obtain more specific information, we first mapped the conserved residues betweenSARSCoV-2 N-NTD with SARS-CoV N-NTD, MERS-CoV N-NTD, HCoV-OC443 N-NTD, respectively(Fig 3A). The available CoVs N-NTD crystal structures allowed us tocompare the electrostatic potential on the surface. 3B, although CoV N-NTDsall adapted similar overall organizations, the surface charge distribution patterns are different. 3C. Compared with SARS-CoV N-NTD,SARSCoV-2 N-NTD show a 2.1 \u00c5 movement in the b-hairpin region forward to nucleotide bindingsite (Fig. These differences dramaticallychange the surface characterizations of the protein, may result in the RNA-binding cleft beingadaptive to its own RNA genome. It is proposed that this ribonucleotide binding mechanism are essential for allcoronavirus N proteins, applying to develop CoV N-NTD-target agents. The major difference is N-terminal tail of N-NTD with sequence variation(SARSCoV-2: 48 NNTA 51 versus HCoV-OC43: 60 VPYY 63). The figure is illustrated by SnapGene Viewer; B.
