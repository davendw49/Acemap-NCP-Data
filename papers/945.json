Unfortunately CQ did not showefficacy in inhibiting viral replication in a mouse SARS-CoV model[3]. Nevertheless, by considering its anti-inflammatory properties, ithas been postulated that CQ/HCQ may have some effect on SARS [3,ow26Mprophylactic study in a non-human primate model the infection wasenhanced by CQ treatment; in a curative study on a human cohort,symptoms and viral clearance, but the chronic complications ofto the control group. This paradoxical effect has been explained by adelay in immune adaptive response to the virus provoked by CQadministration that could nullify the antiviral activity showed in vitro[8].however preliminary studies show differences with respect to SARSpathogenesis: in particular, it has been detected an initial increasedsecretion of T helper (TH)-2 cytokines (IL4, IL10) which suppressinflammation [9] and that could balance the TH-1 cell iper-responsewhich is supposed to lead to ARDS in patients affected by SARS [4].ow26Mhas been successfully treated by CQ/HCQ in human [7]the immune effect provoked by CQ/HCQ administration inConflict of interest: NoneD26of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of[2] De Wilde A.H, Jochmans D, Posthuma C.C, et al.
