Incidence of new cases andcorresponding mortalities have beenescalating daily.The current 2019-nCoV publichealth emergency can take lessonsfrom El-Kafrawy and colleagues\u2019 timelystudy. First, coronaviruses originatedin animals before transferring tohumans. El-Kafrawy and colleaguesfound that MERS-CoV was presentin 22\u00b78% of the camels sampled,indicating a high prevalence and evenan occupational hazard for peoplewho work with them. For example,camel shepherds are more likely to beinfected. The authors further foundthat MERS-CoV presence was higheramong local camels in Saudi Arabiathan imported camels from Africantrade ports.1 For 2019-nCoV, batsare the likely origin, based onsequencing evidence of samplesin early patients who developedpneumonia, where researchers foundan 85% identity with a previouslypublished genome of batSARSlike coronovirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45,MG772933.1). The clade of 2019-nCoVis within the subgenus Sarbecovirus,Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.2 How2019-nCoV arrived in Wuhan iscurrently undetermined, but recentevidence shows 27 (66%) of 41 initialinfected patients had direct exposureto Huanan seafood market.3 Publichealth officials should investigatewhether other coronaviruses existwhere 2019-nCoV is likely to haveoriginated so as to prevent futureepidemics, especially if infection is anoccupational hazard.Second, Saudi Arabian scientistsconfirmed that MERS-CoV is capableof human-to-human transmission.2019-nCoV is also capable ofhumanto-human transmission, based onevidence of a Shenzhen-based familywho visited infected family membersin Wuhan and subsequently developedsymptoms of acute respiratory diseasesyndrome, including shortnessof breath, fever, weakness, anddiarrhoea.4 This is most troublinggiven the time of year\u2014the SpringFestival celebration, which sees a lotof movement to and around China,with people rushing home to celebrateand subsequently returning to theirusual place or country of residence.Compared with containment of theSARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, Chinanow has a far greater transportationcapacity. The basic reproductionnumber of 2019-nCoV is evolvingquickly, with estimates in mid-Januaryof each case infecting 2\u00b76 other people(uncertainty range 1\u00b75\u20133\u00b75).5Stopping the disease will be bestachieved by prevention at the source.Like John Snow, who removedthe handle of the water pump onBroad Street following the choleraoutbreak in London, public healthofficials need to find the key leverat the sources of disease through agreater understanding of the enzooticpatterns.I served as the Asia Editor of The Lancet in 2017.", "ref_list": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "In The Lancet Planetary Health,\nSherif El-Kafrawy and colleagues did\nan enzootic genomic study in camels\nto analyse the genetic diversity,\ngeographical origin, and infection\nprevalence of Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus\n(MERSCoV).1 Not long after the Article\u2019s\npublication in December, 2019, the\n2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\nwas found in China, with patient\nzero suspected to have originated in\nWuhan.
