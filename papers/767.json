Drug repositioningrepresents the only feasible option to address this global challenge and a panel of fiftyFDAapproved drugs that have been pre-selected by an assay of SARS-CoV was screened to identifypotential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a total of 24 drugswhich exhibited antiviral efficacy (0.1 \u00b5M < IC50 < 10 \u00b5M) against SARS-CoV-2. In particular,two FDA-approved drugs - niclosamide and ciclesonide \u2013 were notable in some respects. Thesedrugs will be tested in an appropriate animal model for their antiviral activities. In near future,these already FDA-approved drugs could be further developed following clinical trials in orderto provide additional therapeutic options for patients with COVID-19.COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 1.Although the case fatality rate due to this viral infection varies from 1 to 12% 2, the transmissionrate is relatively high 3 and recently, the WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.Currently, there is no vaccines or therapeutics available and the patients with COVID-19 arebeing treated with supportive care.Drug repositioning could be an effective strategy to respond immediately to emerging infectious4diseases since the new drug development usually takes more than 10 years . FDA-approveddrugs provide safe alternatives only in the case where at least modest antiviral activity can be5achieved. Accordingly, several drugs are being tested in numerous clinical trials includingremdesivir, lopinavir, and chloroquine 6.In this study, we screened a panel of FDA-approved drugs to identify antiviral drug candidatesfor the treatment of COVID-19 and suggest the identified drug candidates may be considered fortherapeutic development.We screened approximately 3,000 FDA- and IND-approved drug library against SARS-CoV toidentify antiviral drug candidates (manuscript in preparation). Since the SARS-CoV andSARSCoV-2 are very similar (79.5% sequence identity) 1, the drugs which show antiviral activityagainst SARS-CoV are expected to show similar extent of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.A total of 35 drugs were selected from the earlier SARS-CoV screening results. In addition,fifteen drugs were included based on recommendations from infectious diseases specialists(Table 1). For screening experiments, Vero cells were used and each drug was added to the cellsprior to the virus infection. At 24 h after the infection, the infected cells were scored byimmunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for the viral N protein of SARS-CoV-2.The confocal microscope images of both viral N protein and cell nuclei were analyzed using ourin-house Image Mining (IM) software and the dose-response curve (DRC) for each drug wasgenerated (Figure 1).Chloroquine, lopinavir, and remdesivir were used as reference drugs with IC50 values of 9.12,7.28, and 11.41 \u00b5M, respectively (Figure 1A). Among the 50 drugs that were evaluated in ourstudy, 24 drugs showed potential antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values inbetween 0.1 and 10 \u00b5 M; Tilorone, Cyclosporine, Loperamide, Mefloquine, Amodiaquine,Proscillaridin, Digitoxin, Digoxin, Hexachlorophene, Hydroxyprogesterone caproate,Salinomycin, Ouabain, Cepharanthine, Ciclesonide, Oxyclozanide, Anidulafungin, Gilteritinib,Berbamine, Tetrandrine, Abemaciclib, Ivacaftor, Bazedoxifene, Niclosamide, and Eltrombopag.Among these 24 drugs, two FDA-approved drugs drew our attention. First, niclosamide, anantihelminthic drug, exhibited very potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 = 0.28\u00b5 M). Not surprisingly, its broad-spectrum antiviral effect has been well documented in theliterature 7 including antiviral properties against SARS- and MERS-CoV 8,9. Recently, Gassen etal. demonstrated that niclosamide inhibits SKP2 activity, which enhances autophagy and reducesMERS-CoV replication 9. A similar mechanism might be attributable for the inhibition ofSARSCoV-2 infection by niclosamide. Although niclosamide suffers a pharmacokinetic flaw of lowadsorption, further development or drug formulation could enable an effective delivery of thisdrug to the target tissue 10.Second, ciclesonide is another interesting drug candidate for further development although itsantiviral potency was much lower (IC50 = 4.33 \u00b5M) than niclosamide. It is an inhaledcorticosteroid used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis 11. A recent report by Matsuyama et al.corroborated our finding of ciclesonide as a potential antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 12. Atreatment report of three patients who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Japan(https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200303_20/) warrants further clinical investigationof this drug in patients with COVID-19. Intriguingly, an underlying mechanism for thesuppression of viral infection by ciclesonide has been revealed by the isolation of a drug-resistantmutant 12. The isolation of the drug-resistant mutant indicated that NSP15, a viralriboendonuclease, is the molecular target of ciclesonide. Together, it is not unreasonable toconsider that ciclesonide exhibits a direct-acting antiviral activity in addition to its intrinsicantiinflammatory function. In the future, siRNA targeting the hormone receptor will allow to assessthe extent of direct-acting antiviral activity. With its proven anti-inflammatory activity,ciclesonide may represent as a potent drug which can manifest dual roles (antiviral andantiinflammatory) for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Prior to our evaluation of 50 drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection, we also tested antiviralactivity of several other drugs based on the cytopathic effect of the virus in the presence of eachdrug (Figure 2). In particular, the effect of favipiravir and atazanavir was compared to those ofthe reference drugs (chloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir) because favipiravir is considered as adrug candidate for clinical trials and atazanavir was recently predicted as the most potentantiviral drug by AI-inference modeling 13. However, in the current work, we did not observeany antiviral activity of either favipiravir or atazanavir.In summary, we selected and screened 50 FDA-approved drugs based on our SARS-CoVscreening and our screening campaign revealed 24 potential antiviral drug candidates againstSARS-CoV-2. Our findings could be further validated in an appropriate animal model, andhopefully developed through subsequent clinical trials in order to provide additional therapeuticoptions for patients with COVID-19.Vero cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL-81) andmaintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Welgene),supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1XAntibioticAntimycotic solution (Gibco).

(Burlingame, CA),respectively.Ten-point DRCs were generated for each drug. Vero cells were seeded at 1.2 \u00d7 104 cells per wellin DMEM, supplemented with 2% FBS and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (Gibco) in black,384-well, \u03bcClear plates (Greiner Bio-One), 24 h prior to the experiment. Ten-point DRCs weregenerated, with compound concentrations ranging from 0.05\u201350 \u03bcM. For viral infection, plateswere transferred into the BSL-3 containment facility and SARS-CoV-2 was added at amultiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0125. The cells were fixed at 24 hpi with 4% PFA andanalyzed by immunofluorescence. The acquired images were analyzed using in-house softwareto quantify cell numbers and infection ratios, and antiviral activity was normalized to positive(mock) and negative (0.5% DMSO) controls in each assay plate. DRCs were fitted by sigmoidaldose-response models, with the following equation: Y = Bottom + (Top Bottom)/(1 +(IC50/X)Hillslope), using XLfit 4 Software or Prism7. IC50 values were calculated from thenormalized activity dataset-fitted curves. All IC50 and CC50 values were measured in duplicate,and the quality of each assay was controlled by Z'-factor and the coefficient of variation inpercent (%CV).Ten-point DRCs were generated for each drug.
