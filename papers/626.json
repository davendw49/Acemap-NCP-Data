Rapid and precisediagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19,providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. A one-step reversetranscription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) coupled withnanoparticles-based biosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was successfullyestablished for rapidly and accurately diagnosing COVID-19. A simple equipment(such as heating block) was required for maintaining a constant temperature (63\u00b0C)for only 40 min. Using two designed LAMP primer sets, F1ab (opening reading frame1a/b) and np (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplifiedand detected in a 'one-step' and 'single-tube' reaction, and the detection results wereeasily interpreted by NBS. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12copies (each of detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generatedfrom non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients,the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33) in the oropharynx swabsamples, and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96) when analyzed the clinicalsamples collected from non-COVID-19 patients. The total diagnosis test from samplecollection to result interpretation only takes approximately 1 h. In sum, theRT-LAMP-NBS is a promising tool for diagnosing the current SARS-CoV-2infection in first line field, public health and clinical laboratories, especially forresource-challenged regions.loop-mediated isothermal amplification; Biosensor.5455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182        In late Decembe        Diagnosis of COVID-19 based on clinical symptoms, especially in the earlystages of this disease, is extremely difficult as there are no characteristic initialmanifestations of COVID-19 (4). Although genome sequencing had high accuracy fordiagnose of COVID-19, it was not applicable in rapid diagnosis for clinicallarge-samples because of its longer sequencing time and high requirements forexperimental equipment (5). In the current outbreak of COVID-19, real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was employed to detectSARS-CoV-2 in public health and clinical laboratories because it a specific andsensitive diagnostic method for detection the novel coronavirus (6). However,rRT-PCR technique strongly relies on complex apparatus, skilled personnel and astable power supply, the total run time of rRT-PCR test is several hours from theclinical specimens to result reporting. In particular, some regions where outbreaks ofCOVID-19 emerge usually do not provide sufficient infrastructure for good rRT-PCRdiagnostic services, especially for field laboratories and resource-limited settings (7).Hence, there is an urgent requirement for easy-to-use, more rapid and simplerdetection techniques for diagnosis of COVID-19.Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which is the most popularisothermal amplification assay, is able to offer a diagnostic testing option for thisscenario (8). The details of LAMP mechanism have been described by previouspublications (9). Using the LAMP-based protocols, nucleic acid amplification isconducted under isothermal conditions (e.g., in a heating block) with high efficiency,specificity and speed, eliminating the use of precision thermal cycler for thermalchange (9, 10). The LAMP technique is highly specific, because recognition of targetsequence by six or eight independent regions is required (11). Thus far, LAMPcombined with reverse transcription assay (RT-LAMP) had been developed for thedetection of multiple respiratory RNA viruses (e.g., influenza viruses, middle eastrespiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) (12).Regarding these traits of LAMP technique, development of a LAMP-based assay fordiagnosis of COVID-19 can overcome the shortcomings posed by rRT-PCR methods,and facilitates rapid diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19.Up to now, two informal published LAMP assays have been developed fordiagnosis of COVID-19, and preliminarily evaluated using clinical or stimulatedrespiratory samples (13, 14). Unfortunately, only a genetic sequence (Open readingframe 1a/b; F1ab) was amplified and detected in the two systems, an unreliablediagnosis result may be obtained when the two COVID-19 LAMP assays detected asample with high homology sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., bat severe acuterespiratory syndrome-like coronavirus, GenBank KY417152.1). Traditionalmonitoring techniques (e.g., agarose gel electrophoresis, SYBR dyes and PHindicator), which were non-specific for COVID-19 LAMP products, were employedfor confirming the two COVID-19 LAMP results. In addition, the electrophoresis is atime-consuming and tedious procedure, and the judgment of color change of reactionvessel by unaided eye is potentially subjective. Therefore, there is a continuouscommand for devising the new LAMP-based assays, which are capable ofsimultaneously detecting multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2, providing more rapid andobjective result, and facilitating simpler diagnosis.Here, a 'one-step' and 'one-tube' RT-LAMP coupled with nanoparticles-basedbiosensor (NBS) assay (RT-LAMP-NBS) was developed for diagnosis of COVID-19114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142(Figure 1 and 2). Two target sequences, including F1ab and nucleoprotein gene (np),were simultaneously amplified in an isothermal reaction, and detected in a test step.We will expound the basic COVID-19 RT-LAMP principle, optimize the reactionparameters (e.g., amplification temperature), and demonstrate its feasibility.In the LAMP system (Figure 1), FIP (forward inner primer) initiates the isothermalamplification, and the new strand derived from FIP primer was displaced by the F3(forward primer) synthesis (Step 1). Then, 2 primers, including BIP (backward innerprime) and B3 (backward primer), annealed to the newly produced strand (Step 2),and displacement enzyme (Bst 2.0) extended in tandem generating a dumb-bell formproduct (Step 3). Thus, the stem-loop stem product can server as the template for thesecond stage of the LAMP reaction (exponential amplification). The LB* primer(backward loop primer), which was labeled with biotin at the 5' end, could anneal to adistinct product derived from the exponential LAMP reaction stage (Step 4). The LB*product also severed as the template for next amplification by LF* (forward loopprimer), which was modified at the 5' end with hapten (Step 5). As a result, adouble-labeled detectable product (LF*/LB* product) was formed, and one end of theLF*/LB* product was labeled with hapten, and the other end with biotin (Step 6, 7).One hapten is assigned to one primer set, which provide the possibility for multiplexA representative schematic of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay were displayedin Figure 2. In the COVID-19 RT-LAMP system, fluorescein (FITC) was assigned toF1ab primer set, and digoxigenin (Dig) for np primer set. Hence, F1ab-LF* andF1ab-LB* primers were labeled at the 5' end with FITC and biotin, and np-LF* andnp-LB* for Dig and biotin, respectively (Figure 2A). With the assistance of AMV(avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase), the RNA (SARS-CoV-2 template)was converted to cDNA, which acted as the material for subsequent LAMPamplification (Figure 2B). After 40 min at 63\u00b0C, F1ab-LAMP products weresimultaneously labeled with FITC and biotin, and np-LAMP products for Dig andbiotin (Figure 2C).As shown in the Figure 3, the result readout of COVID-19 RT-LAMP assay wasexhibited using the NBS. The details of NBS was shown Figure 3A (Seen in'Materials and Method' section). For visualization of COVID-19 RT-LAMP resultsusing NBS, aliquots (0.5 \u00b5l) of reaction mixtures were deposited into the sampleregion (Figure 3B, step 1), and an aliquot (80 \u00b5l) running buffer then was depositedon the same region (Figure 3B, step 2). At the detection stage, running buffer movesalong NBS through capillary action, and rehydrates the SA-DNPS immobilized in theconjugate pad. The end of F1ab-RT-LAMP products labeled with FITC was capturedby the anti-FITC antibody located in TL1 region (Test line 1), and the end ofnp-RT-LAMP products with Dig was captured by anti-Dig antibody located in TL2region (Test line 2). The other ends of F1ab- and np-RT-LAMP products, labeled withbiotin, bind streptavidin-conjugated color nanoparticles for visualization (Figure 3B,step 3). The excess streptavidin-conjugated color nanoparticles were captured bybiotinylated bovine serum albumin immobilized in CL (Control line), whichdemonstrated the working condition of NBS (Figure 3B, step 3). The interpretation ofthe COVID-19 RT-LAMP results using NBS was shown in Figure 3C.The positive vessels of F1ab-, np- and COVID-19 RT-MCDA assay were visualizedas light green using VDR (Visual detection reagent), while the reaction tubes ofnegative and blank controls remained colorlessness (Figure S1, top row). Using NBS,TL1 and CL were observed on the detection region for positive F1ab-RT-LAMPresults, and TL2 and CL for positive np-RT-LAMP results. TL1, TL2 and CLsimultaneously appeared on the detection region of NBS for positive COVID-19RT-LAMP results. Only CL appeared on the analysis area of NBS for negative andblank controls of F1ab-, np- and COVID-19 RT-LAMP results (Figure S1, bottomrow). These results indicated that F1ab- and np-LAMP primer sets were available forestablish the COVID-19 RT-LAMP NBS assay for rapid and reliable detection ofSARS-CoV-2. The parameter of optimal temperature for COVID-19 RT-LAMPtechnique also was tested, and reaction temperature of 63\u00b0C was used for performingthe COVID-19 RT-LAMP amplification (Figure S2 and S3).The COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS was able to detect down 12 copies (each ofF1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid) (Figure 4). Two target genes were detected andidentified in a one-tube reaction (Figure 4A). The COVID-19 RT-LAMP resultsusing NBS were in consistent with turbidity and VDR detection (Figure 4B and 4C),while traditional monitoring techniques (VDR and turbidity) could not facilitatemultiplex analysis. Furthermore, the sensitivity of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assaywas in conformity with F1ab- and np-RT-LAMP assay (Figure 4, S4 and S5).The optimal duration time of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay at the isothermalstage also was determined, and the template level at the detection limit appeared threered lines (TL1, TL2 and CL) when the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out only 30min at 63\u00b0C (Figure S6). For the RNA template detection, a reverse transcriptionprocess (10 min) is essential, thus a COVID-19 RT-LAMP reaction time of 40 minwas recommended for detection of clinical samples. Therefore, the whole diagnosisprocess of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS, including sample collection (3 min), rapidRNA extraction (15 min), RT-LAMP reaction (40 min) and result interpretation (<2min), was finished approximately 1 h (Figure 5).The positive COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS results were obtained only from positivecontrols (120 copies each of F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid) (Table S1). The negativeresults were observed in all pathogens of non-SARS-CoV-2 (virus, bacteria and fungi),in which only a red band (CL) was observed in the biosensor detection regions,indicating no cross-reaction with non-SARS-CoV-2 templates (Table S2).204205206207208209210211212213214215216217218219220221222223224225226227228229230231232        Of the total of 129 respiratory samples, which were initially analyzed using rRT-PCRin Sanya Peop                An ongoing epidemic by SARS-CoV-2, sta        Here, we reported a novel LAMP-based test for simple, rapid and reliablediagnosis of COVID-19, name COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS. Our assay mergedLAMPamplification,reversetranscription,multiplexanalysiswithnanoparticles-based biosensor, and facilitated the diagnosis of COVID-19 in aone-step, single-tube reaction. Only simple apparatus (e.g., a water bath or a heatingblock) were need to maintain a constant temperature (63\u00b0C) for 40 min. Comparedwith the developed COVID-19 RT-LAMP assays, the RT-LAMP results in this reportwere visually and objectively indicated by NBS, which was a simple and easy-to-useplatform, avoiding the requirement of complex process (e.g., electrophoresis), special234235236237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251252253254255256257258259260261262reagents (e.g., PH indicator) and expensive instrument (e.g., real-time turbidity) (13,14). Total analysis procedure could be complete approximately 1 h, including samplecollection (3 min), rapid RNA extraction (15 min), RT-LAMP reaction (40 min) andresult interpretation (< 2 min). Considering these traits, COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBSassay is a rapid, economical and technically simple method, offering a measure ofpracticality for field and clinical laboratories, especially for resource-challengedsettings.Two RT-LAMP primer sets, including F1ab-RT-LAMP and np-RT-LAMPprimer sets, were specifically designed recognizing eight regions of target genes(Figure 6), guaranteeing the high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The data ofanalytical specificity revealed that no false-positive results were produced fromnon-SARS-CoV-2 templates, and positive results were obtained from positive controland SARS-CoV-2 templates (Table S1). Moreover, two targets (F1ab and np genes)could be simultaneously amplified and detected in a 'one-step' RT-LAMP reaction,which further guaranteed the assay's reliability. Thus, our approach could effectivelyavoid the undesired results yielded from the developed COVID-19 RT-LAMP assaysthat only amplified and detected a target gene (e.g., F1ab) (13, 14).The data of analytical sensitivity validated that RT-LAMP-NBS assay issufficiently sensitive for diagnosis of COVID-19. Us this protocol, detection limit ofCOVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS was 12 copies each of F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid,which is in conformity with assay's sensitivity generated from F1ab-RT-LAMP-NBSand N-RT-LAMP-NBS detection (Figure 4, S4 and S5). The COVID-19RT-LAMP-NBS assay did not improve or decrease the analytical sensitivity whencompared with the signlex analysis (F1ab-RT-LAMP and np-RT-LAMP assays). Inthis report, we did not compare the sensitivity results obtained from COVID-19RT-LAMP-NBS with rRT-PCR assay, because the quality of commercially availabletest kits for SARS-CoV-2 detection remains uneven. These commercial rRT-PCRassays used in Sanya People's Hospital produce uninform results when they wereapplied to analyze the 10-fold diluted plasmid templates. For detection the RNAtemplates extracted from respiratory samples, 100% (33/33) of clinical samplesexamined by rRT-PCR exhibited completely consistent diagnosis, and analyticalspecificity was also 100% (96/96) for COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS when analyzingthe RNA templates from non-SARS-CoV-2 infection patients.The one-step single-tube COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay devised in this reportoffers an attractive diagnosis tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The nearlyequipment-free platform of COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS makes it applicable forresource-limited laboratories (e.g., field laboratories), and the diagnosis results areeasy to interpret. The high specificity, sensitivity and feasibility of COVID-19RT-LAMP-NBS assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, and its low cost and ease of usemake the target assay a valuable diagnosis tool for use in field, clinic, public heathand primary care laboratories, especially for resource-poor regions.As shown in Figure 3A, NBS contains four components (a sample pad, a conjugatepad, a nitrocellulose membrane and an absorbent pad) (Jie-Yi Biotechnology). Rabbitanti-fluorescein antibody (anti-FITC, 0.2 mg/ml, Abcam. Co., Ltd.), sheepanti-digoxigenin antibody (Anti-Dig, 0.25 mg/mL, Abcam. Co., Ltd.) and biotinylatedbovine serum albumin (biotin-BSA, 4 mg/mL, Abcam. Co., Ltd.) were immobilized atdetection regions (nitrocellulose membrane, NC) as the test line 1 (TL1), test line 2(TL2) and control line (CL), respectively, with each line separated by 5 mm. Dyestreptavidin coated polymer nanoparticles (SA-DNPs, 129 nm, 10mg mL-1, 100mMborate, pH 8.5 with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 and 10mM EDTA) wereimmobilized at the conjugated regions. Thus, the NBS devised here can detect threetargets (a chromatography control and two target amplicons). The assembled NBSwere cut into 4-mm dipsticks, and dryly stored at the room temperature until use.Two RT-LAMP primer sets (F1ab-RT-LAMP and np-RT-LAMP) were designedaccording the LAMP mechanism using a specialized software (PrimerExplore V5),which targeted F1ab and np gene of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank MN908947,Wuhan-Hu-1) (Figure 6). Then, a Blast analysis of the GenBank nucleotide databasewas performed for the F1ab- and np-LAMP primers to validate sequence specificity.The more details of primer design, locations, sequences and modifications wereshown in Figure 6 and Table S2. All of the oligomers were synthesized and purifiedby RuiBo Biotech. Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) at HPLC purification grade.The conventional RT-LAMP (F1ab- and np-RT-LAMP) was carried out in a one-stepreaction in a 25-\u00b5l mixture containing 12.5 \u00b5l 2\u00d7isothermal reaction buffer [40 mMTris-HCl (pH 8.8), 40 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 M betaine and0.2 % Tween-20], 8 U of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 5 U of theavian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 1.4 mM dATP, 1.4 mMdCTP, 1.4 mM dGTP, 1.4 mM dTTP, 0.4 \u00b5M each of F3 and B3, 0.4 \u00b5M each of LF,LF*, LB and LB*, 1.6 \u00b5M each of FIP and BIP and template (1\u00b5l for the standardplasmid).The COVID-19 RT-LAMP was also performed in a one-step reaction in a 25-\u00b5lmixture containing 12.5 \u00b5l 2\u00d7isothermal reaction buffer [40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8),40 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 M betaine and 0.2 % Tween-20],8 U of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 5 U of the avianmyeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 1.4 mM dATP, 1.4 mM dCTP,1.4 mM dGTP, 1.4 mM dTTP, 0.25 \u00b5M each of F1ab-F3 and F1ab-B3, 0.25 \u00b5M eachof F1ab-LF, F1ab-LF*, F1ab-LB and F1ab-LB*, 1.0 \u00b5M each of F1ab-FIP andF1ab-BIP, 0.15 \u00b5M each of np-F3 and np-B3, 0.15 \u00b5M each of np-LF, np-LF*, np-LBand np-LB*, 0.6 \u00b5M each of np-FIP and np-BIP and template (1\u00b5l for the eachstandard plasmid, 5\u00b5l for samples).The monitoring techniques, including real-time turbidity (LA-320C), visualdetection reagents (VDR) and NBS, were employed for confirming the RT-LAMP324325326327328329330331332333334335336337338339340341342343344345346347reactions and optimizing the reaction parameters (e.g., reaction temperature andisothermal time).plasmids (F1ab-plasmid andnp-plasmid)were commerciallyconstructed by Tianyi-Huiyuan Biotech. Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China), which contain theF1ab and np sequences, respectively. Ten-fold serial dilutions (1.2\u00d7104 to 1.2\u00d710-2copies) of F1ab-plasmid and np-plasmid were used to evaluate assay's sensitivity. Theplasmid concentration at detection limit level was employed for testing the durationtime required by COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay.The specificity of the COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS assay was examined by detectingthe templates extracted from various pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and fungi(Table S1).Respiratory samples were collected from COVID-19 infection patients in SanYaPeople's Hospital, Hainan, which were defined according to standard diagnosis andtreatment criteria of COVID-19 (Trial Version 6). The RNA templates extracted fromrespiratory samples were used after clinical and laboratory diagnosis, which wasconducted using the RT-qPCR kit (Recommended by the China CDC). Collection ofthese RNA templates and analysis of them were approved by SanYa People's Hospital.5 \u00b5l RNA was used as templates for preforming the COVID-19 RT-LAMP-NBS test.Contributors: Yi Wang and Xiong Zhu conceived and designed this study.

Rapid and precisediagnostic methods are thus immediately needed for diagnosing COVID-19,providing timely treatment and facilitating infection control. The details of LAMP mechanism have been described by previouspublications (9). Using the LAMP-based protocols, nucleic acid amplification isconducted under isothermal conditions (e.g., in a heating block) with high efficiency,specificity and speed, eliminating the use of precision thermal cycler for thermalchange (9, 10). Unfortunately, only a genetic sequence (Open readingframe 1a/b; F1ab) was amplified and detected in the two systems, an unreliablediagnosis result may be obtained when the two COVID-19 LAMP assays detected asample with high homology sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., bat severe acuterespiratory syndrome-like coronavirus, GenBank KY417152.1). The LB*product also severed as the template for next amplification by LF* (forward loopprimer), which was modified at the 5' end with hapten (Step 5). The details of NBS was shown Figure 3A (Seen in'Materials and Method' section). The interpretation ofthe COVID-19 RT-LAMP results using NBS was shown in Figure 3C.The positive vessels of F1ab-, np- and COVID-19 RT-MCDA assay were visualizedas light green using VDR (Visual detection reagent), while the reaction tubes ofnegative and blank controls remained colorlessness (Figure S1, top row). Only CL appeared on the analysis area of NBS for negative andblank controls of F1ab-, np- and COVID-19 RT-LAMP results (Figure S1, bottomrow). For the RNA template detection, a reverse transcriptionprocess (10 min) is essential, thus a COVID-19 RT-LAMP reaction time of 40 minwas recommended for detection of clinical samples.
