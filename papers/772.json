No. 52904/52906) needed for the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) RT-qPCR assay to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection [4]. To address thisproblem, we tested i) whether alternative Qiagen RNA extraction kits (RNeasy Mini, Cat. No.74104/74106 or RNeasy Micro, Cat. No. 74004) could be substituted for the Viral RNA Mini kitand ii) whether the need for RNA extraction could be eliminated altogether by simply addingnasopharyngeal patient sample directly into the RT-qPCR assay.        detection by RT-qPCR. To validate and compare the performance of each viral RNA extractionkit, we first conducted a spiking experiment. A standard quantity of 5x104 copies of purifiedSARS-CoV-        Next, to assess the efficiency of RNA extraction from a nasopharyngeal swab (NP) sampleby each type of extraction kit, we obtained NP swabs from two COVID-19 patients who had beenpreviously verified for SARS-CoV-2 infection by the Vermont Department of Health using theCDC RT-qPCR test (data not shown). Both patient samples, which were originally collected asnasopharyngeal swabs in a volume of 2 mL of M6 viral transport media (termed diluent hereafter),were pooled (equi-volume) due to the small volumes remaining after clinical testing. Followingthe standard CDC protocol, 140 \u00b5L of the pooled patient sample was used for RNA extractionwith the Viral RNA Mini kit and was detected as positive via RT-qPCR with a CT of 18.7 (Figure2). The patient sample inputs for both RNeasy kits was 100 \u00b5L and RNA recovered by the RNeasyMini and RNeasy Micro were detected at CT values of 21.0 and 20.1, respectively. Forcomparison, we also ran duplicate samples of lower quantities of the CDC positive controlsynthetic RNA extracted with the Viral RNA Mini kit. For 5\uf0b4104 copies, positivity was determinedat an average CT of 28; for 5\uf0b4103 copies positivity was achieved at an average CT of 31.9, and for5\uf0b4102 copies positivity was found at an average CT of 35.0 (Figure 2). All extraction methods(Viral RNA Mini, RNeasy Micro, and RNeasy Mini kits) yielded successful detection ofSARSCoV-2 RNA in the control patient sample that was well above the CT limit of detection requiredby the CDC test. Thus, this demonstrates that alternative viral RNA extraction kits can be used fordetection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR.extraction step. We next tested whether the RNA extraction step could be omitted by adding thepooled COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal swab diluent directly to the RT-qPCR reaction. Todetermine whether heating the nasopharyngeal swab diluent before RT-qPCR might improveaccessibility of viral RNA to the RT enzyme, we used swab diluent that had either been heated ornot for five minutes at 70\u00b0C prior the RT-qPCR reaction. As shown in Figure 3, SARS-CoV-2RNA was successfully detected in the absence of an RNA extraction step and preheating thenasopharyngeal swab diluent had no impact on viral RNA detection (average CT positivity in bothcases was 23). Compared to the same pooled nasopharyngeal swab diluent extracted with theQIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, adding the nasopharyngeal swab diluent directly into the RT-qPCRreaction resulted in an ~30-fold drop in sensitivity (Figure 3). However the equivalent amount ofthe original sample analyzed was 60% that of the extracted RNA. Thus, the drop in sensitivity wasactually ~18 fold. As controls, Figure 3 also shows the CTs where known quantities of the CDCpositive control synthetic RNA extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit were detected. Thepooled nasopharyngeal patient sample was detected much earlier (CT of 23) compared to the topspiked control of 4x103 copies of purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA (CT of 28). These resultsdemonstrate that successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from patient NP sample by RT-qPCRcan be done in the absence of an RNA extraction step.All three Qiagen RNA extraction kits yield sufficient SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a patient NPsample for successful RT-qPCR detection. The Viral RNA Mini kit performs slightly better thanthe other two kits (~four-fold better RT-qPCR signal when used on the pooled patient sample),while the RNeasy Mini and RNeasy Micro kits perform similarly to each other. Importantly, ourresults suggest that it is possible to skip the RNA extraction step entirely and still detectSARSCoV-2 RNA from a patient nasopharyngeal swab sample. Each of the methods tested here (thethree RNA extraction kits or omission of the RT step) allowed detection of viral RNA in patientsamples at levels significantly higher than 4\uf0b4103 copies of the CDC positive control RNA and wellbefore the 40 cycle CT cutoff the CDC is recommending for positive sample identification.Further, the samples we obtained were swabs collected into 2 mL of transport medium. Thisvolume could be reduced to i) increase the resulting viral RNA copies present per \u00b5L of the sampleand enhance detection and ii) to spare the transport medium (another potential bottleneck).Sensitivity could also be increased by raising the volume of the RT-qPCR reaction toaccommodate more patient input material. It should be noted that these results are preliminary andrepresent data from only one pooled patient sample due to extremely limited reagents (patientsample volume, primers, one-step master mix). They should thus be interpreted with caution, aswe currently have no data on whether the viral RNA quantity present in the pooled NP sampleused here is broadly representative of levels seen across the spectrum of COVID-19 patients.Replicates of these experiments in a greater number of patient samples will be ongoing in ourlaboratories, and results will be published as soon as they are available.1. The three Qiagen kits (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini (Qiagen, Cat. No. 52904/52906); RNeasyMini kit (Cat. No. 74104/74106); or RNeasy Micro (Cat. No. 74004)) were used accordingto the manufacturer\u2019s instructions with the following modifications.a. As the RNeasy Mini kit does not include carrier RNA, 120 ng/reaction of the carrierRNA (Qiagen Cat. No. 1017647 if purchased separately) from the RNeasy microkit was added to the RNeasy Mini kit in order to increase yield (i.e. helpprecipitate/isolate the targeted viral RNA). This amount of carrier RNA iscalculated based on the amount used in the RNeasy Micro kit and adjusted for theincreased column surface area.b. The RNeasy Mini and RNeasy Micro kits are designed for use on cell pellets andpurification of RNA. As a liquid sample (nasopharyngeal swab diluent) was beinglysed (rather than a cell pellet) no QIAshredder (cell homogenization) step wasused. 100 \u00b5L of liquid sample was instead added directly to the RLT lysis buffercontaining 2-Mercaptoethanol (10uL/1000uL of RLT).c. Sample input, elution volumes, and concentrations of carrier RNA per reaction areprovided (Table 1). Additionally, for synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA spikingexperiments, the quantities of RNA used are described in text.2. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 2 COVID-19 confirmed patients were collected in a2 mL volume of M6 transport media. For this study, limited quantities of this material wereavailable so we pooled equal amounts of each sample for our assays. Sample manipulations(mixing with viral RNA extraction lysis buffer or direct addition to RT-qPCR plates) weredone in a Class II Biosafety Cabinet using BSL-2 precautions. For the viral RNA extractionkits, nasopharyngeal swab diluent was added directly to the lysis buffer for each kit,vortexed, and incubated for 10 minutes to allow for complete viral inactivation. For direct(no viral RNA extraction) RT-qPCR, the master mix was prepared and pipetted into theRT-qPCR plate followed by 7 \u00b5l of the pooled patient sample (or as a negative control theM6 viral transport media). The plate was sealed inside the biosafety cabinet and thenremoved for RT-qPCR.3. 5 \u00b5L of extracted RNA (from the final eluted material at the end of the viral RNA extractionfor each kit) or 7 \u00b5l of nasopharyngeal swab diluent was used as input material for the NewEngland Biolabs Luna Universal Probe One Step RT qPCR kit (cat #E3006S, lot#10066679) according to the IDT recommendation for primers/probe (1.5 \u00b5L primer/probeper reaction) using primer set N3- lot #0000499772 for IDT\u2019s Research Use Only kit forthe 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay.
