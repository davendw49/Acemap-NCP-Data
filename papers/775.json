Recent outbreak of novel coronavirus infected and killed thousands of people in the world. Rapid methods in finding peptides or antibody sequences that can inhibit the viral epitopes of COVID-19 will save the life of thousands. In this paper, we devised a machine learning (ML) model to predict the possible inhibitory synthetic antibodies for Corona virus. We collected 1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response and trained an ML model to predict the antibody response. Using graph featurization with variety of ML methods, we screened thousands of hypothetical antibody sequences and found 8 stable antibodies that potentially inhibit COVID-19. We combined bioinformatics, structural biology, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to verify the stability of the candidate antibodies that can inhibit the", "text": "Structural BiologyThe biomolecular process for recognition and neutralization of viral particles is through the processof viral antigen presentation and recruitment of appropriate B cells to synthesize the neutralizingantibodies.1 Theoretically, this process allows the immune system to stop any viral invasion, but thisresponse is slow and often requires days, even weeks before adequate immune response can beachieved.2,3 This poses a challenging question: Can the process of antibody discovery be acceleratedto counter highly infective viral diseases?With the rapid expansion of available biological data, such as DNA/protein sequences and structures4,it is now possible to model and predict the complex biological phenomena through machine learning(ML) approaches. Given sufficient training data, ML can be used to learn a mapping between theviral epitope and effectiveness of its complementary antibody.5 Once such mapping is learnt, it canbe used to predict potentially neutralizing antibody for a given viral sequence6.ML can essentially learn the complex antigen-antibody interactions faster than human immunesystem, leading to the generation of synthetic inhibitory antibodies acting as a bridge, which canovercome the latency between viral infection and human immune system response. This bridge canpotentially save the life of many especially during an outbreak and pandemic. One such instance isthe spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)7.With incredibly high infectivity and mortality rate, COVID-19 has become a global scare.8,9 Tocompound the problem, there are no proven therapeutics to aid the suffering patients2,8,10\u201314. Onlyviable treatment at the moment is symptomatic and there is a desperate need for developingtherapeutics to counter COVID-19. Recently, the proteomics sequences of \u2018WH-Human 1\u2019coronavirus became available through Metagenomic RNA sequencing of a patient in Wuhan.4,15WHHuman 1 is 89.1% similar to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses.4 With this sequence available, itis possible to find potential inhibitory antibodies by scanning thousands of antibody sequences anddiscovering the neutralizing ones16\u201318. However, this requires very expensive and time-consumingexperimentation to discover the inhibitory responses to Corona virus in a timely manner. In addition,computational and physics-based models require the bound crystal structure of antibody-antigencomplex, however; only a few of these structures have become available.19,20,21,22 In the case ofCOVID-19, the bound antigen-antibody crystal structure is not available to-date23,24. Given thischallenge and the fact that ML models require a large amount of data, the ML approach should relyon the sequences of the antibody-antigen rather than the crystal structures25.In this paper, we have collected a dataset comprised of antibody-antigen sequences of variety ofviruses including HIV, Influenza, Dengue, SARS, Ebola, Hepatitis, etc. with their patientclinical/biochemical IC50 data. Using this dataset (we call it VirusNet), we trained and benchmarkeddifferent shallow and deep ML models and selected the best performing model. Based on SARS 2006neutralizing antibody scaffold26, we created thousands of potential antibody candidates by mutationand screened them with our best performing ML model. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD)simulations were performed on the neutralizing candidates to check their structural stability. Wepredict 8 structures that were stable over the course of simulation and are potential neutralizingantibodies for COVID-19.In addition, we interpreted the ML method to understand what alterations in the sequence of bindingregion of the antibody would most effectively counter the viral mutation(s) and restore the ability ofthe antibody to bind to the virus27. This information is critical in terms of antibody design andengineering and reducing the dimension of combinatoric mutations needed to find a neutralizingantibody.MethodsThe majority of the data in the training set is composed of HIV antibody-antigen complex (1887samples). Most of the samples for the HIV training set were obtained from the Compile, Analyzeand Tally NAb panels (CATNAP) database from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)28,29. From CATNAP, data was collected for monoclonal antibodies, 2F5, 4E10 and 10E8, whichbind with GP4130\u201332. Using CATNAP\u2019s functionality for identifying epitope alignment, we selectedFASTA sequence of the antigen corresponding to the site of alignment, in the antibody. Wegenerated a dataset with 1831 training examples comprising of antibodies \u2013 antigen sequences andtheir corresponding IC50 values. The CATNAP output is comprised of site of antigen sequencealignment for each of the antibodies with respect to 2F5, 4E10 and 10E8. Using the co-crystalizedstructure of (2F5-ELDKWAS) in (PDB:1TJG)30 as template, the antibody fragment that comes incontact with the antigen was found by considering amino acids within 7\u00c5 of the antigen in thecocrystallized structure.To make the dataset more diverse and train a more robust ML model, we included more availableantibody-antigen sequences and their neutralization potential. To do this, we compiled the sequencesof Influenza, Dengue, Ebola, SARS, Hepatitis, etc.26,33\u201386by searching the keywords of \u201cvirus,antibody\u201d on RCSB server87 and selected the neutralizing complex by reading their correspondingpublications. Furthermore, for each neutralizing complex, the contact residues at the interface ofantibody and antigen were selected. To select the antigen contact sequences, all amino acids within5\u00c5 of corresponding antibody were chosen. (Supporting Information) To select the antibody contactsequences, all amino acids within 5\u00c5 of the antigen were chosen. In total, 102 sequences ofantibody-antigen complexes were mined and added to the 1831 samples, resulting in total numberof 1933 training samples.For effective representation of molecular structure of amino acids, the individual atoms of aminoacids of antibody and antigen were treated as undirected graph, where the atoms are nodes and bondsare edges88. It has been shown that graph representation is better in transferring the chemistry andtopology of molecular structure compared to Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP)88,89. Weconstruct these molecular graphs using RDkit90. Embeddings are generated to encode relevantfeatures about the molecular graph91,92. These embeddings encode information like the type of atom,valency of an atom, hybridization state, aromaticity etc. First, each antibody and antigen wereencoded into separate embeddings and then concatenated into a single embedding for the entireantibody-antigen complex. We then apply mean pooling over the features for this concatenatedembedding to ensure dimensional consistency across the training data. The pooled information isthen passed to classifier algorithms like XGBoost93, Random Forest94, Multilayer perceptron,Support Vector Machine (SVM)95 and Logistic Regression which then predict whether the antibodyis capable of neutralizing the virus.In order to find potential antibody candidates for COVID-19, 2589 different mutant strains ofantibody sequences were generated based on the sequence of SARS neutralizing antibodies. Thereason we selected these antibodies as initial scaffolds is that the genome of COVID-19 4 is 79.8%identical to \u201cTor2\u201d isolate of SARS (Accession number: AY274119)96. Using 4 different antibodyvariants of SARS (PDB: 2GHW, 3BGF, 6NB6, 2DD8)26,76,81,86, point mutations were applied to allthe amino acids in the binding region of antibody. (see Supporting Information for COVID-19antigen and antibody interactions) To find out the binding region of these antibodies for sequencegeneration, all amino acids within 5\u00c5 of their respective antigen were chosen. To assess thebiological feasibility of these mutant sequences, we scored each mutation by using the BLOSUM62matrix97.To assess the stability of proposed antibody structures, we performed molecular dynamics (MD)simulations of each of antibody structure in a solvated environment98. The simulation of solvatedantibody was carried out using GROMACS-5.1.499\u2013101, and topologies for each antibody weregenerated according the GROMOS 54a7102 forcefield. The protein was centered in a box, extending1 nanometer from surface of the protein. This box was the solvated by the SPC216 model wateratoms, pre-equilibrated at 300K. The antibody system in general carried a net positive charge and itwas neutralized by the counter ions. Energy minimization was carried out using steepest descentalgorithm, while restraining the peptide backbone to remove the steric clashes in atoms andsubsequently optimize solvent molecule geometry. The cut-off distance criteria for this minimizationwere forces less than 100.0 kJ/mol/nm or number of steps exceeding 50,000. This minimized structurewas the sent to two rounds of equilibration at 300K. First, an NVT ensemble for 50 picoseconds anda 2-femtosecond time step. Leapfrog dynamics integrator was used with Verlet scheme, neighbor-listwas updated every 10 steps. All the ensembles were under Periodic Boundary Conditions andharmonic constraints were applied by the LINCS algorithm103; under this scheme the long-rangeelectrostatic interactions were computed by Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm104. Berendsenthermostat was used for temperature coupling and pressure coupling was done using theParrinelloRahman barostat105,106. The last round of NPT simulation ensures that the simulated system is atphysiological temperature and pressure. The system volume was free to change in the NPT ensemblebut in fact did not change significantly during the course of the simulation. Following the rounds ofequilibration, production run for the system was carried out in NPT and no constraints for a total of15 nanoseconds, under identical simulation parameters.The flowchart of COVID-19 antibody discovery using ML has four major steps (Figure 1): 1.Collecting data and curating the dataset for training set. 2. Featurization, embedding andbenchmarking ML models and selecting the best performing one. 3. Hypothetical antibody librarygeneration and ML screening for neutralization and 4. Checking the stability of proposed antibodies.This workflow enables the rapid screening of large space of potential antibodies to neutralizeCOVID19. In general, this workflow can be used for high throughput screening of antibodies for any type ofvirus by only knowing the sequences of antigen epitopes.To better understand the diversity and similarity of the sequences that were used in the training set,t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) of all different viruses were computed (Figure2a). t-SNE axes shows the directions of the maximum variance in the dataset, therefore, thedimensionality of the data can be reduced to lower dimensions (here two). HIV antigen shows themost variations on t-SNE components where viruses such as Influenza, Dengue and H1N1 are veryclose to each other. The neutralizing antibodies were also projected using t-SNE to show thevariations in the available neutralizing sequences. (Figure 2b) Unlike antigen variations, antibodysequences are much closer to the center of t-SNE with a few scattered ones. The comparison of Figure2a and Figure 2b shows that the neutralizing antibodies are not sequence-diverse compared to virusantigens. This difference demonstrates that a large space of potential antibodies can be screened andused for finding novel antibodies. The labels in the dataset are comprised of the neutralization paneldata, IC50 values for monoclonal antibodies and pseudo-typed viruses. (Figure 2c) The IC50 labelswere collected from 49 published neutralization studies and were collected from Los Alamos HIVDatabase (for 1831 samples in our training set).For some cases in CATNAP, personalcommunication with the authors were made to resolve sequence name ambiguities between differentlaboratories. For 102 samples of various viruses collected from RCSB server, all of them neutralizetheir antigen based on biochemical assays. These samples were labeled by setting their IC50 to zero.Since classification is performed on the training dataset, IC50 \u226410 are set to neutralizing and IC50>10to non-neutralizing (Figure 2c). To visualize the diversity of the virus types used in the dataset otherthan HIV, the distribution of 13 more viruses were presented in Figure 2d. Influenza, Dengue, SARS,Ebola and then Hepatitis have relatively larger samples in the dataset.To benchmark the performance of different ML models on the VirusNet dataset and select the bestperforming one, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Support VectorMachines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR) were used (Figure 3a). The five-fold cross validationon 80%-20% split, train, and test resulted in best accuracy for XG-Boost model. The performanceand ranking of models follow the order of XGBoost (90.57%)> RF (89.18%)>LR (81.17%)> MLP(78.23)> SVM (75.49%). Since the training data is sparse in the case of VirusNet (See Figure 2a andFigure 2b), XGBoost selects the sparse features input by pruning and learning the underlying sparsitypatterns. To test the robustness of the XGBoost on completely unseen virus types, for each left-outvirus type, the model was trained on all the sequences in the VirusNet except for the left-out. Forexample, for Influenza, all the sequences and labels of Influenza were removed from the training setand the trained model on the remaining dataset were tested on all the Influenzas\u2019s sequences andconsequently the classification accuracy were reported (Figure 3b). The accuracies for the out of classtest is as follows: Influenza (84.61%), Dengue (100%), Ebola (75%), Hepatitis (75%), SARS (100%).The out of class results demonstrate that our model is capable of generalizing the prediction to acompletely novel virus epitope. Since COVID-19 is completely a new virus, we can conclude thatour model prediction performance will be accurate. The fact that our model prediction is 100% forSARS out of class test demonstrate its capability of effectively predicting the antibodies forCOVID19 which is from SARS family.Next, using the best performing model (XGBoost), all the hypothetical candidates in the library wereevaluated for neutralization. Out of all the candidates, some of them are invalid mutations screenedusing BLOSUM62 matrix97 (Figure 3c). 18 final candidates are both valid mutations and canneutralize COVID-19 with high confidence probability of 0.9895 (shown with green color in FigureInterpretability of the ML models is very important in both explaining the underlying biological andchemical understanding of neutralization and providing design guidelines for antibody engineering.One of the significant advantages of ensemble methods such as XGBoost is their interpretability. Bytaking advantage of this property, the important features that are giving rise to neutralization wereranked and scored (Figure 3d). The input features to the model contains atomic level attributes suchas atom type, valency, hybridization, etc. To collectively translate the important atomic features intoimportant amino acid features, the scores of amino acids with unique atomic features were summedup and ranked (Figure 3d). Some of the atomic features were common among all the amino acids(e.g. Carbon, implicit valency, Oxygen, etc.) therefore; we ignored them. However, some of the otherfeatures like aromaticity or having Sulfur are unique and we considered those in amino acid features.Based on the unique features appeared in ranking, Methionine (M) is the most important one. (FigureThe predicted sequences from the ML model were then used to model the novel structure ofpotentially neutralizing antibodies. The predicted sequences were projected onto their progenitorantibody and the changes in amino acid sequence were modelled as follows: Simple point mutationswere introduced by modifying the target amino acid using Coot 107,108(CrystallographicObjectOriented Toolkit). Coot environment allowed us to predict the stereochemical effect of each pointmutation and appropriately compensate for it. Using such an approach, we were able to accuratelymodel the putative structures of the antibodies. The modelled structures were then passed to MDsimulations for stability check.To check the stability of predicted structures energetically, 20 MD simulations (18 point mutations+2wildtype (WT)) in total were performed (Figure 4a). Structures with low Root Mean Square Deviation(RMSD) and low contact distance are in a stable conformation, whereas structures with high RMSDand high contact distances are in an unstable conformation. RMSD and contact distance for WTstructures have lower values, demonstrating stability, therefore; the contact distances versus RMSDis a good indicator of the stability of a protein over the course of a simulation (Figure 4b).Once mutation introduced in the crystallographic structure, it will cause it to deviate from WTstructure\u2019s RMSD and contact distance. We performed simulations for all the 18 point-mutantstructures and their mean contact distance versus RMSD109,110 were computed for their respectivetrajectories (Figure 4b) (see Supporting Information). Based on the two WT structures mean RMSDand contact distances, we selected the mutations which have mean contact distance and RMSD valuesless than 0.488 nm and 0.35 nm, respectively. (the shaded triangle region in Figure 4b). Candidateswith higher values of mean RMSD and contact distances are unstable and will potentially fail toneutralize the COVID-19.In order to be more comprehensive, we created co-mutations out of 5 stable point mutations (C3, C7,C14, C17, C18, see Table S1 in Supporting Information for the list of all 18 candidates). This resultedin 5 new structures (Co1, Co2, Co3, Co4, Co5 in Table S2) that were screened using XGBoost forneutralization. Among all 5 co-mutations, Co5 did not neutralize. To check the stability of these 4neutralizing co-mutations, MD simulations were performed and Co1, Co2 and Co4 were found to bestable (Figure 4b). The list of the final 8 stable mutations and co-mutations are tabulated in Table 1and the PDB structures are available as Supporting Information.We have developed a machine learning model for high throughput screening of synthetic antibodiesto discover antibodies that potentially inhibit the COVID-19. Our approach can be widely applied toother viruses where only the sequences of viral coat protein-antibody pairs can be obtained. The MLmodels were trained on 14 different virus types and achieved over 90% fivefold test accuracy. Theout of class prediction is 100% for SARS and 84.61% for Influenza, demonstrating the power of ourmodel for neutralization prediction of antibodies for novel viruses like COVID-19. Using this model,the neutralization of thousands of hypothetical antibodies was predicted, and 18 antibodies werefound to be highly efficient in neutralizing COVID-19. Using MD simulations, the stability ofpredicted antibodies were checked and 8 stable antibodies were found that can neutralize COVID-19.In addition, the interpretation of ML model revealed that mutating to Methionine and Tyrosine ishighly efficient in enhancing the affinity of antibodies to COVID-19.The authors gratefully acknowledge the use of the supercomputing resource Arjuna provided by thePittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).

This bridge canpotentially save the life of many especially during an outbreak and pandemic. Recently, the proteomics sequences of \u2018WH-Human 1\u2019coronavirus became available through Metagenomic RNA sequencing of a patient in Wuhan.4,15WHHuman 1 is 89.1% similar to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses.4 With this sequence available, itis possible to find potential inhibitory antibodies by scanning thousands of antibody sequences anddiscovering the neutralizing ones16\u201318. However, this requires very expensive and time-consumingexperimentation to discover the inhibitory responses to Corona virus in a timely manner. Wegenerated a dataset with 1831 training examples comprising of antibodies \u2013 antigen sequences andtheir corresponding IC50 values. Furthermore, for each neutralizing complex, the contact residues at the interface ofantibody and antigen were selected. We then apply mean pooling over the features for this concatenatedembedding to ensure dimensional consistency across the training data. The pooled information isthen passed to classifier algorithms like XGBoost93, Random Forest94, Multilayer perceptron,Support Vector Machine (SVM)95 and Logistic Regression which then predict whether the antibodyis capable of neutralizing the virus. In order to find potential antibody candidates for COVID-19, 2589 different mutant strains ofantibody sequences were generated based on the sequence of SARS neutralizing antibodies. Energy minimization was carried out using steepest descentalgorithm, while restraining the peptide backbone to remove the steric clashes in atoms andsubsequently optimize solvent molecule geometry. Leapfrog dynamics integrator was used with Verlet scheme, neighbor-listwas updated every 10 steps. Following the rounds ofequilibration, production run for the system was carried out in NPT and no constraints for a total of15 nanoseconds, under identical simulation parameters. Featurization, embedding andbenchmarking ML models and selecting the best performing one. Hypothetical antibody librarygeneration and ML screening for neutralization and 4. In general, this workflow can be used for high throughput screening of antibodies for any type ofvirus by only knowing the sequences of antigen epitopes. This difference demonstrates that a large space of potential antibodies can be screened andused for finding novel antibodies. The five-fold cross validationon 80%-20% split, train, and test resulted in best accuracy for XG-Boost model. Next, using the best performing model (XGBoost), all the hypothetical candidates in the library wereevaluated for neutralization. The predicted sequences were projected onto their progenitorantibody and the changes in amino acid sequence were modelled as follows: Simple point mutationswere introduced by modifying the target amino acid using Coot 107,108(CrystallographicObjectOriented Toolkit). RMSD and contact distance for WTstructures have lower values, demonstrating stability, therefore; the contact distances versus RMSDis a good indicator of the stability of a protein over the course of a simulation (Figure 4b).Once mutation introduced in the crystallographic structure, it will cause it to deviate from WTstructure\u2019s RMSD and contact distance.
