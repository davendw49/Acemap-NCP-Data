We found that the most", "text": "sensitive assays were those the used the E-gene primer/probe set described by Corman et al.(Eurosurveillance 25(3), 2020, https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045) and the N2set described by the CDC (Division of Viral Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.pdf). All assaystested were found to be highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, with no cross-reactivity with other respiratoryviruses observed in our analyses regardless of the primer/probe set or kit used. These results willprovide invaluable information to other clinical laboratories who are actively developing SARS-CoV-2testing protocols at a time when increased testing capacity is urgently needed worldwide.        In late December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unclear etiology was first noted inWuhan City in the Hubei Province of China (                To date, the epidemic has been largely concentrated in China, with a total of 80,695 knowncases as of March 7, 2020 (3). However, cases outside of China were observed early in the epidemic withthe first detected in Thailand on January 13 (4). Soon afterwards cases were also identified in other eastAsian countries including Japan and South Korea (        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first case of COVID-19 inthe United States on January 21. The infected person was a 35 year old man who had recently returnedto his home in Snohomish County, Washington after travelling to Wuhan City (5). No additional cases ofCOVID-19 were identified in Washington State until February 28 when two new cases were confirmed,4950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071one in Snohomish County and one in neighboring King County, where Seattle is located (6). SinceFebruary 28, the number of cases of COVID-19 in Washington has steadily increased and currentlystands at 102 (7).In response to the rapidly increasing number of confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19 inthe Seattle metropolitan area, the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the University of Washington (UWVirology Lab) has begun testing clinical specimens for SARS-CoV-2. Prior to and since making this testingservice available, we have endeavored both to optimize the performance of our assay and to increasethe rate at which we are able to test samples. We report here our observations comparing threedifferent RNA extraction methods. We also compare the performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection assaysusing seven different primer/probe sets and one assay kit.          Three sets of samples were used in our analyses. First, we used a set of approximately 300clinical respiratory samples sent to the UW Virology Lab for respiratory virus testing. These sampleswere in the form of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in viral transport media and had notpreviously been tested for SARS-CoV-2. Secondly, we used a collection of nasal swabs in viral transportmedia that are used to validate all assays performed at the UW Virology Lab. This collection includessamples positive for: rhinovirus (3 samples within the set), influenza B (          Finally, we obtained a set of 10 samples confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the WashingtonState Department of Health (WSDOH) Public Health Laboratories. These samples were also allnasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs immersed in viral transport media.RNA extraction from samples was performed using two different systems, the MagNA Pure LC2.0 and the MagNA Pure 96 (Roche Lifesciences). For both systems, RNA extraction was performedaccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For the MagNA Pure LC 2.0, 200 \u00b5L of each sample wassubjected to extraction with an elution volume of 200 \u00b5L. For the MagNA Pure 96, 200 \u00b5L of eachsample was subjected to extraction with an elution volume of either 50 or 100 \u00b5L. 5 \u00b5L of RNA in elutionbuffer was used in each SARS-CoV-2 detection assay.We used a total of 7 different primer/probe sets in our SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. TheUniversity of Washington (UW) RdRp primer/probe set was designed by the UW Virology Lab. Threeadditional primer/probe sets were designed as described in Corman et al. (8); these will be referred toas the Corman N-gene, RdRp, and E-gene primer/probe sets. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) N1,N2, and N3 sets were developed by the CDC and have been published on the CDC website (9).For all of the above primer/probe sets, real-time RT-PCR assays were performed using theAgPath-ID One Step RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies). 25 \u00b5L of reaction mix consists of 2x RT-PCR buffer,25x enzyme mix, primers/probes, and 5 \u00b5L of extracted nucleic acid. Primer/probe concentrations wereas recommended in Corman et al (8) and by a CDC recommended protocol (10). RT-PCR was performedon an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with cycle parameters: 10 minutes at 48 \u00b0Cfor reverse transcription, 10 minutes inactivation at 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95 \u00b0Cand 45 seconds at 60 \u00b0C.We also tested samples for SARS-CoV-2 using the BGI RT-PCR detection kit (BGI). These assayswere conducted according to the kit manufacturer\u2019s instructions.A negative (human specimen control) was included in every RNA extraction procedure andnontemplate (water) control was included in every RT-PCR run. An internal control amplification wasperformed to monitor the extraction and RT-PCR quality.The first two primer/probes sets that we evaluated were the UW RdRp and the Corman N-genesets. We tested the sensitivity of assays using these primer/probe sets by examining approximately 300clinical samples of unknown SARS-CoV-2 status. RNA was extracted for these assays using two differentsystems. The first was the MagNA Pure LC (LC) system, which is able to process 32 samples at a time andelutes RNA into 200 \u00b5L of buffer. The second was the MagNA Pure 96 (MP96) system, which is able toprocess 96 samples at a time and elutes RNA into 100 \u00b5L of buffer. One sample out of the 300 waspositive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive result was consistent regardless of which of the two RNAextraction methods and which of the two primer/probe sets was used.We then determined the limit of detection (LOD) of assays using the UW RdRp and CormanNgene primer/probe sets when run on dilutions of the one positive clinical sample. For both RNAextraction techniques and both primer/probe sets, the LOD was found to be 1:2x103 (for eachcombination of RNA extraction method and primer/probe set, twenty out of twenty replicate assayswere positive for SARS-CoV-2 when the positive clinical sample was diluted to 1:2x103). Finally, wetested the specificity of assays using both primer/probe sets by running them on a collection of samplesthat are positive for respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2. Assays using both sets were found to be100% specific with no false positives noted in this analysis.We next tested assays using the Corman RdRp and Corman E-gene primer/probe sets. We againused two RNA extraction methods. The LC extraction method was performed using the same protocol asbefore. However, for the MP96 method, we eluted RNA into 50 \u00b5L of buffer instead of 100 \u00b5L of bufferto determine whether this would increase the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection assays. We ran assaysusing both the Corman RdRp and the Corman E-gene primer/probe sets coupled with both RNAextraction methods on 10 samples confirmed by the WSDOH Public Health Laboratories to be positivefor SARS-CoV-2. The results of these tests are shown in Table 1. There was one sample that was positivefor assays using the E-gene set when the MP96 system was used but not when the LC system was usedand two samples that were positive for assays using the RdRp set when the MP96 system was used butnot when the LC system was used. Based on these results, we subsequently used the MP96 RNAextraction system with RNA eluted into 50 \u00b5L of buffer for all analyses.To assess the sensitivity of assays using the Corman RdRp and E-gene primer/probe sets, we ranthem on dilutions of the positive UW Virology clinical sample. The LOD was found to be 1:2x104 for both(again 20 replicate assays for each primer/probe set were performed and all 20 were positive). We alsotested the specificities of assays using these sets by running them on our collection of samples positivefor various respiratory viruses. Like assays using the UW RdRp and the Corman N-gene primers, thoseusing the Corman RdRp and E-gene sets were 100% specific with no false positives noted.Given that assays using the Corman RdRp and E-gene primer/probe sets showed superiorperformance relative to those using the UW RdRp and Corman N-gene sets, we wanted to compare theformer to assays using the primer/probe sets published by the CDC: CDC N1, CDC N2, and CDC N3. Weran assays using these three sets on the 10 positive samples obtained from the WSDOH Public HealthLaboratories. The results of these analyses are shown in Table 2. All assays produced positive results forall samples, except for the assay using the CDC N3 primers/probe which produced a negative result forSC5784. The assay using the Corman RdRp set also produced a negative result for this sample. For theother nine samples, assays using the Corman RdRp set consistently produced the highest cycle times outof all the assays compared in Table 2 (CDC N1, CDC N2, CDC N3, Corman RdRp, and Corman E-gene)followed by assays using the Corman E-gene set.Our final analysis was to test the sensitivity and specificity of assays using the CDC primer/probesets and compare these to the sensitivity and specificity of assays using the Corman RdRp and E-genesets. Because assays using the N3 set did not perform as well as those using the N1 and N2 sets, we didnot include the latter set in this analysis. We did, however, include in this analysis an evaluation of thesensitivity and specificity of assays performed using a SARS-CoV-2 test kit from BGI. To directly compareBGI kit, we ran assays on dilutions ranging from 1:105 to 1:107 of the positive UW Virology clinicalsample. We again ran twenty duplicate assays with each primer/probe set and with the BGI kit on eachdilution. The results of the analysis are shown in Table 3. The least sensitive assays were the ones thatused the Corman RdRp primer/probe set. At a dilution of 1:105, only 17 out of the 20 assays that usedthis set were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The most sensitive assays used the CDC N2 and the CormanEgene sets for which 18 and 17 replicate assays, respectively, were positive at a dilution of 1:106.The specificities assays using the CDC N1 and N2 primer/probe sets and the BGI kit were alsotested using our panel of samples positive for various respiratory viruses. Assays using the N1 and N2sets and the BGI kit were found to be 100% specific.Known cases of COVID-19 have now exceeded 105,000 worldwide. While cases in China appearto be leveling off with fewer new cases diagnosed each day, new case clusters are rapidly appearing inother nations across the world (3). In the coming days and weeks, many clinical laboratories will bedeveloping their own SARS-CoV-2 testing protocols. Maximizing the sensitivity and specificity of thesetests is critical to efforts around the world to minimize the impact of this epidemic on global health.A number of different primer/probe sets for use in SARS-CoV-2 detection assays andSARS-CoV2 testing kits have been developed and are now available. As we have demonstrated here, theperformance characteristics of assays using these primer/probe sets and testing kits are variable. Of theseven different primer/probe sets and one testing kit that we evaluated, all were found to be highlyspecific with no false positive results observed when assays were run on samples positive for a numberof other respiratory viruses. Variability was, however, observed in the sensitivities of these tests. Wefound that assays using the CDC N2 and Corman E-gene primer/probe sets to be particularly sensitive.Assays using these sets were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in ten out of ten known positive clinical samples.They were also able to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 in a positive sample diluted down to 1:106. In additionto our evaluation of different assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we also show that it is possible tosignificantly increase capacity for the RNA extraction step of SARS-CoV-2 testing without sacrificingsensitivity.In summary, we report variable performance characteristics of assays using seven differentprimer/probe sets and one complete testing kit used for SARS-CoV-2 testing of clinical samples. Whileassays using all sets were highly specific, some, such as those using the CDC N2 and the Corman E-genesets, were found to be more sensitive than others. These findings will provide important insights onSARS-CoV-2 detection assay design to labs that are currently working to develop their own testingmethods. Our results also emphasize the importance of on-going optimization of viral detection assaysfollowing the emergence of novel viral pathogens.This work was support by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (grantnumber 5T32AI118690-04 T32 Training Grant to AMC at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center).World Health Organization. 2020.
