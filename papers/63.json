The S protein exists in a metastable prefusion conformationthat undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host cellmembrane (7, 8). This process is triggered by binding of the S1 subunit to a host-cell receptor,which destabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition ofthe S2 subunit to a highly stable postfusion conformation (9). In order to engage a host-cellreceptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformationalmovements that transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding. These two statesare referred to as the \u201cdown\u201d conformation and the \u201cup\u201d conformation, where \u201cdown\u201dcorresponds to the receptor-inaccessible state and \u201cup\u201d corresponds to the receptor-accessiblestate, which is thought to be less stable (10-13). Due to the indispensable function of the Sprotein it represents a vulnerable target for antibody-mediated neutralization, andcharacterization of the prefusion S structure would provide atomic-level information to guidevaccine design and development.37383940414243444546474849505152535455565758        Based on the reported genome sequen                After collecting and processing 3,207 micrograph movies, we obtained a 3.5 \u00c5-resolution3D reconstruction of an asymmetrical trimer in which a single RBD was observed in the \u201cup\u201dconformation. (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 2). Due to the small size of the RBD (~21kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation was not readily apparent until ab initio 3Dreconstruction and 3D classification were performed (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 3). Byusing the 3D variability feature in cryoSPARC v2 (15), we were able to observe breathing of theS1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely contributed to therelatively poor local resolution of S1 compared to the more stable S2 subunit (SupplementaryMovies 1 and 2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during structuralcharacterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well asthe more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)(10, 11, 13,16). The obse                Because the S2 subunit appeared to be a symmetric trimer, we performed a 3Drefinement imposing C3 symmetry, resulting in a 3.2 \u00c5-resolution map, with excellent densityfor the S2 subunit. Using both maps we built the vast majo                The overall stru                2019-nCoV S shares roughly 96% sequence identity with the S protein from the batcoronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103protease cleavage site that results in an \u201cRRAR\u201d furin re                Recent                The overall structural homology and shared receptor usage between SARS-                The        Materials and Methods        To express the prefusion S ectodomain, a gene encoding residues 1\u22121208 of 2019-nCoV S(GenBank: MN908947) with proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, a \u201cGSAS\u201dsubstitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682\u2013685), a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerizationmotif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag was synthesized andcloned into the mammalian expression ve                  These expression vectors were used to transiently transfect FreeStyle293F cells (ThermoFischer) using polyethylenimine. Protein was purified from filtered cell supernatants using eitherStrepTactin resin (IBA) or Protein A resin (Pierce) before being subjected to additionalpurification by size-exclusion chromatography using either a Superose 6 10/300 column (GEHealthcare) or a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0,200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3.

The C1 RBD \u201cup\u201d reconstruction was sharpenedin cryoSPARC, and the 3D reconstruction with C3 symmetry was subjected to local B-factorsharpening using LocalDeBlur (33). Models were built in Coot, before being iteratively refinedin both Phenix and ISOLDE (34-36). Some of the data processing and refinement software wascurated by SBGrid (37).
