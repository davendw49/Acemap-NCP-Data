Here we describe aspects of coronavirus evolutionary genetics revealed from these data, and provide the first direct RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2, detailing coronaviral subgenome-length mRNA architecture.", "text": "The ongoing epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (now called SARS-CoV-2, causing thedisease COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, China, has been declared a public healthemergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation (WHO)[1-4].SARSCoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) virus of the Coronaviridae family,with related Betacoronaviruses capable of infecting mammalian and avian hosts, resulting inillness in humans such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the original severeacute respiratory syndrome (SARS)[2, 5-6]. Based on limited sampling of potential reservoirspecies, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be most similar to bat coronaviruses at thegenomic level, potentially indicating that bats are its natural reservoir [7-8].Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, genomic analyses have played a key role in thepublic health response by informing the design of appropriate molecular diagnostics andcorroborating epidemiological efforts to trace contacts [8-10]. Taken together, publiclyavailable sequence data suggest a recently occurring, point-source outbreak, as describedin online sources [10-12]. Aspects of the response make the assumption that the genetics ofSARS-CoV-2, including mechanisms of gene expression and molecular evolutionary rates,are comparable with previously characterised coronaviruses [11-12]. It remains highlyrelevant to validate these assumptions experimentally with SARS-CoV-2-specific data, withthe potential to reveal further insights into the biology of this emergent pathogen. To addressthis, we describe (i) the architecture of the coronaviral subgenome-length mRNAs, and (ii)phylogenetic approaches able to provide robust estimates of coronaviral evolutionary ratesand timescales at this early stage of the outbreak.Characterised coronaviral species produce a nested set of polyadenylatedsubgenomelength mRNA transcripts through a mechanism termed discontinuous extension of minusstrands that yields mRNA transcripts of different length. The discontinuous transcriptionmechanism repositions the 5\u2032 leader sequence upstream of consecutive viral open-readingframes (ORF) where each translation start site becomes located at the primary position forribosome scanning (Figure 1a). Subgenome-length mRNAs have a common 5\u2032 leadersequence, near-identical to that located in the 5\u2032-UTR of the viral genome, with thegenomelength RNAs also having an mRNA function [13-14]. Discontinuous copy-choice RNArecombination modulates the expression of coronaviral genes [14-15]. Standard sequencingtechnologies for RNA viruses are unable to produce reads representing (i) RNA viralgenomes or (ii) subgenome-length mRNAs, as they generate short read lengths and have areliance on amplification to generate complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences.To define the architecture of the coronaviral subgenome-length mRNAs, a recentlyestablished direct RNA sequencing approach was used, based on a highly parallel array ofnanopores [16]. In brief, nucleic acids were prepared from culture material with high levels ofSARS-CoV-2 growth, and sequenced with use of poly(T) adaptors and an R9.4 flowcell on aGridION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Through this approach, the electroniccurrent is measured as individual strands of RNA translocate through a nanopore, withderived signal-space data basecalled to infer the corresponding nucleobases(Supplementary Methods). The SARS-CoV-2 sample produced 680,347 reads, comprising860Mb of sequence information in 40 hours of sequencing (BioProject PRJNA608224).Aligning to the genome of the cultured SARS-CoV-2 isolate (MT007544.1), a subset of readswere attributed to coronaviruses sequence (28.9%), comprising 367Mb of sequencedistributed across the 29,893 base genome. Of these, a number had lengths >20,000 bases,capturing the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 genome on a single molecule. Together, directRNA sequencing provided an average 12,230 fold coverage of the coronaviral genome,biased towards sequences proximal to the polyadenylated 3\u2019 tail; coverage ranged from 34fold to >160,000 fold (Figure 1b), with the bias reflecting the higher abundance ofsubgenome-length mRNAs carrying these sequences, as well as the directional sequencingfrom the polyadenylated 3\u2019 tail.SARS-CoV-2 features captured in direct RNA sequence data include subgenome-lengthmRNAs, as well as RNA base modifications. The shared 5\u2019-leader sequence was used as amarker to identify each subgenome-length mRNA (Supplementary Methods). InSARS-CoV2, we observed eight major viral mRNAs, in addition to the viral genome (Figure 1c). Eachannotated gene was observed as a distinct subgenome-length mRNA, positionedconsecutively 3\u2019 to the replicase polyprotein (ORF1a and 1ab) encoded by thegenomiclength mRNA, with ORF10 being the last predicted coding sequence upstream of the poly-Asequence (Supplementary Figure 1). ORF10 is the shortest of the predicted codingsequences at 117 bases in length but despite having proximity to the poly-A sequence, wasnot found as a subgenome-length mRNA through our direct RNA sequence technique.ORF10 has no annotated function, and the putative encoded peptide does not have ahomolog in the SARS-CoV proteome (Proteome ID: UP000000354). These data suggestthat the sequence currently annotated as ORF10 does not have a protein coding function inSARS-CoV-2. The sequence annotated as ORF10 is immediately upstream of the 3\u2019 UTRand, rather than coding, may act itself or as a precursor of other RNAs in the regulation ofgene expression, replication or modulating cellular antiviral pathways. A small number of cellculture-derived isolates in public databases demonstrate shared deletion of an area of the 3\u2019UTR (Supplementary Figure 2), this parallel molecular evolution suggesting the region mayhave functional roles in vivo.In addition to methylation at the 5\u2019 cap structure and 3\u2019 polyadenylation needed for efficienttranslation of viral coding sequences, other RNA modifications may have functional roles inSARS-CoV-2 [17]. A range of modifications may be identified using direct RNA sequencedata [16-17]; our available SARS-CoV-2 direct RNA sequence data providing adequatecoverage to confidently call specific modifications. Through analysis of signal-space data,we identified 42 positions with predicted 5-methylcytosine modifications, appearing atconsistent positions between subgenome-length mRNAs (Supplementary Figure 3, andTable 1). In other positive ssRNA viruses, RNA methylation can change dynamically duringthe course of infection [18], influencing host-pathogen interaction and viral replication. Othermodifications may become apparent once training datasets are available for direct RNAsequence data, with little known of the epitranscriptomic landscape of coronaviruses [17,19].As well as investigating the above assumed features of SARS-CoV-2 genetics, sequencedata also enable an estimate of the molecular evolutionary rate, through analysis of publiclyavailable SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. Evolutionary rate estimates from othercoronaviruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are not necessarilyapplicable here, particularly because MERS had multiple independent introductions intohumans [20-22]. To estimate the evolutionary rate and time of origin of the SARS-CoV-2outbreak, we carried out Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using a curated set of high qualitypublicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, each having a known collection date(Supplementary Table 2). The sampling times were sufficient to calibrate a molecular clockand infer the evolutionary rate and timescale of the outbreak; the evolutionary rate ofSARSCoV-2 was estimated to be 1.16 \u00d7 10-3 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 6.32\u00d710-41.69\u00d710-3), and the of time of origin to be early December 2019 (95% HPD November 2019,December 2019), which is in agreement with epidemiological evidence and other recentanalyses (Figure 2a) [1-4, 23-24]. Our estimate of the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is inline with those of other coronaviruses (Figure 2b), and the low genomic diversity and recenttimescale of the outbreak support a recently occurring, point-source transfer to humans.In summary, insights into the molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 are revealed through theuse of direct RNA sequence data, enabling a detailed view of viral subgenome-length mRNAarchitecture. Other insights are gleaned from publicly available sequence data, including anestimate of the molecular evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, shown to be similar to those ofpreviously studied coronaviruses and providing further information to support the forecastingand modelling of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and evolution.A) Schematic of the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 replication, including in vivo synthesis ofpositive sense genome-length RNA molecules, and subgenome-length mRNAs.

In brief, African green monkey kidneycells expressing the human signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM; termedVero/hSLAM cells accordingly) and SARS-CoV-2 were grown at 37\u00b0C at 5% CO2 in mediaconsisting of 10 mL Earle\u2019s minimum essential medium, 7% FBS (Bovogen Biologicals,Keilor East, Aus), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM Sodium pyruvate, 1500 mg/L sodiumbicarbonate, 15 mM HEPES and 0.4 mg/ml geneticin in 25cm2 flasks. The genome of thecultured isolate (MT007544.1) has three single nucleotide variants (T19065C, T22303G,G26144T) relative to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3), anda 10 base deletion in the 3\u2019 UTR. The T22303G and 3\u2019 UTR variants have been confirmedas culture-derived through Sanger sequencing of clinical and culture material.Nucleic acids were prepared from infected cellular material, following inactivation with linearacrylamide and ethanol. RNA was extracted from a modest cell pellet (~200mg) usingmanually prepared wide-bore pipette tips and minimal steps to maintain RNA length for longread sequencing, and a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). CarrierRNA was not added to Buffer AVL, with 1% linear acrylamide (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,CA, USA) added instead. Wash buffer AW1 was omitted from the purification stage, withRNA eluted in 50 \u03bcl of nuclease free water, followed by DNase treatment with Turbo DNase(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) 37\u00b0C for 30 min. RNA was cleaned andconcentrated to 10 \u03bcl using the RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine,CA, USA), as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Prepared RNA (~1\u00b5g) was carried into a direct RNA sequence library preparation with theOxford Nanopore DRS protocol (SQK- RNA002, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) followingthe manufacturer\u2019s specifications, although without addition of the Control RNA. The librarywas loaded on an R9.4 flow cell and sequenced on a GridION device (Oxford NanoporeTechnologies), with the sequencing run ending after 40 hours. Signal space data was usedto generate nucleobase sequences (\u2018basecalled\u2019) using ont-guppy-for-gridion 3.0.6. Bothsignal space and basecalled read data are available at BioProject PRJNA608224. It shouldbe noted that non-polyadenylated RNAs are not expected to be detected with this approach.Direct RNA reads passing the above thresholds were aligned to the genome of the culturedAustralian SARS-COV-2 isolate (MT007544.1), with parallel and concordant analyses inGeneious Prime (2019.2.1, [M1]) and minimap2 v 2.11 using the \u201cspliced\u201d preset [M2].Coverage statistics were determined from the resulting read alignments.To identify intact subgenome-length mRNAs, reads were aligned to a 62 base SARS-COV-2leader sequence (5\u2019ACCUUCCCAGGUAACAAACCAACCAACUUUCGAUCUCUUGUAGAUCUGUUCUCUAAACGAAC), with reads aligning to the leader sequence being pooled andvisualized in a length histogram. Significant peaks were identified visually and confirmedwith a smoothed z-score algorithm. Reads captured in this binning-by-length strategy werere-aligned to the reference genome using the above methods and visualized in Tablet [M3].Subgenome bins were refined to remove reads which did not originate at the 3\u2019 poly-A tail asexpected for intact subgenome-length mRNAs. Subgenome bins were re-aligned, withcoverage calculated in SAMtools [M4], and plotted using ggplot2 [M5] in R [M6]. The IPKnotwebserver [M7] was used to predict the RNA secondary structures, and the VARNAvisualization applet [M8] used to produce schematics.Nanopore sequencing preserves in vivo base modifications and enables their detection fromraw voltage signal information. In brief, the signal space fast5 files corresponding toidentified subgenome-length mRNAs were assessed to identify signal changescorresponding to 5mC methylation. These were first retrieved using the fast5_fetcher_multifunction in SquiggleKit [M9]. Reads were processed to align raw signal with basecalledsequence data using Tombo v1.5 [https://github.com/nanoporetech/tombo]. Canonicalreference sequences were made for each subgenome-length mRNAs, with the binned fast5files input into the detect_modifications function, with 5mC as the alternate-modelparameter. Outputs of which were converted to dampened_fraction wiggle files and exportedfor visualization and analysis.from GISAID and GenBank (Supplementary Table 2). Temporal signal was assessed usingBETS [M11]. Initially we determined whether the evolutionary signal and time over which thegenome data were collected was sufficient to calibrate the molecular clock, allowing for theevolutionary rate and timescale of the outbreak to be inferred. The model selection approachfrom BETS supported a strict molecular clock model with genome sampling times forcalibration and a coalescent exponential tree prior, which posits that the number of infectedindividuals grows exponentially over time. We used the HKY+\u0393 substitution model, and setthe following priors for key parameters:\u2022 A continuous time Markov chain for the evolutionary rate\u2022 A Laplace distribution with mean of 0 and scale of 100 for the growth rate\u2022 An exponential distribution with mean of 1 for the effective population size.A Markov chain Monte Carlo of length 107 was set, sampling every 103 steps, and assessedsufficient sampling by verifying that the effective sample size for all parameters was at least200 as determined in Tracer [M12], automatically discarding 10% of the burn in. Wesummarised the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees by selecting the highest cladecredibility tree alongside calculating posterior node probabilities and the distribution of nodeages.

Clock and TMRCA based on 27 genomes. The T22303G and 3\u2019 UTR variants have been confirmedas culture-derived through Sanger sequencing of clinical and culture material. Direct RNA reads passing the above thresholds were aligned to the genome of the culturedAustralian SARS-COV-2 isolate (MT007544.1), with parallel and concordant analyses inGeneious Prime (2019.2.1, [M1]) and minimap2 v 2.11 using the \u201cspliced\u201d preset [M2].Coverage statistics were determined from the resulting read alignments. In brief, the signal space fast5 files corresponding toidentified subgenome-length mRNAs were assessed to identify signal changescorresponding to 5mC methylation. These were first retrieved using the fast5_fetcher_multifunction in SquiggleKit [M9]. 2018Sep 15;34(18):3094-100.[M3] Milne I, Bayer M, Stephen G, Cardle L, Marshall D.
