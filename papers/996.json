A 47-year-old man had a history of cough, sputum production,sore throat and throbbing headache for 3 days without fever. Hehas been living in Chengdu, Sichuan province, for a long time.However, his mother had traveled to Wuhan a week ago andwas diagnosed with the new coronavirus after she got backhome. He has referred to the emergency department of ourinstitution on        After receiving 3 days of treatment with an antiviral(Veletonavir), and anti-inflammatory (Methylprednisolone), thepatient\u2019s cough was relieved, and repeated chest CT (5 February2020) showed the extent and density of lesions weresignificantly decreased (Figure 1B). Laboratory tests, however, showed thatlymphocytes were still reduced, and erythrocyte sedimentationrate was increased.        On 6 February 2020, the patient began to have a fever (bodytemperature 38.6 C) then additional antibiotics (Piperacillin\u2013tazobactam) was given. Unfortunately, 2 days later, the patient\u2019sbody temperature reached a maximum of 39.0 C, accompaniedby a paroxysmal cough, and the whole body\u2019s skin was flushing.CT images (9 February 2020) manifested as extensivegroundglass opacities, consolidation in bilateral lungs. Oddly,compared with CT images of the last two times (Figure 1C), all thelesions were found in different locations (Figure 1D). On 1        An unknown respiratory illness emerged and spread in WuhanCity, Hubei province of China, in December 2019. The initialsymptoms of the affected patients include fever, cough ormuscle weakness.1 Soon after, the Chinese Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) reported that the respiratoryillness was caused by a novel coronavirus, which named \u20182019Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\u2019 by the World HealthOrganization (WHO).2 Unfortunately, it has spread rapidly to allother parts of China in the past 2 months. By 13 February 2020,there were 59 804 confirmed cases in China, 13 435 suspectedcases, 1367 deaths and 5911 discharged patients.In this case, during the patient hospital stay, both two timesof nucleic acid tests were positive. According to repeated CTscans, the patient\u2019s condition seemed to get improvement butsomehow deteriorated suddenly. It is suggested that thecondition of patients infected by 2019-nCoV can be waved andlingering. Under the circumstances, CT imaging is not only useful forthe detection, location of lesions but also helpful in theevaluation of the dynamic changes of patients with 2019-nCoV.
