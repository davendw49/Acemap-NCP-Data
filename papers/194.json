Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to predict COVID-19 times of arrival (ToA) for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we provide estimated ToA for all other countries. By combining effective distance with a measure for the country's vulnerability (Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI)), we propose a metric to rank vulnerable countries at immediate risk of case emergence. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries.", "text": "results indicate multiple countries (many with low IDVI, hence highly vulnerable) might see (or already have seen) caseemergence in the month of February. We propose IDVI-weighted effective distance as a metric to compare twocountries accounting for vulnerability and risk of importation.We then model the impact of flight suspensions to and from China that is being witnessed globally, while ensuring thatthe effective distances with and without interventions (i.e., suspensions) are comparable through normalization. Thereduced flow from China results in a modified network with reduced edge weights and almost all countries see anincrease in their effective distance from China, with some countries having higher increase than others. We also observe achange in rank of countries as per the IDVI-weighted effective distance (Figures 3 and 4).        There are multiple ongoing attempts to use airline traffic data to quantify global risk posed by COVID-19. In [                Some key differences: (a) We use IATA data which contains actual flow volume between origin-destination airports(including transit points) instead of OAG data (used by [3]) which contains total number of seats available for a givensegment. We believe that origin-destination flows by IATA provides a better estimate of population level exposure, and thelikelihood of detecting the first case in a country (rather than at the transit airports), thus serves as a better networkon which to compute effective distance (cf. Appendix A). While [                IATA [5] provides comprehensive air travel data covering 12000 airports across the world. Given a source anddestination airport, it provides the number of passengers traveling between the two airports as reported by the airlines(\u201creported PAX\u201d) and the IATA estimated (\u201creported + estimated PAX\u201d) per month. The travel details include both directand multi-hop connections between the airports. In addition, it provides the different carriers serving the two airports,which allow for simulating airline cancellations using historical data. For this analysis, we used data from the month ofFebruary 2019. Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) [9] is a metric developed by the RAND Corporationto identify countries potentially most vulnerable to poorly controlled infectious disease outbreaks because of confluenceof factors (including political, economic, public health, medical, demographics), and disease dynamics. Arrival timesare curated from the official situation reports [        We use international air traffic data from February 2019, which is the most recent data that coincides with the LunarNew Year period, known to involve a large movement of people in and out of China. As mentioned previously, IATAdata provides number of passengers between two airports. We aggregate the flows out of all the airports in China to allthe airports within the country of interest. We treat non-stop routes and routes with transit equivalently, since we areprimarily interested in passenger volumes traveling out of China disembarking at various destination countries.In order to model the risk due to direct importation, we consider the number of passengers whose trip originated inairport m and ended in airport n ( through multiple paths) as obtained from IATA database. This data extracted fromIATA is different from the number of available seats between m and n ( i.e., the link capacity which could be used bypassengers using m ! n as a transit) considered in [3]. Hence, the computed effective distances would be differentand the difference is explained in Appendix A. We compute the fraction of flows from China to any givencountryof-interest and determine its effective distance. We develop a linear estimator for COVID-19 ToA at various countriesusing the effective distance to China. This allows us to \u201cpredict\u201d when COVID-19 is most likely to be reported byvarious countries.Further, two countries with similar effective distances do not necessarily rank the same in terms of risk of sustained,undetected or uncontrolled epidemic outbreak. In order to capture this aspect, we consider the product of effectivedistance of a country to its IDVI to rank the countries by risk to COVID-19.        Finally, using airline suspensions data from [        Using a linear model for the reported time of arrival against the effective distance computed on IATA data, we observea moderately high coefficient of determination R2 = 0:78. A scatter plot of COVID-19 ToA for countries withreported cases with respect to their effective distance from China is shown in Figure 1a. It should be noted that in theregression analysis, China has effective distance and time of arrival set to zero. The difference between reported ToAand the estimated ToA is provided in Figure 1b. The median error in estimation is less than a day with the estimatedToA typically being earlier than the reported ToA. Note that there are a few outliers which have much earlier reportedToA than estimated ToA ( e.g., Nepal, Japan, Thailand). For these countries, airline traffic may not be representative ofthe total connectivity with China due to their spatial proximity ( land or sea). In order to assess the risk of directimportation of COVID-19 from China to various countries we show a plot of the estimated ToA at each country to theirvulnerability ( IDVI) in Figure 2. The Combatant Commands provide a rough continent-level grouping of countries.As demonstrated in Figure 1a, the countries with reported cases ( shown with plus marker) are mostly to the left.Interestingly, most countries with reported cases also have higher IDVI, which may be due to a combination of ( a) highconnectivity and air traffic to China, ( b) better detection and reporting capabilities for imported cases. In general, the403530oA25T2015lower left region ( low IDVI and low estimated ToA) indicates a regime of high risk, which is relatively empty for thisoutbreak. However, we notice that several low IDVI countries ( especially those in AFRICOM) are estimated to havetimes of arrival in the first three weeks of February. Equally concerning are countries to the left with circle markers( some of which are highlighted), which have an early estimated time of arrival but haven\u2019t officially reported cases yet.author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.IVDI0.40.20.00remains high ( due to low IDVI).We select the countries for which there have been no imported cases, and compute their new estimated time ofarrival using the updated effective distance. For this process, we use the regression coefficients that were computed usingknown arrival times. Figure 4 shows the scatter plots of estimated ToA vs. IDVI for the countries before and after theimposition of airline suspensions. The ellipses indicate the confidence interval of the point clouds corresponding tothe respective combatant commands. The increase in ellipse widths and mean shift to the right ( due to constant IDVI)between Figure 4a and Figure 4b indicate the effect of flight cancellations on estimated ToA. On an average, countriesin AFRICOM see the largest average increase in estimated ToA of nearly 11 days, followed by countries inSOUTHCOM showing an average increase of 8 days.Our work is an initial attempt at quantifying the impact of airline suspensions on COVID-19 direct importation risk.Some of the limitations of the current work can be overcome with more timely data availability and improved modelassumptions. Firstly, the current observations are based on first official reports which in some cases can be quitedifferent from first importations. Also, due to the evolving nature of the outbreak and limited observations, the linearestimator coefficients could change with new reports and altered travel conditions.While air traffic data from IATA allows us to quantify population exposure, ( a) it is dated and may not be reflective ofcurrent conditions; ( b) may not be representative of all human mobility between the countries. As we observed, somecountries that are geographically closer to China ( e.g., Nepal, Thailand and Japan) have very early arrival times ( inrelation to estimates based on effective distance). This highlights the need to account for multi-modal transport networksfor quantifying the risk of global importations. However, this also raises concerns about other countries and regions( such as Pakistan, Myanmar and Northeastern India) which are geographically adjacent to China but haven\u2019t reportedany cases yet.Finally, we have considered China as a single origin, while there exists case counts by province. The current analysiscan be extended by considering weighting the effective distance from multiple origins with their relative levels ofinfection. Further, while we have tried to incorporate data on airline suspensions, this may not be complete ( for instanceChinese airlines are not listed), and will not capture the actual reductions in flow volumes due to travel advisories,government restrictions and behavioral adaptations. There are also a number of screening procedures in place atinternational airports, which could potentially delay case importations.While providing a preliminary analysis using COVID-19 official reports and airline suspensions, this work also laysout a framework for rapid risk assessment for an emerging and ongoing outbreak. We believe that using near real-timemulti-modal mobility datasets and detailed disease surveillance with qualitative and quantitative inputs on ongoinginterventions and preparedness efforts will aid in swift and efficient global response to such outbreaks.Market IS data. International air transport association ( IATA). URL: https://www.iata.org.Consider the two networks presented in Figure 5. Here m, `a, `b, `c, and n represent the nodes and the effectivedistance is computed between node m and n. Figure 5a represents the network construction using IATA data forcomputing the effective distance between node m and n. In this construction, fmn represents the number of passengers(passenger flow) on the path [(m; n)]. IATA data consists of all the paths (along with the flow) that were used bypassengers in the travel between source m and destination n. In the example network (Figure 5a), the paths are = f[(m; n)];[(m; `a); (`a; n)]; [(m; `b); (`b; `c); (`c; n)]g with respective flows as fmn, fm`an, fm`b`cn. The total flow between nodesm and n is the sum of the flows through all the paths connecting them and we denote it as Fmn = fm`an + fmn +fm`b`cn. With Pk Fmk as the total outflow from node m, we define Fmn = Fmn= Pk Fmk, as the probability of atraveller exiting node m has destination node n.
