The core of the SARS-CoV -1PRF signal begins with the U UUA AACslippery site. This is followed by a 6 nt spacerregion, which is then followed by thethreestemmed -1 PRF stimulating mRNApseudoknot. A second regulatory element, calledthe attenuator hairpin, is located 5\u2019 of theslippery site. Pairwise analysis of theSARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signalsrevealed that the sequence of the attenuatorhairpin was less well conserved than theframeshift-stimulating pseudoknot (Fig. 1B).The structure of the SARS-CoV -1 PRF signalwas previously determined to include athreestemmed mRNA pseudoknot (                PRF signals. Standard dual-luciferase assayswere used to monitor -1 PRF activities of thetwo -1 PRF signals (                Mutations that alter rates of -1 PRF efficiencyhave been shown to be deleterious to replicationof SARS-CoV (        SARS-CoV-2 -1 PRF signal was identified fromthe complete genome sequence (NCBI Ref SeqNC_045512.2). The EMBOSS Water pairwisealignment tool was used to identify sequences inthe SARS-CoV-2 genome most similar to theSARS-CoV -1 PRF sequence. One hit wasreported between bases 13461 and 13547 ofSARS-CoV-2 that was 98.9% identical to theoriginal SARS sequence. The SARS-CoV-2sequence contains a single point mutation fromC to A at base 13533. EMBOSS Water was usedto generate pairwise alignments betweensequences derived from SARS-CoV (GenBankentry NC_004718.3 begin nt 13361, end nt13478) and SARS-CoV-2 (Genbank entryNC_045512.2, begin nt 13431, end nt 13547).        transformation. Reporter plasmids forSARSCoV-2 were generated by oligonucleotide sitedirected mutagenesis using the NEB Q5 Sitedirected mutagenesis kit (cat. #E0554S).
