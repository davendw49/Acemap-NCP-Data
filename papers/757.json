We collect time series of reported COVID-19 cases in Republic of Korea from 20January to 1 March 2020 [        primary COVID-19 case follows a negative binomial (NB) distribution, with mean R0and dispersion parameter k [3]. Here, the R0 is the basic reproduction number ofCOVID-19. The k measures the likelihood of the superspreading events, and a larger kmeans the superspreading is less likely to occur. The onset date of each secondarycase is the summation of the onset date of the primary case (t) plus the serial interval(SI). In this work, the SI was assumed as a Gamma distribution with a 4.5-day meanand a 3.1-day standard deviation (SD) [4-7]. The transmission process was simulatedstochastically.Since the number of early reported cases are stable, which appears no sign of theoutbreak in January 2020, we consider the self-sustaining transmission might startsince February 2020. Hence, we simulated the transmission starting on\u2022\u202231 January 2020, andwith one seed infection. The R0 and k were estimated by the maximum likelihoodestimates approach that fit the reported cases with Poisson-distributed likelihoodframework as follows.log\u2211log;,.(1)Here, the l(\u00b7) is the overall log-likelihood and T is the total number of days since thestart of transmission. The nt represents number of cases reported on t-th day. Wecalculated 95%confidence intervals (95%CI) by using the profile likelihoodestimation approach determined by a Chi-square quantile.In Table 1, we estimated the R0 at 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3\u22122.9) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9\u22123.5)with the transmission starting date on 31 January and 5 February 2020 respectively.consistent with [3] and suggested the unlikelihood of superspreading events.Fig 1 showed that the fitting results matched the observed number of cases well. Ourestimated R0 in Republic of Korea is relatively higher than that in Shim et al.\u2019s [8],which set the transmission starting date on 20 January 2020 and the onset date datawere considered. Here we use laboratory confirmation date data which covered bothsymptomatic and asymptomatic cases. In addition, the R0 estimate was largelyconsistent with those estimates based on the epidemic curve in China [9,10]. If therewere evidences suggesting that the exponential growth started earlier, we note that theR0 estimate would decrease. Public activities in the late date and cold weather in ourstudy period could have speed up the transmission which explains the higherestimates.The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Republic of Korea could be amplified due tolarge-scale gathering activities [11]. Without public health control or self-protectivemeasures, the epidemic was likely to grow in a relatively large rate. The R0 estimateand the rapid growth of epidemic curves both indicates the disease transmissibility.Thus, control measures as well as self-administered protective actions are crucial toreduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus mitigate the outbreak size andprevent for further burden. Given the superspreading is unlikely to occur, we can beconfident to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing the reproduction number tobelow unity.estimates under different starting transmission date.transmission startingdate31 JanuaryR02.6 (2.3, 2.9)3.2 (2.9, 3.5)dispersion> 10> 10(a) Starting transmission date: 31 January(b) Starting transmission date: 05 Februaryobservedsimulation (without dispersion)simulation (with dispersion)40003000sesac2fo000#.muc1000040003000sesac2fo000#.muc10000Jan 31Feb 15Mar 01Feb 5Feb 17Mar 01Republic of Korea.
