An additional N-terminal \u03b2-hairpin(V31-K50) was built with the guidance of an unambiguous cryo-EM map (fig. S3A), inserting intothe groove clamped by the NiRAN domain and the palm subdomain in the RdRp domain (Fig. 2).The nsp7-nsp8 pair shows a conserved structure similar to the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 pair (6, 10).The orientation of the N-terminal helix of another individual nsp8 bound to nsp12 is shiftedcompared with that in the nsp7-nsp8 pair (fig. S4). The polypeptides of nsp12 can be traced in themap, except for S1-V30, T51-S68, H75, K103-V111, D336, T896-S904, F921-Q932, whichcannot be observed.        Although the ove                The polymerase domain adopts the conserved architecture of the viral polymerase family (11) andis composed of three subdomains, including a fingers subdomain (residues S397-A581 andK621G679), a palm subdomain (residues T582-P620 and T680-Q815), and a thumb subdomain(residues H816-E920) (Fig. 1). The catalytic cations, which are usually observed in viralpolymerase structure for RNA synthesis (12, 13) are not observed, possibly because manganesewas not included in the buffer for purification or in the cryo-EM sampling buffe        In this structure, the four positively charged solvent-accessible paths converge into a central cavitywhere the RdRp motifs mediate template-directed RNA synthesis (Fig. 3D). The configurations ofthe template/primer entry paths, the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry channel, and the nascentstrand exit path are similar to those described for HCV and PV polymerase (14) (Figs. 3, B and C).The NTP entry channel is formed by a set of hydrophilic residues, including K545, R553 and R555in motif F. The RNA template is expected to enter the active site composed of motifs A and Cthrough a groove clamped by motif F and G. Motif E and the thumb subdomain support the primerstrand. The product-template hybrid exits the active site through the RNA exit tunnel at the frontside of the polymerase.        Remdesivir, the single Sp isomer of the 2-ethylbutyl L-alaninate phosphoramidate prodrug (15)(fig. S7), has bee        The rapid global spread of 2019-nCoV has emphasized the need for the development of newcoronavirus vaccines and therapeutics. The viral polymerase nsp12 looks an excellent target fornew therapeutics, especially given that lead inhibitors already exist in the form of compounds suchas remdesivir. This target, in addition to other promising drug targets such as the main protease,whose structure was recently determined by our group (18) in complex with an inhibitor (19, 20)will support the development of a cocktail of anti-coronavirus treatments that potentially can beused for the discovery of broad-spectrum antivirals.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23.24.25.26.27.28.K.

(A) Overall structure of theNterminal        Protein production and purificationThe 2019-nCoV nsp12 (GenBank: MN908947) gene was cloned into a modified pET-22avector, with the C-terminus possessing a 10 \u00d7 His-tag. The plasmids were transformed into E. coilBL21 (DE3), and the transformed cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in LB media containing 100 mg/Lampicillin. After the OD600 reached 0.8, the culture was cooled to 16 \u00b0C and supplemented with0.5 mM IPTG. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested through centrifugation, and thepellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl,10% glycerol) and homogenized with an ultra-high-pressure cell disrupter at 4 \u00b0C. The insolublematerial was removed through centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. The fusion protein was first purifiedby Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and elution with lysis buffer and then further purified bypassage through a Hitrap Q ion-exchange column (GE Healthcare, USA) before loading onto aSuperdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare, USA) in a buffer containing 20 mMTrisHCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 4 mM MgCl2. Purified nsp12 was concentrated to 4 mg ml/L andstored at 4 \u00b0C.        The full-le        Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collectionAn aliquot of 3 \u03bcL of the sample at 0.7 mg/mL (added with 0.025% DDM) was applied ontoa H2/O2 glow-discharged, 300-mesh Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH,Germany). The grid was then blotted for 3.0 s with a blot force of 0 at 8\u00b0C and 100% humidityand plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cryo-EMdata were collected with a 300 keV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific,USA) and a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, USA). Images were recorded at EFTEMwith a 165000\u00d7 magnification and calibrated super-resolution pixel size 0.82 \u00c5/pixel. Theexposure time was set to 5 s with a total accumulated dose of 60 electrons per \u00c52. All images wereautomatically recorded using SerialEM (21) with a defocus range from 1.0 \u03bcm to 1.8 \u03bcm. Statisticsfor data collection and refinement are summarized in Table S1.Cryo-EM image processingAll dose-fractioned images were motion-corrected and dose-weighted by MotionCorr2software (22) and their contrast transfer functions were estimated by cryoSPARC patch CTFestimation. 2,334,248 particles were auto-picked using blob picker and extracted with a box sizeof 300 pixels in cryoSPARC (23). The following 2D, 3D classifications and refinements were allperformed in cryoSPARC. 918,133 particles were selected after two rounds of 2D classification.100,000 particles were used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in five classes, and then these fiveclasses were used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement with all selected particles,with 110,176 particles converged into one class. Then, this particle set was used to perform5homogeneous refinement, yielding a resolution of 3.1 \u00c5. After local refinement, the finalresolution reached 2.9 \u00c5.Model building and refinement        To solve the st        R33A34D36Y38N39A43G44F45A46K47F481,11,11,5,22,1,24311222D126,K121D126,A125D208,Y728,S236Y728,H725,E729H725Q724Y728S709S709Y129D711Fig. S5.5Interaction between the \u03b2-hairpin with other domains. *Numbers represent the number of atom-to-atom contactsbetween the residues of \u03b2-hairpin and the residues in other domains.
