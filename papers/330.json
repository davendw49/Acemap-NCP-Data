Instead, we propose to estimatethe asymptomatic ratio by using information on Japanese nationals that evacuated fromWuhan, China on chartered flights.which can be calculated as m/(n+m), as seen in Figure 1. The asymptomatic ratio is thusestimated at 50.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.5%, 87.5%) among evacuees.

Estimates such as this therefore provideimportant insight by using a targeted population to assess prevalence of asymptomaticviral shedding. Despite a small sample size, our estimation indicates that perhaps morethan a half of 2019-nCoV-infected individuals are asymptomatic. This ratio iscomparable to that of influenza, which was estimated at 56\u201380%3 using similardefinitions for symptomatic individuals. There is great need for further studies on theprevalence of asymptomatic 2019-nCoV infections to guide epidemic control efforts.We declare that we have no conflict of interest.References:1.
