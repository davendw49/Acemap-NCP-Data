The family Coronaviridae comprises large, single, plus-stranded RNA viruses isolated from severalspecies and previously known to cause common colds and diarrheal illnesses in humans [        While prompt diagnosis and patient isolation are the hallmarks for an initial control of this newepidemic, molecular epidemiology, evolutionary models and phylogenetic analysis can helpestimate genetic variability and the evolutionary rate that in turn have important implications fordisease progression as well as for drug and vaccine development. In this short report, we provide aphylogenetic three of the 2019 nCoV and identify sites of positive or negative selection pressure indistinct regions of the virus.The complete genomes of 15 2019-nCoV sequences have been downloaded from GISAID(https://www.gisaid.org/) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). A dataset havebeen built using 5 Highly similar sequences for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus (SARS),2 sequences for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and 5 Highly similar sequences for BatSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus respectively. The percentage of similarity has beenidentifiedusing(BLAST;https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), eventual duplicated sequences have been excluded fromthe datasets. The Dataset including 27 sequences has been aligned using multiple sequencealignment (MAFFT) online tool [4] and manually edited using Bioedit program v7.0.5 [5].Maximum likelihood (ML) methods were employed for the analyses because they allow for testingdifferent phylogenetic hypotheses by calculating the probability of a given model of evolutiongenerating the observed data and by comparing the probabilities of nested models by the likelihoodratio test. The best-fitting nucleotide substitution model was chosen by JModeltest software [6]. MLtree was reconstructed using Generalised time reversible (GTR) plus Gamma distribution andinvariant sites (+G +I) as evolutionary model using MEGA-X. [7]Adaptive Evolution Server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to find eventual sites of positiveor negative selection. At this purpose the following tests has been used: fast-unconstrained Bayesianapproximation (FUBAR) [8]. These tests allowed to infer the site-specific pervasive selection, theepisodic diversifying selection across the region of interest and to identify episodic selection atindividual sites [9]. Statistically significant positive or negative selection was based on p value <0.05 [9].        Homology models have been built relying on the website SwissModel [        The ML phylogenetic tree, performed on whole genome sequences, is represented in Figure 1. Inthe tree, MERS virus sequences formed a distinct clade (clade I) from Bat SARS-like coronavirus,SARS virus and the 2019-nCoV clustering together in clade II. This clade includes two differentclusters, the cluster IIa with Bat SARS-like coronavirus and the 2019-nCoV sequences whereas thecluster IIb with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus and the SARS virus sequences. The 2019-nCoV issignificantly closely related only to the specific Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolated fromRhinolophus sinicus in 2015 in China (MG772934.1) (Figure 1).Regarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the N Region, significant (p-value<0.05) pervasiveepisodic selection was found in 2 different sites (380th and 409th nucleotide position using thereference sequence; Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeledMN908947.3). Concerning the sequences in clade II, on the 409th aminoacidic position in Wuhancoronavirus sequence there is a glutamine instead of an asparagine residue while on the 380thaminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence there is a threonine residue instead of analanine.. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negative selection in 6 sites (14%) has been evidenced andconfirmed by FUBAR analysis.On the S Region, significant (p-value < 0.05) pervasive episodic selection was found in 2 differentsites (536th and 644th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; Wuhan seafood marketpneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan-Hu-1 MN908947.3). For the sequences in clade II, on the536th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence there is a asparagine residue instead ofan aspartic acid residue while on the 644th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequencethere is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive negativeselection in 1065 sites (87%) has been evidenced and confirmed by FUBAR analysis, suggestingthat S Region could be highly conserved.No sites under positive selection sites have been found in the E and M region.The N region of the 2019-nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirusnucleocapsid protein structure (2jw8.1) since the statistical test have shown that this is the moststable and similar model among the other possible structures (Ramachandran Favoured 90.52%,GMQE 0.17, QMEAN -2.43), while for the S region the 2019-nCoV homology model has beenbuilt using a SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein (6acc.1) for the same reasons (RamachandranFavoured 87.87%, GMQE 0.83, QMEAN -3.14)The further structural and molecular analysis of the Nucleocapsid region of the 2019-nCoV(MN908947.3) has highlighted that 2019-nCoV and the Bat SARS-like coronavirus (MG772934.)share the same aminoacidic sequence near the 309th position (SKQLQQ) while the SARS referencegenome has a different aminoacidic sequence (SRQLQN). The same results have been found in the380th aminoacidic position (KADET for 2019-nCoV and Bat SARS-like coronavirus and KTDEAfor the SARS reference genome), in particular, in this case, the 2019-nCoV has a polar amino acidwhile the SARS has a non-polar amino acid (Figure 2).Regarding the sites under positive selective pressure found on the Spike Glycoprotein, the resultshave shown that the 536th aminoacidic position in 2019-nCoV has an asparagine residue while theBat SARS-like coronavirus has a glutamine residue, the SARS virus, instead, has an aspartic acidresidue. On the 644th aminoacidic position in 2019-nCoV sequence there is a threonine residuewhile the Bat SARS-like virus has a serine residue, instead the SARS virus has an alanine residueThe data reported above show that the new 2019-nCoV significantly clustered with a sequence fromthe Bat SARS-like Coronavirus isolated in 2015. Moreover, in the phylogenetic tree, these twosequences are separated from the other Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequences, suggesting that thisBat SARS-like coronavirus is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019-nCoV than tothe other sequences of Bat SARS-like coronavirus. This supports thehypothesis thatthetransmission chain began from bat and reached the human. All other genomic sequencesrepresented in the phylogenetic tree, also includingseparately thus excluding that the virus involved in the actual epidemic could belong to thesesubgenuses. The structural analysis of two important viral protein, the nucleocapsid and the spike-likenucleoprotein (protein S), confirmed the significant similarity the new coronavirus with thebatlike SARS coronavirus and its difference from SARS coronavirus.From the selective pressure and structural analysis, mutations of surface proteins, as the spikeprotein S, and of nucleocapsid N protein conferring stability to the viral particle have been shown.The viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell after by binding to a cell receptorand membrane fusion, two key roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. The N protein is astructural protein involved in virion assembly, playing a pivotal role in virus transcription andassembly efficiency. Mutation of these proteins could determine two important characteristics of thecoronavirus isolated during the 2019nCoV epidemic, a higher stability than the bat-like SARScoronavirus and a lower pathogenicity than SARS coronavirus. These features can explain the2019-nCoVzoonotic transmission and        its initial lower severity than SARS epidemic. Theseresults doesn\u2019t exclude that further mutation due to positive selective pressure, lead by the epidemicevolution, could favor an ehancement of pathogenicity and transmission of this novel virus.Recently, Ji et al. described homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of 2019nCoVfavoring cross-species transmission and suggested snake as probable virus reservoir for humaninfection because its Resampling Similarity Codon Usage (RSCU) bias is more similar to Bungarusmulticinctus snake compared to other animals and humans[3]. In a previous article has been proventhat compositional properties, mutation pressure, natural selection, gene expression anddinucleotides affect the codon usage bias of Bungarus species [        These data along with data from our study, enforcing bat origin of infection, could clarify thetransmission dynamic of the 2019-nCoV supporting infection control policy during the ongoingepidemic.REFERENCESspike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross\u2010speciestransmission from snake to human.
