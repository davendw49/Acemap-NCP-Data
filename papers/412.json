Jing Chen2. Hongcai ShangTo examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) inthis field.This study is a review.Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered. Conditions ofpatients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditionalChinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients,psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19.The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurementtimes were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis.Results19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 160 protocols. Forprotocols of TCM clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, andalmost half (34/76, 44.74%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reportedoutcome was time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative. 27 (27/76, 35.53%) outcomes wereprovided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 10 outcomes were provided one or moremeasurement time frame. For protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 126 outcomes from 17outcome domains were reported; almost half (62/126, 49.21%) of outcomes were reported onlyonce; the most frequently reported outcome was proportion of patients with negativeSARS-CoV-2. 27 outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 40(40/126, 31.75%) outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame.Keywords: Outcomes; clinical trials, COVID-19; review.Strengths and limitations of this study1. This review is the first to describe variation in outcomes, outcome measurement instrumentsand outcome measurement time reporting in clinical trials for Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19).2. All the database of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platformwere searched, andrandomized controlled trials and observational studies were considered.4. The aim of this review was to provide a list of outcomes for clinical trials of COVID-19, bothinterventions of Traditional Chinese Medicine and western medicine were considered.5. When the searching was conducted, no clinical trials were registered by countries out of China,so all of included protocols were from China.Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred inWuhan, Hubei Province from December 2019, the disease, which was named as CoronavirusDisease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO) on February 12, 2020.According to the website of National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China(NHC-PRC), 77,658 confirmed cases have been reported from all areas of China until 0 o\u2019clock,February 25, 2020. 27,323 cured patients discharged, 2,663 patients died [1]. On the website ofWHO showed that 2559 confirmed cases have been reported in 33 countries out of China, 34patients died at 10AM CET, February 25 2020 [2].However, there is still no specific medicine for COVID-19 now. In China, the governmentencourages traditional Chinese medicine (herbal medicine, moxibustion, Baduanjin, etc.) to takean important role in clinical practice. The NHC-PRC and National Administration of TraditionalChinese Medicine (NATCM) have released the Version 6.0 of Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelinefor COVID-19 (informal version) on February 18, 2020 [3]. The guideline recommended generaltherapy methods, such as oxygen support, or trying to use alpha-interferon, Lopinavir/Ritonavir,Ribavirin, Chloroquine phosphate, Abidol, etc. For severe and critical type of disease, high flownasal catheter oxygen therapy, invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO), plasma of survivors, glucocorticoid, plasma exchange oraccording to the patients\u2019 situation. The guideline also recommended TCM therapy methods,including herbal medicine formulas and proprietary Chinese medicine according to TCMsyndromes, which are analyzed by clinical symptoms and signs through four methods of diagnosis:inspection, auscultation and olfaction, interrogation, and palpation.At the same time, an increasing number of clinical trials are conducting. After searching someprotocols of clinical trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiTCR) and ClinicalTrials.gov,we found that different researchers chose different outcomes. It is very important for clinical trialsto provide evidence in treating COVID-19. However, the heterogeneity of outcomes make itimpossible to conduct meta-analysis in the future, which may reduce the value of clinical trialsand improve waste.We are going to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials of COVID-19. The studyhave been registered in Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) database [4].The first clinical trial of COVID-19 was registered on January 23, 2020 [5]. When we registeredthe COS study, there were about 50 clinical trials registered [4]. On February 25, 2020, thenumber of registered trials increased to 297. Before we finish the COS, we believe that it is veryimportant to draw researchers\u2019 attention to concern about outcomes in their research. So weconducted a review of outcome reporting from registered clinical trials of COVID-19. BecauseTCM and western medicine take the same role in the treatment of COVID-19 in China, so thereview includes both interventions.All the databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform [6] were considered.1. The population should include conformed patients of COVID-19.2. Patients\u2019 conditions include common type, severe type or critical type.3. The interventions include any type of TCM therapy or western therapy.4. The study types include randomized controlled trial (RCT) and observation study.1. Studies for discharged patients.2. Studies for psychological intervention.3. Studies for complications of COVID-19.disagreement was resolved by discussion.Two reviewers (RQ and XW) independently assessed all the registered protocols. AnyTwo reviewers (RQ and MZ) independently extracted information. The information includedthe primary investigators\u2019 name, study type, type of disease, primary sponsor, number of settings,sample size, population\u2019s age, course of treatment, interventions, outcomes, outcomedefinition/measurement instruments, measurement time frame. Any disagreement was resolved bydiscussion.Merging outcomes and grouping under outcome domainsTwo researchers (RQ and CZ) merged the overlapping outcomes according to the definitionof outcomes independently. If the researchers did not provide definition of outcome, theydiscussed and achieved consensus if necessary. For example, \u201cPaO2/FiO2\u201d, \u201coxygenation index\u201d,\u201coxygen index\u201d, \u201cthe difference of PaO2/FiO2 between two groups\u201d were aggregated as\u201cPaO2/FiO2\u201d. Many protocols presented composite outcomes. If definitions were provided, or allof the single outcomes in the composite one can be measured in one test, it was listed in the review.If a single outcome which belongs to a composite outcome was reported by one or more protocols,the composite outcome was removed from the review. But when we conduct Delphi survey infurther research, the composite outcome will be list to consult the participants\u2019 opinion.After the original outcomes were aggregated, two researchers (RQ and CZ) groupedindividual outcomes into the appropriate outcome domain together and achieved consensus. Thetaxonomy of outcome domains were developed by the researchers from COMET initiative [7].The COVID-19 is highly infectious. For the safety of patients and public, they were notThe results were analysed by descriptive analysis.involved in the design or planning of the study.In this review, a total of 160 protocols from 19 different clinical trials registry platforms weresearched. After reading titles and study details, 63 non-relevant or ineligible study protocols wereexcluded. In the end, 97 eligible study protocols were included fromChiCTR andClinicalTrials.gov. The searching results and inclusion numbers were shown in Table 1.In the included protocols, 34 clinical trials were for TCM therapy and 63 clinical trials were forwestern medicine therapy. All of clinical trials will be conducted in China. These clinical trialsinclude 75 RCTs (53 for western medicine and 22 for TCM medicine) and 22 non-RCTs (10 forwestern medicine and 12 for TCM medicine). The first registered clinical trial for westernmedicine was on January 23, 2020, while the first registered clinical trial for TCM medicine wason January 27, 2020. The general characteristics of the included protocols are shown in table 2 andAccording to the information of primary sponsor, we found that the clinical trials were registeredfrom 13 different provinces of China. Researchers from Hubei province registered more clinicaltrials (31/97, 31.96%) than researchers from other provinces.
