Email: chenjp@giabr.gd.cnThe outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, China hasresulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showedthat 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) could be of bat origin but involve other potentialintermediate hosts. In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronavirusesidentified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed thatpangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directlyfrom the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host ofBetacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance ofcoronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum ofcoronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures ofhumans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronavirusesfrom wild animals to humans.        In December 2019, there was an outbreak of pneumonia with an unknown causein Wuhan, Hubei province in China, with an epidemiological link to the HuananSeafood Wholesale Market, which is a live animal and seafood market. Clinicalpresentations of this disease greatly resembled viral pneumonia. Through deepsequencing on the lower respiratory tract samples of patients, a novel coronavirusnamed the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified [        To effectively control the diseases and prevent new spillovers, it is critical toidentify the animal origin of this newly emerging coronavirus. In this wet market ofWuhan, high viral loads were reported in the environmental samples. However,variety of animals, including some wildlife, were sold on this market, and the numberand species were very dynamics. It remains unclear which animal initiated the firstinfections.        Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and aregenetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. The former two genera primarily infectmammals, whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds [                Approximate 30-thousand-base genome of coronavirus codes up to 11 proteins,and the surface glycoprotein S protein binds to receptors on the host cell, initiatingvirus infection. Different coronaviruses can use distinct host receptors due tostructural variations in the receptor binding domains of the virus S protein.SARS-CoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as one of the mainreceptors [7] with CD209L as an alternative receptor [8], whereas MERS-CoV usesdipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the primary receptor.Computational modeling analyses suggested that, similar to SARS-CoV, the2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as the receptor [        Not soon after the release of the 2019-nCoV genome, a scientist released a fullgenome of a coronavirus, Bat-CoV-RaTG13, from bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), which iscolonized in Yunan province, nearly 2,000 km away from Wuhan. Bat-CoV-RaTG13was 96% identical at the whole genome level to the 2019-nCoV, suggesting the2019-nCoV, could be of bat origin [10]. However, with rare direct contacts betweensuch bats and humans, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it seems to be morelikely that the spillover of 2019-nCoV to humans from another intermediate hostrather than directly from bats.coronavirus from two groups of sick pangolins and the 2019-nCoV and to assesswhether pangolins could be a potential intermediate host for the 2019-nCoV.In March of 2019, we detected Betacoronavirus in three animals from two sets ofsmuggling Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) (n=26) intercepts by Guangdongcustoms [11]. All three animals suffered from serious respiratory diseases and failedto be rescued by the Guangdong Wildlife Rescue Center [11] (Table S2). Throughmetagenomic sequencing and de novo assembling, we recovered 38 contigs rangingfrom 380 to 3,377 nucleotides, and the nucleotide sequence identities among thecontigs from these three samples were 99.54%. Thus, we pooled sequences from threesamples and assembled the draft genome of this pangolin origin coronavirus, so calledpangolin-CoV-2020 (Accession No.: GWHABKW00000000), which wasapproximately 29,380 nucleotides, with approximately 84% coverage of the virusgenome (Figure 1a).Strikingly, genomic analyses suggested the pangolin-CoV-2020 has a highidentity with both 2019-nCoV and Bat-CoV-RaTG13, the proposed origin of the2019-nCoV [10] (Figure 1b; Figure 1c). The nucleotide sequence identity betweenpangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV was 90.23% whereas the protein sequenceidentities for individual proteins can be up to 100% (Table S3; Table S4). Thenucleotide sequence between pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 90.15%Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 96.12% (Table 1).The nucleotide sequence identities of the surface glycoprotein Spike (S) proteingenes between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV was 82.21%, and theBat-CoV-RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV shared the highest sequence identity of 92.59%(Table 1). There was a low similarity of 72.63% between the S genes ofpangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV. Nucleotide sequence analyses suggested the Sgene was relatively more genetic diverse in the S1 region than the S2 region (Figure2a). Furthermore, the S proteins of pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV had asequence identity of 89.78% (Table 2), sharing a very conserved receptor bindingmotif (RBM) (Figure S1), which is more conserved than in Bat-CoV-RaTG13. Theseresults support that pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV, and SARS-CoV could allshare the same receptor ACE2. The presence of highly identical RBMs inpangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV means that this motif was likely already presentin the virus before jumping to humans. However, it is interesting that bothpangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 lack a S1/S2 cleavage site (~680-690 aa)whereas 2019-nCoV possess (Figure S1).Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the S genes of pangolin-CoV-2020,2019-nCoV and three bat origin coronaviruses (Bat-CoV-RaTG13,Bat-CoV-CVZXC21, and Bat-Cov-CVZC45) were genetically more similar to eachother than other viruses in the same family (Figure 2b). The S gene ofBat-CoV-RaTG13 was genetically closer to each other than pangolin-CoV-2020,for the RdRp gene and other genes (Figure 3a-d; Figure S2a-h). At the whole genomiclevel, the 2019-nCoV is also genetically closer to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 thanpangolin-CoV-2020 (Figure 1c).In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sickpangolins and our results showed that a pangolin coronavirus (pangolin-CoV-2020) isgenetically associated with both 2019-nCoV and a group of bat coronaviruses. Thereis a high sequence similarity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV. However,phylogenetic analyses did not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from thepangolin-CoV-2020.It is of interest that the genomic sequences for coronaviruses detected from twobatches of pangolins intercepted by two different customs at different dates were allbe associated with bat coronaviruses. The reads from the third pangolin acquired inJuly of 2019 were relatively less abundant than the two from the first two pangolinsamples acquired in March of 2019. Although we are unclear whether these twobatches of smuggling and exotic pangolins were from the same origin, our resultsindicated that pangolin be a natural host for Betacoronaviruses, which could beenzootic in pangolins. All three exotic pangolins detected with Betacoronaviruses inthis study were very sick with serious respiratory diseases and failed to be rescued.However, these pangolins were very stressful in the transportation freight when beingflora in the respiratory tracts of pangolins. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of thiscoronavirus to pangolin remains to be studied.Compared to the genomic sequence of pangolin-CoV-2020 we assembled in thisstudy, phylogenetic trees suggested that a bat origin coronavirus (i.e.,Bat-CoV-RaTG13) was more genetically close to the 2019-nCoV at both individualgene and genomic sequence level. Interestingly, the cleavage site between S1 and S2at the 2019-nCoV had multiple insertions (i.e. PRRA), compared to that ofBat-CoV-RaTG13 and pangolin-CoV-2020, which were similar. Thus, although it isclear that 2019-nCoV is of bat origin, it is likely another intermediate host could beinvolved in emergence of the 2019-nCoV.        The S protein of coronaviruses bind to host receptors via receptor-bindingdomains (RBDs), and plays an essential role in initiating virus infection anddetermines host tropism [                The host range of animal origin coronaviruses was promiscuous [12]. It is criticalto determine the natural reservoir and the host range of coronaviruses, especially theirand MERS caused serious outbreaks in humans, lead to thousands of deaths [        In summary, this study suggested pangolins be a natural host of Betacoronavirus,with an unknown potential to infect humans. However, our data do not support the2019-nCoV evolved directly from the pangolin-CoV.identify pathogens causing wildlife diseases. In 2019, we were involved in two eventsof pangolin rescues, one involved with 21 smuggling pangolins in March and thesecond with 6 smuggling pangolins in July. From those pangolins failed to be rescued,we collected samples from different tissues and subjected for metagenomic analyses.Through viral metagenomics analyses of lower respiratory tract samples from thesepangolins, we detected coronavirus in three individual animals [11]. Two of theseanimals were from the first batch of Malayan pangolins intercepted by Meizhou,Yangjiang, and Jiangmen customs, and the third one was from the second batch in afreight being transported from Qingyuan to Heyuan. The RNA samples from thesethree individuals were subjected to deep sequencing. To determine the read abundanceof coronaviruses in each sample, we mapped clean reads without ribosomes and hostsequences to an in-house virus reference data separated from the GenBanknon-redundant nucleotide database.Genomic assembly and sequence analyses. After examining the high similarityamong the samples from three animals, to maximize the coverage of the virus genome,clean reads from three animals were pooled together and de novo assembled usingMEGAHIT v1.2.9 [19]. The assembled contigs were used as references for mappingthose the rest unmapped reads using Salmon v0.14.1 [20], and multiple rounds wereimplemented to maximize the mapping (Table S2).A total of 38 contigs were identified to be highly similar to the 2019-nCoVSSPACE v3.0 were used to fill gaps and draft pangolin-CoV-2020 genome wasconstructed with ABACAS v1.3.1 (http://abacas.sourceforge.net/) [21, 22, 23].Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using CLUSTAL Ov1.2.4 [24].Simplot analyses were conducted with SimPlot v3.5.1 to determine the sequencesimilarity among 2019-nCoV (MN908947.3), pangolin-CoV-2020, Bat-CoV-RaTG13(MN996532.1), and SARS-CoV (AY395003.1) at both the genomic sequence leveland at individual gene level [25]. Sequence identity was calculated utilizingp-diatance in MEGA v10.1.7 [26].Phylogenetic analyses. We downloaded 44 full-length genome sequences ofcoronaviruses isolated from different hosts from the public database (Table S1).Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on their whole genome sequences,encoding ORFs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp gene), the receptorbinding protein spike protein (S gene), small envelope protein (E gene), as well as allother gene sequences were conducted utilizing Mrbayes [27] with 50,000,000generations and the 25% of the generations as burnin. Best models were determinedby jModeltest v2.1.7 [28]. Then, all the trees were visualized and exported as vectordiagrams with FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).Acknowledgements: We thank the De-Chun Lin and Tao Jin from Magigene Biotech.and Hanghui Kong from South China Botanical Garden support for bioinformaticssystem maintenance project from National Forestry and Grassland Administration(2019072), GDAS Special Project of Science and Technology Development (grantnumber 2020GDASYL-20200103090, 2018GDASCX-0107),Guangzhou ScienceTechnology and Innovation Commission (grant number 201804020080), NaturalScience Foundation of China (grant number 31972847), Guangzhou science andtechnology project (grant number 2019001), and 2019-nCoV wildlife origin projectfrom Guangdong department of science and technology.Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratorysyndrome.

However,variety of animals, including some wildlife, were sold on this market, and the numberand species were very dynamics. Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and aregenetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. At the whole genomiclevel, the 2019-nCoV is also genetically closer to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 thanpangolin-CoV-2020 (Figure 1c).In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sickpangolins and our results showed that a pangolin coronavirus (pangolin-CoV-2020) isgenetically associated with both 2019-nCoV and a group of bat coronaviruses. Thereis a high sequence similarity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV. However,phylogenetic analyses did not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from thepangolin-CoV-2020.It is of interest that the genomic sequences for coronaviruses detected from twobatches of pangolins intercepted by two different customs at different dates were allbe associated with bat coronaviruses. The reads from the third pangolin acquired inJuly of 2019 were relatively less abundant than the two from the first two pangolinsamples acquired in March of 2019. Although we are unclear whether these twobatches of smuggling and exotic pangolins were from the same origin, our resultsindicated that pangolin be a natural host for Betacoronaviruses, which could beenzootic in pangolins. From those pangolins failed to be rescued,we collected samples from different tissues and subjected for metagenomic analyses.
