This outbreak wasconrfimed to be caused by severe acuterespiratory syndrome corona virus 2(SARS\u00ad CoV\u00ad 2), belonging to the samefamily of viruses responsible for severeacute respiratory syndrome (SARS)and Middle East respiratory syndrome(MERS).1 The SARS epidemic in 2003was controlled through numerousmeasures in China. One effectivestrategy was the establishment of feverclinics for triaging patients. Based onour first\u00ad hand experience in dealingwith the present outbreak in Wuhan, wehave established the following clinicalstrategies in adult fever clinics (gfiure).Patients can be afebrile in theearly stages of infection, with onlychills and respiratory symptoms.High temperature is not a generalpresentation. Elevated C\u00ad reactiveprotein (CRP) is an important factorof 2019 novel coronavirus disease(COVID\u00ad 19; formally known as2019 \u00ad nCoV) and impaired immunity,characterised by lymphopenia, is anessential characteristic. Therefore, inafebrile patients (temperature <37\u00b73\u00b0C)without dyspnoea, we recommendmeasurements of complete bloodcount and CRP. Subsequently, if thelymphocyte concentration is \u22651100/\u03bcL,home care with self\u00ad isolation is advised.Oral azithromycin or amoxicillin can beprescribed (measure 1, gfiure).Chest CT is helpful (appendix)and is more sensitive than x\u00ad ray inidentifying viral pneumonia. Imagingof patients with COVID\u00ad 19 initiallyrevealed characteristic patchy infil\u00adtration, progressing to large ground\u00adglass opacities that often presentbilaterally. The differential diagnosisfor viral pneumonia includes respir\u00adatory syncytial virus and influenzavirus. Febrile patients (temperature\u226537\u00b73\u00b0C) should have both chest CTand respiratory viral tests. Patientswith normal chest CT scans canfollow measure 1 interventions. If theconsensus is bacterial community\u00adacquired pneumonia (CAP), thenstandard clinical protocols are followed.Once the patient's temperature returnsto normal, they are transferred toundesignated hospitals or dischargedhome (measure 2, gfiure).Patients diagnosed with viral pneu\u00admonia require isolation and SARS\u00ad CoV\u00ad 2tests (measure 3). Systemic and localrespiratory defense mechanisms arecompromised, resulting in bacterial Published Onlineco\u00ad infection if early, eefctive antiviral February 13, 2020https://doi.org/10.1016/treatment is not started. Empirical S2213 \u00ad 2600(20)30071 \u00ad 0therapy consists of oral moxioflxacin orlevofloxacin (consider tolerance) andarbidol. Arbidol is approved in Chinaand Russia for inuflenza treatment. In \u00advitro studies showed that arbidol hadinhibitory effects on SARS.2 Patientstesting positive for SARS\u00ad CoV\u00ad 2 aretransferred to designated hospitals.Measure 11) Home care2) Oral azithromycinor amoxicillinAbsolutelymphocyte counts<1100 \u03bc/LYesOtherCAPYesMeasure 21) Regular CAPtreatment2) Transfer toundesignatedhospital ordischarge homeChill, sore throat, or coughComplete blood count, CRPDyspnoeaor hypoxia(SpO2 <93%)NoFever,\u226537\u00b73 C\u00b0YesChest CT scan, detectionof respiratory virusViralpneumoniaYesMeasure 31) Isolatedobservation2) SARS-CoV-2 test3) Respiratoryquinolones +arbidolSARS-CoV-2positiveYesMeasure 5Transfer todesignated hospitalSpO2<93%Measure 41) Supplementaloxygen2) Admission to anisolation ward3) Arbidol +nemonoxacinor linezolidSee Online for appendixDyspnoea and hypoxaemia suggestsevere pneumonia and are suspiciouseven in afebrile patients. If presentingwith dyspnoea and hypoxia (oxygensaturation [SpO2 ] <93%), prescribesupplemental oxygen, admit to anisolation ward, and assess transferrisk. If patients are deteriorating withmeasure 3 interventions, the coretreatment principle we recommendis antiviral plus antipneumococcusplus anti\u00ad Staphylococcus aureus(measure 4, figure). Coverage forStreptococcus pneumoniae a n dS aureus is important as co\u00ad infectionincreases the likelihood of severeillness.3 High\u00ad dose nemonoxacin(750 mg once daily) and linezolid iseffective against S pneumoniae andStaphylococcus aureus (includingmethicillin\u00ad resistant Staphylococcusaureus [MRSA]).Glucocorticoids are not a routinetreatment.4 In emergency cases, such asSpO2 <90%, dexamethasone 5\u201310 mgor methylprednisolone 40\u201380 mg isgiven intravenously before transfer.High\u00ad throughput oxygen therapy orcontinuous positive airway pressure(CPAP) ventilation are both efectivesupportive therapies and target bloodSpO2 should be 88\u201390%. Invasivemechanical ventilation is used as a lastresort.Special considerations are givenfor elderly, immunocompromised,and pregnant patients. Olderpatients (>65 years) and immuno\u00adcompromised patients should betreated as moderate or severe casesin the initial assessment. Infectionsin pregnant women might progressrapidly and timely clinical decisionsare crucial to provide pregnantwomen with options, such asinduction, anaesthesia, and surgery.Consultation with an obstetricspecialist is recommended anddepending on the condition of themother, termination of the pregnancyis a consideration.Home care and isolation can relievethe burden on health\u00ad care providersof fever clinics. We used this strategyin Wuhan in response to the largevolume of patients arriving at healthcare centres but do not recommend itfor other regions where each suspectedcase can be appropriately isolatedand monitored in a health setting.Inappropriate home care can be lifethreatening for patients and be adetriment to public health.5Many factors contributed to dev\u00adeloping our clinical algorithm in Wuhanduring the early outbreak period. Duringthis time, the inuflx of patients to feverclinics substantially outweighed thenumber of physicians. Inpatient carewas unsafe due to potential cross\u00adinfection and supplementary resourceswere not ready. Applying and waitingfor results of an SARS\u00ad CoV\u00ad 2 test wastime consuming just after the outbreakand did not aid clinical decision making.We made trade\u00ad osf betw een infectioncontrol and standard medical principlesand adapted the protocol as moreinformation and resources becameavailable. We hope our experience willserve as guidance for other fever clinicsand future cases.We declare no competing interests.\u2020Contributed equally1 Huang C, Wang Y, Li X, et al.
