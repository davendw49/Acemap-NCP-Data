Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection efficiency for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore's capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, given all countries had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify country likely detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% HPDI 22% 67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the", "text": "outbreak.During the outbreak of a new virus SARS-Cov2 and its associated disease COVID-19, infection in travelershas been used to estimate the risk of infection in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the epicenter of theoutbreak\u200b1\u200b. This approach is similar to that used for the the 2009 influenza pandemic where infections intourists returning from Mexico were used to estimate the time-specific risk of infection (incidence orcumulative incidence) with the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza strain in Mexico (or parts thereof). The ideawas that surveillance for the novel virus was not intense during the early days of the pandemic in Mexico,the source country, and that detection would be far more sensitive in travelers, who would be screenedwhen returning home as a means of preventing introductions of cases into destination countries \u200b2,3\u200b.Reports that health systems in Wuhan are overwhelmed and many cases are not being counted have led tothe use of outgoing traveler data to estimate the time-specific risk of infection in Wuhan\u200b4\u200b. This estimate, inturn, has been used to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection by a certain date in Wuhan, and fromthere (assuming exponential growth and no appreciable depletion of susceptibles) the cumulative numberof cases. An important assumption underlies this calculation: detection of cases in the destination countryhas been 100% sensitive and specific, whether they are detected at the airport (prevalent cases withsymptoms) or later after arrival at their destination (cases that were incubating during travel).Here we consider the extent to which the assumption of 100% sensitivity is justified. We conclude that theassumption is strongly inconsistent with observed data, resulting in potentially substantial underestimates ofprevalence in Hubei and corresponding overestimates of case-severity measures that are normalised bycase counts.We previously showed that there was variability between locations in the world in the relationship betweenthe number of travelers from Wuhan to each location and the number of imported cases detected in thatlocation. On average for countries in the top quartile of the Global Health Security Index\u200b5\u200b (indicatingpresumed high surveillance capacity) one imported case reported over the period 8th January to 4thFebruary was associated with each additional 14 passengers/day historical travel volume\u200b6\u200b. However therewas variation around this average. Among countries with substantial travel volume, Singapore showed thehighest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume, a ratio of one case per 5 daily travelers.Singapore is historically known for exceptionally sensitive detection of cases, for example in SARS\u200b7\u200b, andhas had extremely detailed case reporting during the COVID-19 outbreak\u200b8\u200b.We included \u200bn\u200b=191 locations, from a total of 195 worldwide locations, reflecting mainly countries withouttaking any position on territorial claims and excluding mainland China (the epicentre of the epidemic) andHong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, locations where imported and locally transmitted cases were notdisaggregated. Data on imported cases aggregated by location were obtained from the WHO technicalreport dated 4th February 2020\u200b1\u200b (a zero case count was assumed for all locations not listed). We used casecounts up to the 4th February, because after this date the number of exported cases from Hubei provincedrops rapidly\u200b1\u200b, likely due to the Hubei-wide lockdowns. We defined imported cases as those with knowntravel history from China (of those, 83% had travel history from Hubei province, and 17% from unknownlocations in China\u200b1\u200b). Estimates on daily air travel volume were obtained from Lai et al.\u200b9\u200b. They are based onhistorical (February 2018) data from the International Air Travel Association and include estimates for the27 locations that are most connected to Wuhan. They capture the daily average number of passengerstraveling via direct and indirect flight itineraries from Wuhan to destinations outside of China. For all 164locations not listed by Lai et al.\u200b9\u200b, we set the daily air travel volume to 1.5 passengers per day, which is onehalf of the minimum reported by Lai et al. Surveillance capacity was assessed using the Global HealthSecurity Index\u200b5\u200b, which is an assessment of health security across 195 countries agreeing to theInternational Health Regulations (IHR [2005]). Specifically, we use the second category of the index, EarlyDetection and Reporting Epidemics of Potential International Concern, henceforth referred to as simply theGHS\u200b2 index. We order the \u200bn\u200b locations according to their GHS\u200b2 index and classify locations with GHS\u200b2 index\u200b \u200b \u200babove the 80th percentile as high surveillance locations, those with GHS\u200b2 index below the 20th percentile\u200bas low surveillance locations, with all others classified as locations with intermediate surveillance.We consider the detection of 18 cases by 4th February 2020 in Singapore\u200b1\u200b to be a gold standard ofnear-perfect detection, and estimate the probability of detection in other countries relative to Singaporeaccording to the following model. We assume that across \u200bi\u200b = 1,...,\u200bn\u200b worldwide locations where \u200bn\u200b=191, theobserved case count follows a Poisson distribution, and that the expected case count is linearlyproportional to the daily air travel volume and a random variable, \u03b8level , reflecting the probability ofdetecting cases relative to Singapore:where \u200bY\u200bi\u200b denotes the reported case count in the \u200bi\u200b-th location, \u200b\u03bb\u200bi\u200b denotes the expected case count in the \u200bi\u200b-thlocation, \u200b\u03b2\u200b denotes the regression coefficient, \u200bx\u200bi\u200b denotes the daily air travel volume of the \u200bi\u200b-th location, and\u03b8level denotes a detection probability relative to Singapore whose index is one. We assume that there arethree different levels: low, medium and high. For each \u03b8level \u2208 {\u03b8low, \u03b8med, \u03b8high} we assign a uniform priorover [0,1], and for log(\u200b\u03b2\u200b )\u200b \u200b we assign a weakly informative Normal prior with mean zero and standarddeviation 50. Having fit the model (see details below) we approximate the distribution of the averagedetection probability, \u03b8global , by transforming draws from the posterior distributions of \u03b8low, \u03b8med, \u03b8high .Specifically, we take the weighted mean of the posterior draws of \u03b8low, \u03b8med, \u03b8high for \u200bi\u200b = 2,...n whereweights are proportional to daily air travel volume, \u200bx\u200b i\u200b. Exclusion of Singapore (\u200bi\u200b =1) enables the estimation ofthe global detection probability relative to Singapore. Conversely, 1/\u03b8global is an estimate of the multiplier ofthe case count that could have been detected globally under a capacity equivalent to that of Singapore. Wediscuss the mean and 95% highest posterior density interval (HPDI) of the numerical approximation of theposterior distribution of \u03b8global , as well as the mean and 95% HPDI of the numerical approximation of theposterior distribution of 1/\u03b8global . Note that the latter two are not reciprocals of the former two because theinverse of a mean is not equal to the mean of the inverse, and similarly for the HPDIs.We fit this model using Stan software (v2.19.1)\u200b10\u200b and we draw 80,000 samples from the posteriorusing four independent chains (20,000 samples each), each with a burn-in of 500. Diagnostic plots of theMCMC sampler for each inferred variables ( \u03b8low, \u03b8med, \u03b8high and \u03b2 ) are shown in \u200bSupplementary Figure 1\u200b.All analyses are fully reproducible with the code available online(https://github.com/c2-d2/detect_prob_corona2019).We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore\u2019scapacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases,could have been detected, given all countries had the same detection capacity as Singapore, which are 1.8(95% CI 0.5 - 3.4) undetected cases per detected case. The ability to detect imported cases among highsurveillance countries is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37%(95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%).the posterior distributions of \u03b8low, \u03b8med, \u03b8high . The top panel is a density plot of \u03b8global . HPDI: highestposterior density interval.In this paper, we have aimed to test a critical assumption underlying the estimation of incidence atthe epicentre of the SARS-Cov2 outbreak: that the capacity for detection of international imported cases is100% sensitive and specific across locations. While there is no reason to doubt specificity of detection toour knowledge, we tested the assumption of perfect sensitivity. Specifically, we regressed cumulative casesto Wuhan-to-location air travel volume considering Singapore to have the greatest detection capacity andestimating the relative underdetection compared to Singapore in the remaining locations indexed \u200bi\u200b=2,...,\u200bn\u200b.        We estimated that detection of exported cases from Wuhan worldwide is 38% (95% HPDI22%-64%) as sensitive as it has been in Singapore. Put another way, this implies that the true number ofcases in travelers is at least 2.8x (95% HPDI 1.5x - 4.4x) the number that has been detected. Equivalently,for each detected case there are at least 1.8 (95% CI 0.5,3.4) undetected cases. If the model is correct, thisis an upper bound on the detection frequency because (1) Singapore\u2019s detection is probably not 100%efficient. Singapore had as of 12 February 2020 eight documented cases of COVID-19 transmission forwhich there were no known epidemiological links to China or other known cases\u200b11\u200b, implying that importedcases in Singapore may have gone undetected (although it is not certain that these imports came fromWuhan or China, and links may still be found). (        These findings have two important implications for public health response to SARS-CoV2. First, thisfinding has implications for approaches to case burden and severity estimation which use cases in travelersto impute cases in Wuhan, which are then compared (for severity estimation) against deaths in Wuhan. Ifthe true number of cases in travelers is higher than previously thought, this implies more cases in Wuhanand a larger denominator, resulting in reduced estimates of severity compared to estimates assumingperfect detection in travelers. Future studies should account for our evolving understanding of detectioncapacity when estimating case numbers and severity in source population on the basis of traveler casenumbers. Second, the scenario where the virus has been imported from Wuhan and remained undetectedin various worldwide locations is a plausible one, at least until the city lockdown (23rd January 2020), andone might speculate that detection capacity remained limited beyond this period as travelers infectedelsewhere in China continued to leave China. Based on our model, the risk of undetected circulationcorrelates both with air travel connectivity and (inversely) to outbreak detection capacity, but could havehappened in virtually any location worldwide leading to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission,which may be an early stage of a global pandemic.1.
