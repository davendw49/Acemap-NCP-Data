On Jan 30, 2020, WHO large part on the unanswered questiondeclared a public health emergency as to whether individuals are infectiousof international concern. \u201cThe main before their symptoms manifest. \u201cWereason for this declaration is not do not understand the disease pyramidbecause of what is happening in China, properly\u201d, adds Whitworth. \u201cThere arebut because of what is happening in people who are asymptomatic, peopleother countries\u201d, commented WHO who are infected with mild disease,Director-General Tedros Adhanom. people infected with severe disease, andthen the people who die. It looks like15\u201320% of conrfimed cases are severelyill, and something like 3% have died. Butwe have no idea how this tfis in with thetotal number of cases\u201d. Such a mortalityrate would place the novel coronavirussomewhere between seasonal inuflenzaand SARS (severe acute respiratorysyndrome). But it remains possible thata full reckoning of the disease burdenwould cause the mortality rate to fall inline with that of seasonal inuflenza.\u201cAt the moment it looks like, inChina at least, the virus is spreadingrapidly and infecting lots of people\u201d,explains Tom Solomon (University ofLiverpool, Liverpool, UK). \u201cThe vastmajority are asymptomatic. If a largenumber of people become infectedand have very mild, or no, symptoms,then the virus spreads through thepopulation without causing too muchharm.\u201d If that proves to be the case,2019-nCoV would turn out to be atypical coronavirus. \u201cIf the proportionwith severe and fatal disease is high,then this is when we have a realproblem on our hands\u201d, cautionsSolomon. \u201cThis would mean the novelcoronavirus is more like SARS was.\u201dChina has moved quickly to containthe outbreak. Live animal marketsthroughout the country have beensuspended. Wuhan has been put onlock-down. Trains and flights outof the city have been cancelled andmost private cars have been banned.Long-distance bus services have beensuspended from Wuhan and a handfulof other provinces and municipalities,including Beijing, and public gatheringshave been restricted. Matters have beencomplicated by the Chinese New Year,which started on Jan 25. Under normalcircumstances, some 3 billion tripswould take place within China duringthe week\u2019s festivities that follow theNew Year. According to Wuhan\u2019s mayor,5 million residents had already left thecity by the time the quarantine wasannounced. The central governmenthas instructed schools and universitiesnot to re-open immediately after theNew Year celebrations.Whitworth welcomed the Chineseresponse. \u201cThe real battleground is inChina; we have not seen many casesoutside the country\u201d, he said. \u201cIt takesdraconian public health measures tostop a virus like this from spreading,and China is in a position to take suchmeasures. If they cannot control thevirus there, it is going to be very hardto control it if it does start to spreadelsewhere.\u201d", "ref_list": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "Published Online On Dec 31, 2019, China alerted WHO to More information on the clinical\npresFebruary 3, 2020 several cases of pneumonia associated entation of infection with 2019-nCoV\nSh2t2t1p3s-:/2/6d0o0i.o(2rg0/)1300.015061-64/ with an unknown virus.
