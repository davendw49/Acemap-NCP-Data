It has beendesignated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC).Object: This study predicts the effectiveness of VEC enduring and after itsimplementation.Method: We applied a simple susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovery model to data of patientswith symptoms in Japan during 14 January to VEC introduction and after VECintroduction to 8 March. We adjusted the reporting delay in the latest few days.Results: Results suggest that the basic reproduction number, R0, before VEC introducedas 2.29 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was [2.19, 2.37] and the effectivereproduction number, Rv, after VEC introduced as 1. 99; its 95% CI was [1.71,2.23].Discussion and Conclusion: No significant effect of VEC was observed.The initial case of COVID-19 in Japan was that of a patient returning from Wuhan,China who showed symptoms on 3 January, 2020. Subsequently, as of 13 March, 2020,714 cases were announced, including asymptomatic or those infected at abroad incountries such as China but excluding or those infected on a large cruise ship, theSports and entertainment events were canceled in Japan for two weeks from 26February to 13 March according to a government advisory. At the same time, it wasadvised that small business and private meetings be cancelled voluntarily. The policy isdesignated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Moreover, since 3 March, almost allschools have been closed to control the spread until early April. Althoughschoolchildren are not of pestiferous age, the policy effects remain unknown. Thesepolicies must be evaluated as soon as possible. If the effective reproduction number, Rvunder these measures is less than one, the outbreak can be contained. Alternatively,even given a low R0 before these measures, if it was greater than one, it might prolongthe outbreak. Nevertheless, one could expect to prevent some fatal cases over time byeasing burdens on medical resources or developing a vaccine. The entire course of theoutbreak might be altered if these measures were able to reduce infectiousnessconsiderably. Therefore, evaluation of these measures must be thorough when thesemeasures are commenced, continued, and ceased. The present study was conducted toevaluate VEC before VEC is cancelled so as to contribute government\u2019s decisionmaking whether VEC will be continued or ceased.We applied a simple susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovery (SIR) model [2] to the dataassuming an incubation period following its empirical distribution in the early stage ofthe outbreak in Japan. Experiences of Japanese people living in Wuhan until theoutbreak provide information related to mild cases because complete laboratorysurveillance was administered for them. During January 29 \u2013 February 17, 2020, 829Japanese people returned to Japan from Wuhan. All had received a test to detectCOVID-19; of them, 14 were found to be positive for COVID-19 [3]. Of those 14, 10Japanese people had exhibited mild symptoms; the other 4 showed no symptom as ofFebruary 25. Moreover, two Japanese residents of Wuhan exhibited severe symptoms:one was confirmed as COVID-19. The other died, although no fatal case was confirmedas COVID-19 by testing. In addition, two Japanese residents of Wuhan with mildsymptoms were refused re-entry to Japan even though they had not been confirmed asinfected. If one assumes that the Japanese fatal case in Wuhan and that the two rejectedre-entrants were infected with COVID-19, then 2 severe cases, 12 mild cases, and 4asymptomatic cases were found to exist among these Japanese residents of Wuhan. Wetherefore apply these proportions to the simulation.Assuming that the power of infectivity among severe patients and mild patientswere equal among the asymptomatic cases, half of the symptomatic cases can beassumed. This assumption about relative infectiousness among asymptomatic casescompared with symptomatic cases was also assumed in simulation studies for influenza[4\u20138]. We sought R0 to fit the number of patients during 14 January \u2013 28 February andto minimize the sum of absolute values of discrepancies among the reported numbersand the fitted values. Its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the 10000iterations of bootstrapping for empirical distribution.We used data of the community outbreak of patients with COVID-19 who showedany symptom in Japan for 14 January \u2013 13 March, 2020. We excluded some patientswho had returned from China, and who were presumed to be infected persons from theDiamond Princess. They were presumed to be not community-acquired in Japan. Duringthis period, 544 cases with onset dates occurred.        Published information about COVID-19 patients with symptoms from the Ministryof Labour, Health and Welfare (MLHW), Japan was usually adversely affected withsome delay caused by uncertainty during onset to visiting a doctor or in the timing of aphysician\u2019s suspicion of COVID-19. Therefore, published data of patients must beadjust at least a few days. To adjust it, we applied the following regression. We denoteXt-k|t as the number of patients whose onset date was t-k published on day t. Thedependent variables are the degree of reporting delay, Xt-k-m|t / Xt-k-m|t-m, where k>min several m and k. Here, m denotes the difference of the publishing dates between thetwo published. Date t represents the publishing date of the latest publishing. Theexplanatory variables were 1/k, 1/m, and 1/km. The degree of reporting delay wasestimated as [estimated coefficient of constant term] + [estimated coefficient of 1/k]/k,when m was sufficiently large and time had passed. Therefore, this estimated degree ofreporting delay multiplied by the latest published data are expected to be predictions ofthe number of patients whose onset date was t-k. We used this adjusted number ofpatients in the latest few days including those after VEC was adopted. We used thepublished data on 2,5,6, and 9-14 March,2020 by MLHW[        First, we estimated R0 in Japan to fit the data of community outbreak before VECwas introduced. Then, using the adjusted data of patients, we estimated Rv after VECwas adopted. We discussed about Rv/R0 through its distribution. We used 5% assignificant level.All information used in the present study were published and thus there was noDuring 14 January \u2013 13 March in Japan, 640 community-acquired cases wereidentified for whom the onset date was published. Figure 1 showed the empiricaldistribution of incubation period among 62 cases whose exposed date and onset datewere published by MHLW. Its mode and median were six days and average was 6.74Figure 2 depicts the epidemic curves published at 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10 March. Fromthis information, we estimated the degree of reporting delay. Those results are presentedin Table 1. The table shows that 1/k, 1/m and 1/km are all significant. When m issufficiently large, the effects of 1/m and 1/km converge to zero. Therefore, the estimateddegree of reporting delay consists of the term of 1/k and a constant term. Based on theseresults, we predict the degrees of reporting delay as 19.3 for k=1, 9.64 for k=2, 6.42 fork=3, and so on.The value of R0 before VEC introduced was estimated as 2.29 with a 95%CI was[2.19, 2.37] and Rv, after VEC introduced as 2.03 and its 95% CI was [1.72, 2.32]. Theaverage and median of Rv/R0 were 0.88 and its 95% CI was [0.79, 1.05].We applied a simple SIR model including asymptomatic cases that had not beenincorporated into the model to date. An earlier study [9] estimated R0 for COVID-19 asUnfortunately, effectiveness of VEC was not observed even though itreducedResults demonstrated that VEC can reduce infectiousness of COVID-19 by 13%,but not significant. However, we have to note that the obtained results were just apreliminary evaluation, and thus it is not a conclusive evaluation. VEC had beenextended until March 19 on March 10. We hope that the present study contributegovernment\u2019s decision making for VEC.
