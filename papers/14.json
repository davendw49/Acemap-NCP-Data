Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from two Wuhan patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals patterns similar to the RNA editing pattern observed in the 2019-nCoV transcriptomes. Our results suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.", "text": "Emerging viral infections represent a threat to global health, and the recent outbreak of NovelCoronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan (China) exemplifies the risks (1,5        2). As viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, organisms evolved innate immune processes for101520the sensing and the restriction of viruses. Among the processes involved is RNA and DNA editingmediated by endogenous deaminases. Two different deaminase families are present in mammalianspecies: the ADARs target double stranded RNA (dsRNA) for deamination of Adenines intoInosines (A-to-I) (                To assess whether RNA editing could be involved in the response to 2019-nCoV infections, westarted from publicly available RNA sequencing datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids(BALF) obtained from patients diagnosed with Coronavirus Virus disease (COVID-2019). Whiletranscriptomic data for all samples could be aligned to the 2019-nCoV reference genome, thequality of the sequencing varied among samples, and only two samples had coverage and errorrates suitable for the identification of potentially edited sites (Supplementary Table 1). Wetherefore called the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using REDItools 2 only on the data fromthe two patients reported in Chen et al.

(E) Editing rate: SNV count and typeper gene after normalization by gene length and coverage.101520        The allelic fraction of the SNVs ranges between 1 and 5% (Fig. 1A) and there is a bias towardstransitions (Fig.1B). The number of transversions is compatible with the mutation rate observedin Coronaviruses (10-6/-7, 28). On the other hand, the bias towards transitions resembles the patternof SNVs observed in human transcriptomes (                C>T and G>A are the second main group of changes and could derive from APOBEC-mediatedC-to-U deamination. Contrary to A-to-I, C-to-U editing is a relatively rare phenomenon in thehuman transcriptome (                APOBECs (        SNVs are spread throughout the viral genome, with no apparent difference in distribution betweenA-to-I and C-to-U changes (Fig. 1C). Since ADARs and APOBECs target selectively dsRNA and5ssRNA, such distribution could derive from the presence at all times of RNA in a dynamic1015equilibrium between double-strandedness -when negative-sense RNA is being transcribed- andsingle-strandedness -when nascent RNA is released. Some areas seem to bear less SNVs, but thisis due to lower coverage.        Similarly, SNVs accumulate on most viral genes proportionally to gene length and sequencingdepth (Fig. 1D, E). Only exception is the ORF6 gene, which modulates interferon signaling (                Since APOBEC deaminases preferentially target cytosines within specific sequence contexts, weanalyzed the trinucleotide context of the SNVs. After normalization for the genomic context, noapparent bias is visible for A-to-I changes (Fig. 2A, B). On the other hand, C-to-U changespreferentially occur 3\u2019 to thymines and adenines, as logo alignment clearly points towards a patterncompatible with APOBEC1 deamination ([AU]C[AU] (Fig. 2B) (        trinucleotide contexteach trinucleotide context (5\u2019 to 3\u2019, with x indicating the edited position) after normalization bygenomic content. Frequencies are normalized on the frequency of each trinucleotide context across5the viral genome (see methods). B, Local sequence context for A-to-I and C-to-U edited sites inthe viral transcriptome.1.000.75We then aligned available Coronavirus genomes from Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV),Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to test whether RNA editing could beresponsible for some of the mutations acquired through evolution. Indeed, the genomic alignments5reveal that a substantial fraction of the mutations in all strains could derive from C-to-U andA-toI deamination (Fig. 3A, C, E) and that a pattern compatible with APOBEC-mediated editing existsalso in genomic C-to-U SNVs (Fig. 3B, D, F).1.000.75Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)sequence contextntntnt0 AC AG AT CA CG CT GA GC GT TA TC TGMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)sequence context0 AC AG AT CA CG CT GA GC GT TA TC TGSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus(SARS-CoV)sequence contexteach nucleotide change across 2019-nCoV (A), human-hosted MERS-CoV (C), and human-hosted(Fig. S2).101520        Considering the source of our analysis -metagenomic sequencing- we wonder whether the editingfrequencies we observe (~1%) reflect the levels of editing of the viral RNAs inside the cell. Theseare the same editing levels observed for most of the ADAR-edited sites in the human transcriptome(typically inside Alu sequences) (                With regards to APOBEC-mediated RNA editing, its detection in the viral transcriptomes isalready indicative, as this type of editing is almost undetectable in human tissues (        Since most of the APOBECs are unable to target RNA, the only well characterizedcytidinetargeting deaminase are APOBEC1, mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, andAPOBEC3A, whose physiological role is not clear. As with A-to-I editing, it will be important toassess the true extent of APOBEC RNA editing in infected cells.5The functional meaning of RNA editing in 2019-nCoV is yet to be understood: in other contexts,1015editing of the viral genome determines its demise or fuels its evolution. For DNA viruses, theselection is indirect, as genomes evolve to reduce potentially harmful editable sites (e.g. 12), butfor RNA viruses this pressure is even stronger, as RNA editing directly effects the geneticinformation and efficiently edited sites disappear.        Finally, this analysis is a first step in understanding the involvement of RNA editing in viralreplication, and it could lead to clinically relevant outcomes: (a) if these enzymes are relevant inthe host response to Coronavirus infection, a polymorphism quite common in the Chinesepopulation that inactivates APOBEC3A (        Materials and MethodsRNA sequencing data available from projects PRJNA601736 and PRJNA603194 weredownloaded from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) using the fastq-dump utilities from5the SRA-toolkit with the command line:prefetch -v SRR*** && fastq-dump --outdir /path_dir/ |--splitfiles /path_dir/SRR****.sraDetails of the sequencing runs are summarised in Table S1.10        We aligned the FASTQ files using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (                The command line for the alignment and the sorting with Samtools (                Somatic nucleotide variant (SNV) callingWe used RediTools2 (        The threshold we used to filter the SNVs is based on minimum coverage (20 reads) and on thenumber of supporting reads (at least 4 mutated reads).

Data manipulation and analysisR packages (        Normalization of SNV counts on gene length and sequencing depthHigher gene lengths lead to higher probability of being mutated; hence, to investigate RNA editing10enrichments on 2019-nCoV genes we normalized SNV raw counts on gene-length. Since SNV rawcounts correlate with sequencing depth (Fig. S4), we normalized SNV raw counts on genes\u2019average sequencing depth.Consequently, editing rate per gene has been calculated as follows:15Where N is the SNV raw count occurring in a specific viral gene, L is the gene length, and D is thesum of the sequencing depth of the two samples.=\u00d7Normalization of trinucleotide contextsThe analysis of the trinucleotide contexts was performed normalizing the mutated trinucleotidewithrespecttoitspresenceinthe2019-nCoVgenomeasfollows:  (%) =5where C is the count of SNVs occurring with a specific trinucleotide context, and G is the numberof times that trinucleotide context is present in the viral genome.Viral genomes alignments        The viral genomic sequences of MERS (taxid:1335626) and SARS (taxid:694009) were selected10on NCBI Virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) using the query: Host : HomoSapiens (human), taxid:9606; -Nucleotide Sequence Type: Complete.
