This ispparticularly relevant nowadays, as coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has rapidly spread fromiChina to countries where IBD are more prevalent and there is convincingrevidence thatCovid-19-mediated morbidity and mortality are higher in subjects with comorbidities. Theprimary objectives of this Viewpoint are to provide a focused overview of the factors andmechanisms by which the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARSaCoV-2) infects the cells and to illustrate the link between such determinants and the intestinalinflammation. We also provide clues about the reasons why the overall IBD population mighthave no increased risk to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the potential ofD26        Although the cause of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains unknown, mostexperts agree that the IBD-associated tissue damage is driven by an excessive immuneresponse against luminal bacteria arising in genetically-predisposed individuals as a result ofthe action of multiple environmental factors (                pisuM(                Why should IBD patients be at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2-induced infections?Coronaviruses bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), amonocarboxycpeptidase best known for cleaving several peptides within the renin-angiotensinsystem Aandother substrates (                Although the live SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in faeces (        tpircD26Another aspect relevant for the Covid-19 infection in IBD relates to the currentstherapy, as many patients are taking immunesuppressors (e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate) forinducing and maintaining remission as well as preventing IBD-aussociated complications. Thenuse of such compounds has been associated with increased risk of infections as they blockintracellular signals needed for the host to fight pathogens (17). On the other hand, it isnoteworthy that suppression of the effector cyMtokine driven-inflammatory response in IBD(e.g. using cytokine blockers) could be beneficial not only for dampening the ongoingemucosal inflammation but also for preventing Covid-19-driven pneumonia. Indeed, thetprofile of cytokines documented in patients with severe Covid-19 resembles that seen ininflamed intestine of IBD patients and during the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d syndrome, a life-threatingcondition charactecrized by hyper-activation of T cells and massive production of interleukin(IL)-2, IL-6, TNF, and interferon-\uf067\uf020\uf028\uf031\uf038\uf02d\uf032\uf030\uf029. Consistently, blockers of IL-1 or IL-6 have beenused with success in pathologies characterized by cytokine storm and preliminary evidencesupports the use of IL-6 receptor antagonists in the treatment of Covid-19-driven pneumonia(21).The overall available evidence suggests that IBD patients do not have increased risktodevelopandshouldstaymedications. Patients receivingimmunesuppressors should be carefully monitored for the occurrence of symptoms and/orsigns suggestive for Covid-19. Moreover, those patients over 60 years and/or withcomorbidities, which have been reported to have greater risk for Covid-19-inducedpneumonia (e.g. coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lung disease,cerebrovascular diseases), should stay at home and avoid public gatherings.piD26Downloadedfromhttps://academi.coup.com/eccojcc/advanceailtrceabstract/doi/10.1093/eccojccjj/aa061/5811674bygueston26March2020degradation of angiotensin ii with recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2:Prevention of angiotensin ii-dependent hypertension.
