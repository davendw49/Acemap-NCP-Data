In contrast, the severe acute respiratorysyndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-associatedcoronavirus (MERS-CoV) are transmitted from animals to humans and cause severe respiratorydiseases in afflicted human patients, SARS and MERS, respectively (2). SARS emerged in 2002in Guangdong province, China, and its subsequent global spread was associated with 8096 casesand 774 deaths (3, 4). The virus uses Chinese horseshoe bats as natural reservoir (5, 6) and istransmitted via intermediate hosts to humans. Thus, SARS-CoV was identified in Civet cats andraccoon dogs, which are sold as food sources in Chinese wet markets (7). No specific antiviralsor approved vaccines are available to combat SARS and the SARS pandemic in 2002/2003 wasstopped by conventional control measures, including travel restrictions and patient isolation.        In December 2019 a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubeiprovince, China (8-10). Initial infections occurred at Huanan seafood market, potentially due toanimal contact. Subsequently, human-to-human transmission occurred (11)and the disease rapidly spread within C                The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry into target cells. Entrydepends on S protein binding to a cellular receptor and on S protein priming by a cellularprotease. SARS-S engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as entry receptor (14) and717273747576777879808182838485868788899091929394employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming (15-17). TheSARSS/ACE2 interface has been elucidated and the efficiency of ACE2 usage was found to be a keydeterminant of SARS-CoV transmissibility (6, 18). SARS-S und 2019-nCoV-S share ~76%amino acid identity.                Replication-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing coronavirus Sproteins faithfully reflect key aspects of coronavirus host cell entry (19). We employed VSVpseudotypes bearing 2019-nCoV-S to study cell entry of 201                Sequence analysis revealed t                We next investigated protease dependence of 2019-nCoV entry. SARS-CoV can use theendosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) for S protein priming inTMPRSS2cell lines (22). However, TMPRSS2 is expressed in viral target cells in the lung (23) and entryinto TMPRSS2+ cell lines is promoted by TMPRSS2 (15-17) and is partially CatB/Lindependent, although blockade of both proteases is required for efficient entry inhibition (24).Moreover, TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L activity is essential for spread of SARS-CoV and othercoronaviruses in the infected host (25, 26). For initial insig                Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibody response directed against theviral S protein (27). We investigated w                T                Priming of coronavirus S proteins by host cell proteases is essential for viral entry intocells and protease choice can determine zoonotic potential (31). The S proteins of SARS-CoVcan use the endosomal cysteine proteases for S protein priming in TMPRSS2- cells (22).However, S protein priming by TMPRSS2 but not CatB/L is essential for viral entry into primarytarget cells and for viral spread in the infected host (24-26). T        Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibody response that can be detectedeven 24 months after infection (27) and this is largely directed against the S protein. Moreover,experimental SARS vaccines, including recombinant S protein (32) and inactivated virus (33)induce neutralizing antibody responses. Our results, although limited in significance due to asingle patient serum being available for testing, indicate that neutralizing antibody responses6raised against SARS-S should also offer some protection against 2019-nCoV infection, whichmay have implications for outbreak control.16616716816917017117217317417517617717817918018118218318418518618718818919019119219319419519619719819920020120220320420520620720820921021121221313.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23723823924024124224324424524624724824925025125225325425525625725825926032.Y.
