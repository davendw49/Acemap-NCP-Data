As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geostratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city's lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts. One Sentence Summary: A geo-stratified debiasing approach incorporating human movement data was developed to improve modeling of the 2019-nCoV epidemic.", "text": "Originating from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, the 2019-nCoV epidemic has spread acrossChina and 23 other countries, as of February 2, 2020 (1\u20133). As part of the national effort tocontain the outbreak, an emergency lockdown measure was implemented city-wide in Wuhan onJanuary 23, 2020, one day before the Chinese New Year Eve. However, according to officialaccount, at least five million people already travelled from Wuhan to other parts of China beforethe city\u2019s lockdown, causing many 2019-nCoV cases outside of Wuhan.Estimating the key epidemiological parameters of 2019-nCoV has become a researchpriority with significant clinical and policy relevance. However, due to the limited emergingunderstanding of the new virus and its transmission mechanisms, results are largely inconsistentacross studies. For example, estimates of the basic reproductive number range from 2.2 to 3.1based on data collected in the early stage of the epidemic (1, 3\u20135). Attempts were also made toestimate the size of the epidemic, and forecast the progression of the epidemic with ratherdifferent conclusions (1, 4, 5).Lacking accurate accounting or sampling of the ground truth as for the number of latentlyinfected and undiagnosed infectious (L&I) persons is the primary cause for the widespreaddiscrepancy in these estimates and forecasts. In particular, for the 2019-nCoV, one fundamentalchallenge is the under-screening and under-reporting biases in the early stage of the epidemic inits epicenter, Wuhan, due to limited testing and treatment resources while facing a majoroutbreak with a sudden onset. Note that this challenge is not unique to 2019-nCoV; see relateddiscussions for SARS and other coronavirus outbreaks (6, 7).To tackle this major challenge, we developed a geo-stratified debiasing estimationframework based on the following observation. On the contrary to Wuhan, other places in Chinahave ample screening and treatment resources in relative terms, and started various stringentsurveillance programs after the Wuhan lockdown, to screen and monitor people who travelledfrom Wuhan to these places. As such, the chance of under-screening and underreporting is muchlower outside Wuhan, especially outside Hubei Province. Our approach stratifies mainlandChina into three zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland Chinaexcluding Hubei (Fig. 1). Incorporating data capturing the size of the population-level movementfrom Wuhan to the destinations in other zones with the official confirmed 2019-nCoV casecounts in these destinations, we obtained a reliable estimate of the latent infection ratio, definedas the proportion of L&I persons among the population, in Wuhan before the lockdown. In turn,this estimate enabled us to derive the basic reproductive number, the number of L&I persons inWuhan before and after the lockdown, and assess the progression of the epidemic nationally.Fig. 2A shows the relationship between the number of people traveling from Wuhan during theperiod of January 16, 2020 to January 22, 2020, and the number of confirmed cases in 12representative provinces and municipalities during the period of January 23, 2020 to January 29,2020. The lag between these two time intervals was introduced to accommodate thecommonlyassumed 7-day incubation period for 2019-nCoV (3). These representative provinces andmunicipalities are those that had received at least 30,000 travelers from Wuhan within athreeweek window starting on January 1, 2020 and ending on January 22, 2020, prior to thelockdown.Similarly, Fig. 2B presents the same relationship for 14 cities within Hubei Province.These cities had received at least 100,000 travelers from Wuhan. From Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B, weobserve a statistically significant positive linear relationship between the number of travelersfrom Wuhan and the cumulative case count in most provinces and cities. For two provinces,Zhejiang and Jiangsu (in Fig. 2A), and two Hubei cities, Xiaogan and Huanggang (in Fig. 2B),we observe superlinear growth in the cumulative case counts, explainable by the knownsignificant secondary local transmissions. Fig. 2C presents zone-level aggregated results.Under our proposed geo-stratified debiasing framework, the latent infection ratio amongthe people traveling from Wuhan to other destinations in mainland China excluding Hubei withina three-week window prior to the lockdown, is estimated as 0.12% (95% CI: 0.09%-0.15%).Based on this latent infection ratio, we inferred that there were in total 18,556 (95% CI:14,13422,978) L&I persons in Wuhan before the lockdown, under the assumption that this latentinfection ratio remained the same for people traveling from and remaining in Wuhan. Amongthese L&I persons, 10,887 (95% CI: 8,292-13,481) stayed in Wuhan on January 23, 2020, whenthe lockdown was initiated, and the remaining 7,669 (95% CI: 5,842-9,497) traveled to otherparts of mainland China. Among the traveling L&I persons, 4,644-7,549 went to other places inHubei Province, and 1,198 to 1,947 to places outside Hubei.We followed a similar geo-stratified debiasing process, relying on more reliable casecounts outside of Hubei to estimate the basic reproduction number R0 for 2019-nCoV. Our R0estimate is 3.24, indicating that on average one infected case is expected to generate 3.24secondary infected cases prior to isolation or death. This value is within the range of that of the2003 SARS epidemic (2-5) (8), and higher than that of influenza (2-3) (9) and Ebola (1.5-2.5)(10). Compared to the WHO\u2019s estimate (1.4-2.5) and other recently reported estimates (2.2-3.1)of 2019-nCoV (1, 3\u20135), our estimate is at the high end. This can be partially explained by thefact that most published estimates are based on all confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, including theWuhan case counts, prone to the under-screening and underreporting biases. When consideringthe possibility of a large number of infected and infectious individuals who will not developclinical disease, the actual value of R0 could be even higher.Building on the estimated latent infection ratio, R0, and the number of L&I persons inWuhan when the lockdown started, we developed a customized epidemiological model tosimulate the progression of the 2019-nCoV epidemic after the lockdown of Wuhan (seesupplementary materials for details). Given the stringent nature of the lockdown measures andthe continuing underreporting bias in Wuhan, the characteristics of the epidemic within andoutside Wuhan were treated differently.This report introduces a geo-stratified approach for estimating the latent infection ratio in Wuhanwith the presence of severe under-screening and underreporting biases. The estimated latentinfection ratio enabled us to conduct further epidemiological investigations to better understandthe ongoing 2019-nCoV epidemic.Our findings have important implications with respect to the development of 2019-nCoVcontrol and prevention policies in mainland China. First, the previous estimates of R0 are likelyto have resulted in an underestimation of the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, mainly due to theunder-reporting bias during the early phase in Wuhan. Second, the actual epidemic size inWuhan and Hubei is larger than what has so far been reported based on confirmed case data.Third, for parts of Mainland China outside Hubei the risk of further outbreaks is likely to belimited, as long as locally occurring cases of secondary and tertiary transmissions can bedetected and isolated effectively. The recent quarantine lockdown of Wenzhou was in responseto detection of large numbers of secondary transmissions.It is absolute key for being able to prevent this epidemic from becoming a pandemic thatcases of clinical disease are detected and isolated as early as possible. In addition, all high-riskcontacts need to be traced to identify secondary transmissions. The public health surveillancesystem in China is facing tremendous challenge give the population size and sensitivity of thesystem is to be enhanced. It is therefore paramount that available resources are used optimally.An understanding of the spatial distribution of the L&I persons is critical in this context, sincethey are the reservoir of clinical cases and of secondary transmission, although to a lesser extentthan clinical cases. The annual migration around the Lunar New Year compounded the situationin that it immensely increased movements across the country. The human movement datautilized in this study provides a robust data source for estimating the likely dissemination of2019-nCoV cases across the country (Fig. 3B), providing important epidemiological informationthat is much less affected by delayed- or under-reporting bias. The management of the epidemicover the coming weeks when people travel back from their hometowns to their work places willbe critical for being able to bring it under control. We recommend that the national and localauthorities process real-time human movement data through mathematical models to forecast thespatio-temporal dynamics of further 2019-nCoV outbreaks across Mainland China. This willallow developing early detection, isolation and quarantine strategies tailored to the very dynamicepidemiological situation, as well as identify potential problems in the implementation of localdisease control policies and inform the design of any necessary adjustments.Acknowledgments: The authors thank J.

A listing ofthese websites is provided by the National Health Commission of People\u2019s Republic of China athttp://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqfkdt/gzbd_index.shtml.The human movement data used in the study consists of aggregated statistics provided bythe two largest telecommunications operators in China, covering the daily counts of the numberof mobile phone users traveling from Wuhan and reaching other destinations outside of Wuhanin mainland China, between January 1, 2020 and January 22, 2020. Given the very high mobilephone user penetration rate in China and the 80% market share held by these two operators, thesestatistics are expected to be representative of the actual size of the human migration originatingfrom Wuhan. Note that some users may have returned to Wuhan before traveling outboundagain. These users were counted more than once in the human movement dataset.          Due to the sensitive nature of the telecommunications data records, data processing andaggregation was conducted in-house in the telecommunications operators\u2019 secure computingenvironment by their own staff, without any participation from the author team.

From this selected list of 12 provinces and municipalities, Zhejiang Province and JiangsuProvince were excluded from our latent infection ratio estimation because of known substantialsecondary local transmissions, given that the first objective of our study is to estimate the latentinfection ratio in Wuhan during the early stage of the epidemic. For the remaining 10 provincesand municipalities, to accommodate the commonly-assumed 7-day incubation period for2019nCoV, we calculated the ratio between the count of confirmed cases between January 23, 2020and January 29, 2020, and the number of people travelling from Wuhan during the period ofJanuary 16, 2020 and January 22, 2020. Table S1 presents these counts and the calculated ratios.Seven provinces and municipalities offered detailed information concerning secondary localtransmissions when publishing daily case counts. Table S2 presents the cumulative data for theseplaces.The estimated latent infection ratio (0.12%) as reported in the main manuscript wascalculated from the data reported in Tables S1 and S2, following the estimation model presentedbelow.          Let \" denote the number of cumulative confirmed cases in province , and \" the numberof people traveling from Wuhan to province . Mainland China has 31 provinces. Given theavailable data from the 10 selected provinces/municipalities, the latent infection ratio, theproportion of latently infected and undiagnosed infectious (L&I) persons in all people travelingfrom Wuhan, , were calculated following the standard approach for ratio estimation (          =(. 10where  denotes the slope of the fitted linear relationship of (\", \"), and  the averageproportion of non-secondary cases (see Table S2), estimated around 0.776.The resulting estimated latent infection ratio is 0.12% (95% CI: 0.09%-0.15%). Using thisratio, we in turn estimated that there were 18,556 (95% CI: 14,134-22,978) L&I persons (out of15.34 million population) in Wuhan before the city\u2019s lockdown. Among these L&I persons,7,670 traveled to other destinations in Mainland China while the rest 10,886 remained in Wuhan.          The standard SEIR model assumes four categories of persons: Susceptible, Exposed(corresponding to the latently infected cases in the main manuscript), Infectious, and Recovered.To investigate the 2019-nCoV epidemic, we adopted a the SEIRDC model (          ()()= \u2212 .
