SARS-CoV-2 is ahuman-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease andpneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had beenconfirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increasedtransmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individualswithout any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent todevelop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identifythese early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here wedeveloped an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based methodfor COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. Weassured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 relatedviruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normalcoronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detectionmethod, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reactiontime varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collectedsamples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed methodsuggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threatcontrol, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is notavailable.In December 2019, the first case of cluster unidentified pneumonia was found inWuhan, named 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a beta subtype, highlyhomologous with SARS(1). As of February 18, 2020, there were in total 75,201 confirmedcases worldwide. With the rapid spreading speed of R0 3.28, there is a heavypressure for hospital assistant diagnosis, as some infected individuals without anysymptoms could still transfer the virus to others(2). Thus, there is an urgent need to developa diagnostic method that is sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost to screen infectedindividuals, facilitate proper isolation and help controlling the disease spread.For RNA virus infections, especially acute respiratory infection, probe coupledRT-qPCR from respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses(39). This method has been widely used by Center for Disease Control andPrevention and other relevant departments worldwide. Recently RT-qPCR based methodswere developed and applied worldwide by multiple research and disease controlcenters (10). However, RT-qPCR has many limitations such as the need for high puritysamples and the access to expensive laboratory instruments, as well as requiring longreaction times (at least 2 h). In addition, RT-qPCR needs trained personnel andsophisticated facilities for sample processing. These disadvantages limit its practicalapplication in many cases, and thus can delay the required rapid prescription andadministration of antiviral agents to patients.Loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technology that providesnucleic acid amplification in a short time using 4 to 6 specially designed primers anda DNA polymerase with chain displacement activity (Bst) under a constanttemperature (60-65 )(11, 12). Particularly relevant for this application, is that LAMP can becombined with reverse transcription (i.e. RT-LAMP), were both reverse transcriptionand amplification occur simultaneously allowing the direct detection of RNA (13-17).This system, can be coupled with a pH indicator present in the reaction mix allowingreadout of the amplification reaction by change in color (18). Therefore, LAMP hasthe potential to offer an easy diagnostic test where the result could be directly observethe color change with the naked eye.The present study describes an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO(isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19), for rapid colorimetric detection ofuation.RNA extractionRespiratory samples were obtained from patients sent to the Shenyang CDC andtested by the RT-qPCR kit. RNA was further diluted for iLACO development andevalRNA was extracted from clinic samples with COVID-19 virus infection during theepidemic in Shenyang in 2020 with the Thermo nuclear acid extraction workstation inthe P3 laboratory of CDC Shenyang. Before the experiment, the concentrationof virus RNA sample was measured with Qubit 3.0 (Thermo Fisher).Reverse TranscriptionCOVID-19 virus RNA was reverse transcribed using random primer withSuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA).The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 50\u00b0C for 1 h. The cDNAobtained was used as the detection sample of RT-LAMP reaction as well.Real-time reverse-transcription PCRTwo kits were used in parallel to validate the positive samples (BGI and Biotech &Biomedicine Science \uff08Shenyang\uff09). Briefly, a 20 \u00b5l reaction volume containing 5\u03bclRNA template, 13 \u03bcl master mix, 2 \u03bcl primer and probe mix. The reversetranscription reaction was performed at 50\u00b0 for 5 minutes, the initial denaturation was 94\u00b0 for2 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0 for 5s and annealing at 55\u00b0 for 10s. ThePCR apparatus used in this research were CFX96 TouchTM Real-Time PCRDetection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system.iLACO developmentTo develop the iLACO, we first use the commercialized WarmStart master mix kitfrom NEB combined with 10 panel of designed primers. A 20 \u00b5l reaction contained10\u00b5l WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2XRNA/cDNA sample as positive reaction and 7\u00b5l DEPC-treated water. For thenegative control group, we replaced the template RNA/cDNA with DEPC-treated water.Mixed reactions were all performed in PCR thermo-cycler or water bath incubation at65 \u00b0C for 20-40 minutes. Positive reactions resulted in a color change of phenol redpH indicator from pink to yellow due to decreased pH in the presence of extensiveDNA polymerase activity. However, the negative reaction still kept pink. Later weprepared all the solutions with individual components to optimize the reactionsolution, also with different dyes for color judgement sensitivity test.Ethical statementing individuals.Sample collection and analysis of samples were approved by the local CDC. Theinternal use of samples was agreed under the medial and ethical rules of eachparticipatRT-LAMP primers were designed by the online software Primer Explorer V5(http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html). For the primer sets, we used the onlinetool Primer-BLAST(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primerblast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome) (19) to detect whether the primer sequenceis specific to the human genome and retain the primers that all 3 pairs primers arespecific. Then compare the primer region sequence with other viruses' genome by theonline tool BLASTarch&LINK_LOC=blasthome)(20) to calculate the homology.The final set of primers used in this research for iLACO are shown in Table 1. Theconcentration of each primer in primer mix were as followed: 0.2 \u00b5M of each outerprimer (F3 and B3), 1.6 \u00b5M of each inner primer (FIP and BIP), 0.4 \u00b5M of each loopprimer(LF and LB)(21).We selected a region of the ORF1ab as target region that is currently used forRTqPCR detection approaches (Fig. 1A), and used the online software Primer ExplorerV5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) to design the RT-LAMP primers.After the specificity analysis, we retained one primer set with several pairs of loopprimers (Table 1, see Materilas and Methods for details); their genomic locations onthe virus genome can be found in Fig.1B (see also Table 1). To assure the primerspecificity, we compared their sequences with other viruses genome (include 7 similarcoronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses, and 2 other coronaviruses)(22) by BLAST andfound that the sequences were not similar to most viruses\u2019 sequences we have chosen(Fig. 1C).We used one SARS-CoV-2 positive patient respiratory RNA sample validated byRTqPCR to set up the iLACO assay. We confirmed that after 20 minutes of incubation ina thermoblock, using the designed RT-LAMP primers the targeted gene wassuccessfully amplified and a color change was observed in the reaction tubes. Specifically, achange in color from pink to light yellow indicated a positive reaction while negativereactions retained a pink color.To optimize of RT-LAMP reaction, we used five group of primers with variableLB oligos 1-5 (Table 1). We evaluated their ability to produce an effectiveamplification of both RNA and cDNA samples with 15 minutes or 20 minutes of incubationtime\uff08Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). After the incubation, in addition to the colorimetricchange, a ladder of DNA with increasing size was observed with on an agarose gelconfirming the expected DNA amplification (Fig. 2C). The 5 sets of primers werefurther tested for efficiency and the primer group 4 (containing LB4) was chosen forfurther optimization, which showed the best sensitivity (data not shown). We alsooptimized the reaction temperature to 65\u00b0 degree, as we did not observe any positivesignal using the recommended 72\u00b0 degree incubation previously used for ZIKAvirus detection by LAMP assay(21). iLACO showed similar performance when wecompared the samples from SARS-CoV-2 RNA or cDNA, indicating the one-stepisothermal amplification is sufficient and separated step for reverse transcription isnot necessary.In order to optimize the potential usage for field-based or bed-based detections,we checked the efficiency of iLACO in 1.5 ml tubes incubated with water bath orincubator. Twenty minutes of reaction is sufficient to detect the signal (Fig. 2D). Wenotice the signal is stronger compared with incubation using a thermocyclercommonly used for PCR . The longer incubation time caused the water drops on the top lid ofthe tube. To avoid this, we added few drops of mineral oil after adding all the requiredsolutions. This set up can be further optimised by using micro Pasteur Pipettescoupled with thermo cups for processing.To check the detection limit of iLACO, we prepared multiple reactions containingserial dilutions of synthesized ORF1ab gene (from 1,000,000 to 10 copies). As shownin Figure 3, iLACO is very sensitive, and as low as 10 copies of ORF1ab gene weredetected successfully (1:100000 dilution in Fig. 3A). Further, we compared iLACOwith RT-qPCR assay with the diluted RNA sample from patient number 200202(10times dilution, SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration around 17 copies/ \u00b5l).. We observedthe iLACO reaction time correlating well with RT-qPCR cycles. ie. 37 minutes colorturning point correlated with 37 cycles (Fig. 3B and C). However, the 20 \u00b5l volumereaction time in 1.5 ml tubes incubated on wather bath are much fastercompared toRT-qPCR or samples processedin 0.2 ml tubes in PCR thermocycler, partially due tothe increased heating volume and even surrounding temperature.Detection of amplified product by alternative methodsTo further expand the iLACO detection capability, we also checked the UV or Bluelight stimulated fluorescence signal. We added SYBR green dye into the reaction mixprior to adding the sample. After 20 minutes incubation in 65 degree, the signal wasobserved with Gel imaging system (Fig. 4A). SYBR green in positive reactions wasobserved clearly in positive reaction. We also chose a new type of nucleic acid dyeGeneFinderTM, which has enhanced fluorescent signal and sensitivity. By exposingunder Blue light, green fluorescence was observed clearly with naked eye in thepositive reaction, whereas it remained original pink in the negative control (Fig. 4B).Finally, we evaluated the iLACO with total 43 samples initially diagnosed withRTqPCR during the epidemic in Shenyang in 2020. Results showed that 97.6% (42/43)of samples validated by qPT-PCR showed consistent signal after 40 min incubationwith 2 \u00b5l sample loading(RNA concentration range 0.2-47 ng/\u00b5l). One sample keptunchanged color after 50 minutes, indicating the low dose of virus would cause falsenegative or spontaneous negative signal. To confirm this, we repeated this samplemultiple times with random positive signal, confirming that this samples was close tothe detection threshold using 2\u00b5l. Currently most the RT-qPCR reactions in China forSARS-CoV-2 test use 5 \u00b5l sample input. We thereby checked whether increasing theused sample volume would facilitate the detection. However, increasing the volumeof the loaded sample to 5 \u00b5l RNA sample lead to variable results. This is most likelydue to the presence of Tris or EDTA in the RNA dilution buffer when automatic RNAextraction workstation is used. This could be optimized by adjusting the concentrationof used buffers. We recommend to use always a positive and a negative controlsample resuspended in the same buffers used for patient RNA isolation.DiscussionThe most popular methods for RNA virus detection so far are based on RT-PCRand/or RT-qPCR; while these methods only take a run time of 2-3 hours, they requirespecial experimental apparatus, controlled working environment and well-trainedpersonnel, which are often lacking in massive virus outbreaks such as the SARS orCOVID-19. In this research, we developed an optimized iLACO that can rapid andsensitively detect COVID-19 virus RNA or cDNA samples based on LAMPisothermal amplification. The reaction time takes 20-30 minutes at 65\u00b0C. The result showedthat by optimizing the concentration of primers, the total reaction time would beshorter for high dose virus carriers. iLACO detection method could not only detectthe RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also worked on the cDNA samples.The use of iLACO will facilitate the widely application of virus detection test,especially in developing countries with limited facilities, and when compared withother assays that are laborious, costly, and time-consuming(23).Currently, there is a lack of specific drugs for the treatment of the novelcoronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, so the early detection and following treatment isessential to control the spread of the disease. Therefore the detection of COVID-19 is ofvital importance. The first version of iLACO with six primers could specificallyidentify eight distinct regions of the ORF1ab target. Our blast analysis suggest that thehighly specific primer set design have a low chance for unspecific amplifications(false positives).This work was funded by 2020 LiaoNing Provence Key Research Project(1580441949000), Ganzhou COVID-19 Emergency Research Project.VP is funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR 2016-01842), a WallenbergAcademy Fellowship (KAW 2016.0123), the Swedish Foundations\u2019 Starting Grant(Ragnar S\u00f6derberg Foundation), Karolinska Institutet (SciLifeLab Fellowship, SFOand KI funds) and a Joint China-Sweden mobility grant from STINT(CH20187750).
