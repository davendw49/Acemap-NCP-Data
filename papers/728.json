Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils,eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. Therewere three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantlyhigher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay.pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, a mega city with an 11 million population in centralidentified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARSof whom 3,045 died and 5,737 were admitted into ICU [2]. In response to this fast-spreadingepidemic, the Chinese government has locked down the epicenter Wuhan city since 23January 2020, and implemented a series of social distancing measures such as strict trafficrestrictions, forbidden social gatherings, closure of residential communities[3]. Theepidemiological data showed that most cases had mild symptoms, and overall case fatalityrate was 2.3%. Although the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 seems considerably lower than twoprevious zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it was far more efficient totransmit between close contacts.[4] Particularly, this novel coronavirus has caused specialconcerns in pregnant women, because both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been found tocause severe complications in pregnant women[5]. Several reports on suspicious verticaltransmission of this virus have further increased such concerns[6]. Although the recentlaboratory studies and clinical reports did not find strong evidence to support a verticaltransmission route, the possibility still cannot be completely ruled out [7-9].14]. However, the clinical reports on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant womenwith SARS-CoV-2 infection remain sparse. An earlier study by Chen et al reported ninepregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, who took cesarean section in a tertiary hospitalof Wuhan [7]. These patients showed clinical symptoms similar to non-pregnant patients withtransmission. To date, none of previous studies have compared maternal and neonataloutcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia to those without pneumonia, toinvestigate the adverse effects of COVID-19 infection on pregnancy.hospital beds, during January 24 \u2013 February 29, 2020. We followed the clinical diagnosiscriteria for COVID-19 pneumonia in the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention andswabs were collected from all these patients and sent to the laboratory of the Wuhan Centerfor Disease Control and Prevention for tests of SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis criteria ofCOVID19 infection include 1) typical chest CT imaging of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity,and 2) positive in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests forSARSCOVID-19 infection cases due to low virus titers, sampling at late stage of illness, andinappropriate swabbing sites[7]. Given overloaded healthcare systems and limited testcapacities during our study period, we were concerned about underreporting of COVID-19cases if solely relying on laboratory tests. Therefore, in this study we also included thesuspected patients with typical chest CT imaging but negative in RT-PCR tests. Elevenpregnant women who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were classified as laboratoryconfirmed case group, and eighteen with typical chest CT imaging but tested negative inRTThe control group of pregnant women without pneumonia during hospital stay wererandomly selected from the medical records by an investigator (MP), who was not involvedin statistical analysis. Only those aged 25-35 years were selected to match the age range ofcases. We selected 121 women who were admitted during the same period (control 2020group). Considering the potential adverse effects of mental stress caused by city lockdownand severe epidemics, we also included a second control group of 121 women admittedduring January 24 \u2013 February 11, 2019 (control 2019 group). Blood test results were alsoretrieved from medical records. Two case groups underwent a blood test every three days buttwo control groups only took once on admission.collected from medical records and reviewed independently by two investigators (YXL andClinical characteristics and maternal outcomesmaternal complications, significantly higher than the controls (31-33%).

Twopatients had vaginal delivery because neither presented any respiratory symptoms whenadmitted for full-term labor. One of them had fever two days after childbirth and another hadIn addition to pneumonia, eleven out of 16 confirmed cases had gestational complications onadmission, including gestational diabetes mellitus (n=3), premature rupture of membranes(1), gestational hypertension (3), hypothyroidism (2), preeclampsia (1) and sinus tachycardia(1). None of confirmed COVID-19 patients reported an exposure history. Four were admittedwith fever for investigation and eight developed fever after childbirth (Table 2). Nonepresented other respiratory symptoms on admission nor during hospital stay. Two ofsuspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients reported cough, sore throat, dyspnea, diarrhea andvomiting.Laboratory investigations and treatmentAll patients took chest CT scans. Ten of confirmed cases had typical image of pneumonia inboth lungs and seven in single lung. Fifteen out of eighteen suspected patients had both lungsaffected. Compared to the controls, two case groups had slightly lower counts of white bloodcells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) onadmission, although none reached statistical significance and most were marginally beyondthe normal range (Table 3). Lymphocytes, eosinophils and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)were comparable between the cases and controls. An increase of WBC, neutrophils, and CRPwere observed in the first postpartum blood test of confirmed cases, followed by a decreasein the second postpartum test (Figure 1). But this transient change was not found in suspectedcases. Lymphocytes remained at the lower end of normal range in two case groups.during hospital stay. All of them have been discharged or transferred to the designatedhospitals for COVID-19 patients, and length of stay in our hospital ranged from 3 to 26 days,with a median of 9 days. None were admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) because ofNeonatal outcomessingleton and two twins). Two singletons were born prematurely due to premature rupture ofmembranes and placental abruption. There were 23.5% and 21.1% preterm births among thenewborns of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, significantlyhigher than those of the controls (5.8% and 5.0% in the 2020 and 2019 controls) (Table 4).two control groups (2.5%). Newborns showed no significant differences between the casesand controls in key neonatal indicators including gestational age at birth, APGAR score at 5minutes, and intrauterine fetal distress. No events of severe neonatal asphyxia and deathsoccurred in these newborns.maternal and neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia with the patients withnoncaused generally mild respiratory symptoms in pregnant women. Clinical signs andsymptoms mainly included fever and pneumonia, but other respiratory symptoms were lesscommon. Our results echo the findings of a previous study in pregnant women with SARS innote that most patients did not have any symptoms on admission. For the purpose ofscreening for suspected cases, we asked all pre-laboring pregnant women to take low-dosechest CT scans with the abdominal region covered, and found that 2.1% fulfilled the criteriaof COVID-19 pneumonia (patchy shadows and ground glass opacity in single or both lungs).well as strengthening infection control measures in obstetric wards during the epidemics.respiratory symptoms. None of our patients developed severe respiratory complications torequire critical care. Laboratory investigations on admission found lower counts of WBC,neutrophils, CRP, and ALT in pregnant women, compared to the non-pneumonia controls.who often had lymphopenia and decreased WBC [10]. Slightly increased WBC, neutrophils,eosinophils and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests. We also notice that confirmedand suspected cases shared similar dynamic profiles, suggesting that laboratory test resultsmight not be very useful in making differential diagnosis.cesarean section patients, we also reported two pregnant woman who had a full-term vaginaldelivery and was confirmed with COVID-19 pneumonia on the day of delivery. We observeda higher incidence rate of premature delivery in confirmed cases (33.3%), but none was dueto severe maternal respiratory failure. This rate was higher than in suspected patients (21.1%)and then two control groups (~5%) in our study, but slightly lower than the rate of 44% inconfirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients reported by Chen et al.[7] We did not observe anydeaths or events of severe complications associated with COVID-19 pneumonia that requiredcritical care in the pregnant women and newborns. Hence, the adverse effects of COVID-19pneumonia on pregnancy appear less severe than those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.preterm delivery was as high as 80% [17]. Although no maternal deaths were recorded in theeventually died[18]. A previous study also reported that SARS-CoV infection could increasethe risk of preterm delivery in second trimester and spontaneous abortion in firsttrimester[16]. Since all of our patients were in the third trimester, the potential adverse effectof SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first and second trimesters remains to be investigated.COVID-19 infection has been included as one indication for cesarean section in our hospital,because there was only one negative pressure operation room suitable for airborneprecautions. Two patients had vaginal delivery in labor rooms of positive pressure beforethey were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. No transmission events occurred in thedoctors and midwives, who were wearing a full set of personal protective equipment (N95respirators, protective gown, gloves and goggles) during the delivery procedure. Healthcareworkers need to stay vigilant against COVID-19 infection when there is an epidemic inneighborhood or pregnant women have a travel history to an epidemic area within 14 days.infection [7, 20], we did not find any evidence to support the vertical transmission ofSARSCoV-2 from mother to fetus via placenta or during cesarean section. Our study also addedsome evidence to suggest that the risk of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery mightalso be trivial. There were two patients with vaginal delivery, one was two days before theonset of symptoms and another was during the course of illness. Neither of their newbornshad respiratory systems after birth. Unfortunately, none of them gave us the consent to collectthe respiratory specimens of their neonates. Given the small sample size of our study, thepossibility of vertical transmission during vaginal delivery still cannot be ruled out.There are a few caveats in our study. First, this is a retrospective case control study from onesingle center, which could be subject to recall bias and selection bias. Second, we collectedthe data of sixteen pregnant women with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia andeighteen suspected cases with typical CT imaging. Although this is the largest number ofpregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in literature so far, the sample size is stillrelatively small. Nevertheless, given the potential of this virus to cause a global pandemic, webelieve our study could be one of important clinical studies to guide the clinical diagnosis andtreatment to this vulnerable group.delivery or caesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms on admission.pneumonia, except a transient increase of WBC, neutrophils and CRP was found inpostpartum blood tests. Given the time delay in PCR tests, chest CT scans in the thirdtrimester might be an effective way of screening for COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnantwomen, particularly in areas with ongoing epidemics.www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: no support from any organisation for thesubmitted work; no financial relationships with any organisations that might have an interestin the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities thatcould appear to have influenced the submitted work.Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.
