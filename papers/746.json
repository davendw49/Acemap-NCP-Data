The basicreproduction number, R0, represents such a measurement indicating the average number of secondarycases that primary cases generate in a completely susceptible population in the absence of interventions orbehavioral changes. R0>1 indicated the possibility of sustained transmission, whereas R0<1 implies thattransmission chains cannot sustain epidemic growth. As the epidemic continues its course, the effectivereproduction number offers a time-dependent record of the average number of secondary cases per case asthe number of susceptible individuals gets depleted and control interventions takes effect. Herein weemployed two different methods to quantify the reproduction number using the curve of reportedCOVID19 cases.        Using a Wikipedia entry as a starting point, Farsi-speaking coauthor SFR double-checked the dataof daily reported new cases, from February 19 through 29, 2020, using Iranian official press releases andother credible news sources, and corrected the data as per the official data. Two methods were utilized toestimate the reproduction number. The first method utilized a generalized growth model (GGM) (                The second method for estimating the reproduction number is based on the calculation of theepidemic\u2019s doubling times, which correspond to the times when the cumulative incidence doubles. We535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576estimated the epidemic doubling time using the curve of cumulative daily reported cases. To quantifyparameter uncertainty, we used parametric bootstrapping with a Poisson error structure around thenumber of new reported cases in order to derive 95% confidence intervals of our estimates. Assumingexponential growth, the epidemic growth rate is equal to ln(                In both methods, the serial interval was assumed to follow a gamma distribution (mean: 4.41days; standard deviation: 3.17 days) (        Using Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.6 (95% CI, 3.2, 4.2) for theCOVID19 epidemic in Iran. We estimated a growth rate of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.69, 1) and a scaling parameter of 0.89(95% CI: 0.84, 0.95). The latter indicated a near-exponential growth of the epidemic (Figure). UsingMethod 2, we found that from February 19 through February 29, the cumulative incidence of confirmedcases in Iran had doubled 8 times. The estimated epidemic doubling time is 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05, 1.44)days and the corresponding R0 estimate is 3.58 (95% CI, 1.29, 8.46).        Our study has limitations. First, it is based on the number of daily reported cases whereas itwould be ideal to analyze case counts by date of symptom onset that are unavailable. Second, case countscould be underreported due to underdiagnosis, given subclinical or asymptomatic cases. The rapidincrease in case count might represent a belated realization of the severity of the epidemic and a rapidprocess of catching up with testing many suspected cases. If the reporting ratio remains constant over thestudy period, and given the near-exponential growth of the epidemic\u2019s trajectory, our estimates wouldremain reliable; however, this is a strong assumption. Third, while data are not stratified according toimported and local cases, we assumed that they were infected locally, as it is likely that transmission hasbeen ongoing in Iran for some time (        In conclusion, we used two different methods to compute the basic reproduction number ofCOVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Our mean estimate is at 3.6, which means that on average 3.6 susceptibleindividuals would be infected by one infectious individual. An epidemic trajectory of near-exponentialgrowth raises serious concern. Our estimates provide further evidence that the epidemic situation in Iranis dire.

Forthis purpose, we first characterize the daily reported incidence using the generalized growth model (GGM)(                        Next, to estimate the most recent estimate of Rt, we simulate the progression of incident reported cases fromthe calibrated GGM, and apply the discretized probability distribution (  ) of the serial interval using therenewal equation (            \u2211=0 ( \u2212 ) .In the renewal equation we denote the total incidence at calendar time by  . Here, the denominatorrepresents the total number of cases that contribute to the incidence cases at time   . Next, we estimate            from 300 simulated curves assuming a Poisson error structure to derive the uncertainty bounds aroundour estimate of the reproduction number (            Estimate of reproduction number from epidemic doubling times (Method 2)We ran simulation to generate 10,000 sets of estimates of epidemic doubling times for a given time seriesof cumulative number of reported cases, and to compute the arithmetic mean of each set. Then, the harmonicmean of these estimates was calculated across 10,000 sets of simulations and was reported as our estimatedepidemic doubling time, with 95% confidence interval (Table S2).            Next, we drew 10,000 random values for the serial interval from a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.414041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162days and a standard deviation of 3.17 days (            Reproduction number = 1 + growth rate \u00d7 serial intervalWe reported the mean and 95% of the 10,000 estimated values of the reproduction number (Table S2).Results for Region 1 and Region 3 of IranIn addition to estimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 across Iran, we further analyzed the datafor Region 1 and Region 3 of Iran, which happened to have higher numbers of cumulative number of casesthan other regions by February 29, 2020. Region 1 of Iran include Qom Province (QOM), Tehran Province(TEH), Mazandaran Province (MAZ), Alborz Province (ALB), Semnan Province (SEM), GolestanProvince (GOL), and Qazvin Province (QAZ). Region 3 of Iran include Gilan Province (GIL), ArdabilProvince (ARD), East Azerbajian Province (AZS), West Azerbajian Province (AZG), Kurdistan (orFor Region 1, using Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.6 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.4) with a growthrate of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.89) and a scaling parameter of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Using Method 2,the estimated epidemic doubling time was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.10, 1.61) and the estimated reproduction numberwas 3.40 (95% CI, 1.27, 7.91) (Table S2, Figures S1, S2 and S3).For Region 3, using Method 1, we estimated a reproduction number of 3.0 (95% CI, 2.2, 4.2) with a growthrate of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.54, 1.6) and a scaling parameter of 0.80 (95% CI 0.63, 0.98). Using Method 2, theestimated epidemic doubling time was 1.30 (95% CI, 1.04, 1.78) and the estimated reproduction numberwas 3.38 (95% CI, 1.26, 8.04) (Table S2, Figures S1, S2 and S3).It appeared that whether it was for Iran as a whole, or for its Region 1 or Region 3, the point estimate of the636465estimated reproduction number was 3.0 or higher. However, the estimates obtained from Method 1 had asmaller variance. The estimates obtained from Method 2 had a larger variance, given the large variance ofthe serial interval estimate that we used.67Region 1: Qom Province (QOM), Tehran Province (TEH), Mazandaran Province (MAZ), Alborz Province (ALB), Semnan Province (SEM),Region 3: Gilan Province (GIL), Ardabil Province (ARD), East Azerbajian Province (AZS), West Azerbajian Province (AZG), Kurdistan (or            Table S2.
