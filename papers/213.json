One of the common questions in an epidemic is its final size and its peak time. For answering this question various models are used: analytical [1-4], stochastic [5], phenomenological [6, 7] In this note, we will try to estimate a final epidemic size and its peak by the phenomenological model, i.e., with the logistic growth regression model [7, 8]. The estimation is made in two steps: first, data are sequentially fitted by logistic model and second, the estimated finale sizes are fitted by the Weibull function.", "text": "number of cases then the solution of (1) is(1)1 dCC dt\uf0e6\uf0e7\uf03d r \uf0e71 \uf02d\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8C \uf0f6\uf0f7\uf0f7 ,\uf0f7K \uf0f8\uf0f7where A \uf03d0 The growth ratereaches its maximum when\uf03d 0 .

The discrepancy between data set fora period of 22 Jan to 26 Jan is between 1% to 6%.For practical calculation, we use MATLAB\u2019s functions lsqcurvefit and fitnlm(see Apendix).Based on available data (til 16 Feb 2020), the predicted final size of epidemy is about100000 cases (see Table 1, see Fig 1, 2) and its peak was on 11 Feb 2020. With the newdata, these estimates will change reliably within days.PredictedActual10090807060)00 5001(tced 40eIfn302010001/02/2001/03/20Date0.20.180.160.140.120.040.0200.1 it/yadapa0.08 rcep/detc0.06 fenI01/02/2001/03/202020)and the epidemy would reach its peak on 4 Feb 2020. However, a new way of datacollection distorts this prediction. By using the Weibull model we obtain the final sizeof the epidemy of about 1.2 million infections (see Table 4). We stress that thisprediction should be taken with care because there is not yet enough data to use theWeibull model for the final prediction of epidemy size. This also applies to the finalprediction of the epidemy peak time (Fig 5) where Weibull regression predicts paektime at day 218, i.e.at 22 Aug 2020.)000 601t(deceIfn 4020002/02/2009/02/2016/02/20Date16.02.2020 13:2116.Feb. 2020 (see Fig 3)y 15aD105002/02/2009/02/2016/02/20regression data (red line) (Table 5).16.02.2020 13:21data till 16.Feb. 2020 (see Fig 5)On the base of available data, one can not yet predict the final size of coronavirusepidemy using the logistic model. If however, in the next three or four days the numberof cases will be about say 72000 then we can predict that the final number of cases willbe about 100 000, and that peak will be at about 32 days, i.e., at 18.
