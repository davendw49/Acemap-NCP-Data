We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected.

Only China so far registered a widespread epidemic2, and authorities haveimplemented massive intervention measures to curtail it3. Outside China, affected countries are facingimportations of cases and clusters of local transmission1,4,5 Border controls have been reinforced inmany countries, and active surveillance has been intensified to rapidly detect and isolate importations,trace contacts and isolate suspect cases6,7.The effectiveness of such measures, however, critically depends on COVID-19 epidemiology andnatural history8,9, as well as the volume of importations6. The presence of an incubation period, duringwhich infected individuals carry on their usual activities (including travel), is a major challenge forscreening controls at airports8. Moreover, mild non-specific symptoms and transmission before theonset of clinical symptoms2,10 may compromise infection control measures for importations andonward transmissions9. There is concern that imported cases may have gone undetected andcontribute unknowingly to the global spread of the disease11\u201315.Here we systematically collected and analyzed data on 288 COVID-19 confirmed cases outside China.We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission,characterizing their case timeline. We developed a statistical model to nowcast trends in importationsand quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases.We collected all international cases confirmed by official public health sources in the period fromJanuary 3 to February 13, 2020. Case history was reconstructed by searching the scientific literature,official public health sources, and news. Case history included: dates of travel and symptoms onset,date of COVID-19 confirmation, date of hospital admission, date of case isolation, travel history,epidemiological link with other cases, hospitalization history. International cases included importedcases, secondary cases out of China, and repatriations. Cases from cruises were not considered here.Information was extracted by LDD and EO and checked by MM. The full database, along with thedatabase describing clusters, were made publicly available16.For imported cases with full information on the timeline of events, we computed the average durationfrom travel to onset, from travel to hospitalization, and from hospitalization to reporting. We usedanalysis of variance to compare groups of imported cases that generated or did not generate localtransmissions. We extended the analysis to all imported cases combining cases with full and partialinformation on the timeline. We used the analysis of variance and multiple imputation for the missingdata. Results were combined using Rubin\u2019s approach17.We modeled the total number of imported cases out of China over time accounting for date of travel,delay in reporting, and source areas.We distinguished between three different sources: Hubei province (H), the rest of China (C), othercountries (O). We modeled imported cases over time as a piecewise exponential function dependingon the source and on travel restrictions in place. We assumed a different situation in Hubei provinceand the rest of the world due to the level of awareness in the different phases of the outbreak. Theexponential functions are defined as follows:'() \u2217 (,-./ $  \u2264 \"\",$ = & \"'45$ \u2217 (,-678$  > \"\"=,$ = = \u2217 (> $,where '() is the growth rate of cases coming from Hubei, and A'() , ='() , with '() = = , the@ Agrowth rates of cases coming from the rest of China and other countries, respectively. Travelrestrictions were modelled by assuming a discontinuity in the growth rate. For Hubei, we assumed thegrowth rate to change from @'() to @'45$ after the travel ban of January 23, 2020 (indicated with @);for the rest of China, we assumed an analogous change from A'() to A'45$ after January 29, 2020(A), date of first flight cancellations18. No change was considered for the other countries (= constantover time), as no restrictions of travel were established towards these countries. The scale parametersof the exponential functions (@'() , @'45$, A'() , A'45$, =) were assumed to be different among the threesources, to account for different traveling volumes and dates of beginning of importations.We modelled the time  from importation to detection of a case with a gamma distribution, $(),conditioned to the date of case importation, . $() was assumed to have constant coefficient ofvariation (SD/mean) achieved by a constant shape parameter and a rate parameter varying smoothlyin time to capture change in surveillance efficiency.We used a Bayesian framework to fit the model to imported cases by origin, travel date, andconfirmation date. Cases with partial information (e.g. missing date and/or origin of travel) wereincluded by defining latent variables marginalized out during inference. The model was then used tonowcast imported cases two weeks in the future. All details of the analysis are reported in theWe analyzed clusters of transmission generated by imported cases (index case(s) in each cluster) toestimate undetected importations. A cluster can be seeded by more than one index case when localtransmissions are epidemiologically linked to more cases traveling together (e.g. infected familymembers traveling together). We modelled the number of such 'cluster seeds', i.e. groups of indexcases, with a multinomial distribution depending on the portion of cluster seeds of size 1 or greaterthan 1 (for simplicity, this was taken as 2), on the probability of detection of a seed, and onoccurrence of secondary transmission. The likelihood function was a function of: the number G ofobserved clusters with one index case; the number H of observed clusters with more than 1 indexcases; the number J of detected index cases not leading to onward transmission; the number  ofclusters whose index cases have not been identified; and the number  of undetected imported casesthat did not generate any cluster.  can be estimated through likelihood maximization from therecords of G, H, J, .We collected 288 cases, including 163 imported cases, 109 local transmissions, 30 repatriations, and 1case of unknown origin. Fifteen cases were classified as both imported and local transmissions, sincethey contracted the infection outside China and traveled to a different country once infected (ES01,ES02, GB03, GB04, GB05, GB06, GB07, GB08, KR12, KR16, KR17, KR19, MY09, TH20, TH21 in ourdatabase16).Figure 1 summarizes the timeline of imported cases. Symptoms onset occurred after the travel to thedestination country for almost all cases for which date of travel and of onset are available (68 out of73, 93%). Complete information was available for 51 (31%) imported cases, with quality ofinformation decreasing over time (Figure S1 of the Appendix).Among imported cases with full information, the delay from travel to hospitalization was longer incases that generated secondary transmissions (mean of 10 \u00b1 0.97 days compared to 5.5 \u00b1 0.67 days,p=0.003). Overall, the duration from travel to first event (whether symptom onset, or hospitalizationfor asymptomatic) was also longer, although the difference was not statistically significant (5.0 \u00b1 0.9days vs. 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.08). Durations of hospitalization were instead comparable among thetwo groups of cases (1.5 \u00b1 0.7 days vs. 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 days for cases that generated or did not generatesecondary transmissions, respectively). Including imported cases with missing information throughimputation, we found the same trend though smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant(delay from travel to hospitalization 9.8 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 8.3 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.3; delay from travel to onset 5.8\u00b11.1 vs. 4.2 \u00b10.5 p= 0.16, for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions,respectively). This suggests that importations with missing information may be closer in characteristicsto index cases leading to onward transmission.The statistical model predicted a decrease in the average time from travel to detection from 14.5 \u00b15.5 days on January 5, 2020 to 6 \u00b1 3.5 days on February 1, 2020 (Figure 2).The model predicted a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, with a growth rate'() = 0.26 [95% CI 0.21, 0.31], corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days. In comparison, the@exponential growth from other territories (rest of China and countries other than China) was slow,'() = = = 0.04 [0.00, 0.08]. After the implementation of travel restrictions, a negative growth rateAwas estimated, signaling a decline in imported cases. The decline was sharp for Hubei (@'45$ = -0.64[-0.85, -0.48]) and more gradual for the rest of China ('45$ = -0.19 [-0.54, 0.00]).AThe predicted trend of all imported cases over time is shown in Figure 3, compared with the observeddata. Reported importations are predicted to remain stationary in the second and third week ofFebruary and to rise again due to the effect of transmission clusters outside China. Imported casesafter February 13, 2020 are in agreement with model predictions (Fig.3).Forty-two transmission clusters were identified out of China in the timeframe under study. Table 1summarizes the size and country of each cluster. Clusters were grouped according to whether theindex case: (i) was a traveling case identified prior to cluster detection; (ii) a traveling case notidentified or identified retrospectively once the cluster was observed; (iii) completely unknown.Assuming that clusters of unknown origin were linked to one of the already observed imported casesor, in other words, not linked to an undetected imported case - led to an estimate of 76 [49, 118]undetected imported cases. In this scenario, detected cases would amount to 65% of all importedcases. Assuming instead that all clusters of unknown origin were due to undetected imported casesincreased the number of undetected cases to 225 [186, 369], i.e. detected cases would correspond toonly 36% of the total.\u00a7Cluster associated to two traveling cases*The index case was identified independently from secondary transmissions**The index case was either:- identified retrospectively following case investigation prompted by the detection of secondary cases- The identity was not identified; however, the cluster was linked to a specific location/circumstance visited by Chinese travellers(shop, conference, bus tour)***No connection with other case or source of infection has been identified yet****Insufficient informationAs the COVID-19 epidemic in China shows effects of mitigation2, increasingly larger clusters ofinfections reported outside China are raising concern that other territories may start sustaining theoutbreak4,5. To contain it globally, identification, rapid management of cases, and contact tracing arekey. The success of these response measures depends critically on the volume of importations19 andthe sensitivity of active surveillance13,15.We reviewed here all confirmed cases out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020 and gathereddetailed information on case history and epidemiological links. We identified salient epidemiologicalfeatures, and modeled the number of importations over time. International exportations from Hubeigrew rapidly, fueled by the local epidemic, up to the closure of Wuhan airport preventing furthertravel of cases. Exportations from other Chinese provinces and other countries grew at a considerablyslower pace. This is related to the difference in the increase of cases between Hubei province, originof the outbreak, and the rest of the affected areas1. Such difference is likely an outcome of theimplementation of containment measures in China3,20,21, and of the increased awareness at differentphases of the outbreak22\u201326 (i.e. before and after containment measures) leading to self-isolation andquarantine.The reduced volume of exported cases worldwide following the travel ban may have given countriesthe time to prepare and strengthen their surveillance systems, as signaled by a reduction of theinterval from travel date to detection over time.Our model predicts that exportations will likely rise from areas outside China. The number of localtransmissions is rapidly increasing in the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Singapore27, and fewimportations in Asia and Europe were registered already from travelers from Japan and Singapore. Forthis reason, certain countries have updated the history of travel for the case definition of a suspectimported case to include additional countries in South Asia besides China28 or banned travelers fromEast Asian countries29. ECDC and WHO currently base their case definition on travel from Chinaonly30,31, but this may rapidly change in the next days.Before the likely rebound of exportations, identification and isolation of possible clusters outside Chinaremain essential to contain local transmission. The increasing reporting of clusters outside China withno known epidemiological link1,14 raises important concerns on the possibility to contain COVID-19epidemic worldwide. Our estimates indicate an ability of 36% to detect imported cases in countriesoutside China. This means that approximately 6 imported cases out of 10 have gone undetected.Previous estimates range from 27%13 to 38%13,15 detection rates, with variations across countries13,15.Ascertainment was estimated to be even lower (approximately 10%) when assessed onrepatriations31. Here, we excluded from this analysis all repatriation events and cruises withoutbreaks, as conditions for detection and identification may be different.Underdetection may be due to several different factors including asymptomatic infections, infectionswith mild clinical symptoms, health-seeking behavior and declaration of travel history, case definition,and underdiagnosis. Underdetection of imported cases is likely to be higher than what we estimatehere, as our analysis is conditional to the identification of clusters of cases. The current situation inItaly, with different clusters emerging in the timeframe of few hours in different areas in the North ofthe country14, shows that clusters have gone undetected and epidemiological links with the index caseare still missing. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of severalundetected clusters of chains of local transmissions. Surveillance efforts to track all suspect cases maybecome impractical if the number of cases increases too rapidly32. If that situation occurs, countriesshould be ready to step-up their response and take preparatory steps for community interventions.This study is partially funded by: the ANR project DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03); the EU grantMOOD (H2020-874850); the Municipality of Paris through the programme Emergence(s).

To account for changes in detection efficiency, we modelled  as a (discretized) gammadistribution with parameters changing with time. More precisely, the rate parameter of the distributionwas X =  \u2217 ZX. The shape parameter  was constant, leading to a constant coefficient of variation(Standard deviation/mean =1\u2044\u221a).We truncated the distribution at ^ = 25 days and computed probabilities that  was \u03c4 days as :X() =  \u2217 bd \u2264  + 0.5hX, i \u2212 d \u2264  \u2212 0.5hX, ij,where  is a normalization constant accounting for the truncation at ^.We denote the corresponding cumulative distribution function of D by X() = ( \u2264  + 0.5|X, ).Modelling cases arrival: We computed \" = n\",$o$pG,\u2026,q the daily number of cases arriving fromlocation  on date t that had been detected before time T, and \" = \u2211$ \",$ the total number of suchcases arriving from location .Due to the time lag between arrival and confirmation, some cases arriving on time t from location Scan be undetected as of time T.

We computed the number G of transmission clusters where a seedof size 1 was among the cases identified in the cluster and likewise H with seeds of size >1. We alsocomputed the number J of imported cases that did not start a transmission cluster and the number of clusters for which a seed was not observed among the tested cases, i.e. clusters without a directlink to an imported case.Modeling index case detection: We assumed that seeds could be of size 1 with probability  or of size2 with probability 1 \u2212 . A seed could be observed with probability  and started a cluster withprobability .The number J of imported cases that did not start a cluster consist of y1 and y2 seeds of size 1 and 2such that y1 + 2 y2 = J and y1 + y2 = ; however the grouping of these cases is unknown. Wecomputed y out of J using a plug-in estimate where the mean of the fraction y1/y2 was /(1 \u2212 ), i.e. = J/(2 \u2212 ).Denote  the number of seeds of any size that went undetected and did not give start to a cluster,with probability: (1 \u2212 )(1 \u2212 ).  is latent and estimated together with ,  and .Likelihood function: The likelihood is based on a multinomial distribution for G, H, ,  and :( = (, , ), )|G, H, , )(G+H +  +  + )!=G!

We developed a statistical model to nowcast trends in importationsand quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. The full database, along with thedatabase describing clusters, were made publicly available16.For imported cases with full information on the timeline of events, we computed the average durationfrom travel to onset, from travel to hospitalization, and from hospitalization to reporting. We extended the analysis to all imported cases combining cases with full and partialinformation on the timeline. We modeled imported cases over time as a piecewise exponential function dependingon the source and on travel restrictions in place. Complete information was available for 51 (31%) imported cases, with quality ofinformation decreasing over time (Figure S1 of the Appendix).Among imported cases with full information, the delay from travel to hospitalization was longer incases that generated secondary transmissions (mean of 10 \u00b1 0.97 days compared to 5.5 \u00b1 0.67 days,p=0.003). Durations of hospitalization were instead comparable among thetwo groups of cases (1.5 \u00b1 0.7 days vs. 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 days for cases that generated or did not generatesecondary transmissions, respectively). Imported casesafter February 13, 2020 are in agreement with model predictions (Fig.3).Forty-two transmission clusters were identified out of China in the timeframe under study. Clusters were grouped according to whether theindex case: (i) was a traveling case identified prior to cluster detection; (ii) a traveling case notidentified or identified retrospectively once the cluster was observed; (iii) completely unknown. To contain it globally, identification, rapid management of cases, and contact tracing arekey. We identified salient epidemiologicalfeatures, and modeled the number of importations over time. Such difference is likely an outcome of theimplementation of containment measures in China3,20,21, and of the increased awareness at differentphases of the outbreak22\u201326 (i.e. before and after containment measures) leading to self-isolation andquarantine. Our model predicts that exportations will likely rise from areas outside China. ECDC and WHO currently base their case definition on travel from Chinaonly30,31, but this may rapidly change in the next days. Our estimates indicate an ability of 36% to detect imported cases in countriesoutside China.
