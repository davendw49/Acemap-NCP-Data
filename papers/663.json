This can cause serious illness anddeath (                  Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and was named 2019-nCoV (        The daily confirmed cases of COVID-2019 from January 22th, 2020 to March 1 , 2020 werethcollectedfromtheofficialwebsiteofdevelop ARIMA model.          A total number of 41 (from January 22th, 2020 to March 1 , 2020) days were collected tothThe ARIMA models are important techniques in time series analysis that could be used in autocorrelated data analysis. These models include autoregressive (AR) model, moving average(MA) model, and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model (                    The parameters of ARIMA model is as follows: (p, d, q)(P,D,Q)S generally, p refers to the orderof auto-regression, d refers the degree of trend difference, q refers to the order of movingaverage, P refers to the seasonal auto-regression lag, D refers to the degree of seasonaldifference, Q refers to the seasonal moving average, S refers to the length of the cyclicalpattern(                    Before analyzing, time series must become station-based on mean and variance. The AugmentedDickey-Fuller (ADF) is used (                    All the models that passed the residual test (normality and stationary in variance) were comparedusing Akaike information criterion (AIC). The model which has the least AIC was selected as thebest model. The methodology of current study was based on a previous study as reference (          Since no primary data collection was undertaken, no patient or public was involved; no formalethical assessment or informed consent was required. All data were collected from the officialwebsite and all data were fully anonymized.of these ACF and PACF showed that confirmed cases of COVID-2019 were not influenced bythe seasonality. According to these plots the P and Q parameters of ARIMA models wereguessed. Then the guess models were compared according to AIC value.The final models that were reported in table 2 had the lowest AIC values. Table 2 shows theforecast plots of ARIMA models for different countries with high number of confirmed casesaccording to WHO regions. The closes of predicted plots with actual confirmed data could beobserved in these plots. This shows the precision of models in forecasting.high confirmed cases in different world regions (WHO regions)PlotIranARIMATable 3 shows the forecast for 17 days (from 5thof March until 21thof March) with 95%confidence interval for different countries. This table shows that China may have stable trendafter 6th of March. South Korea presented a downward trend after 15th of March. This hope isstrong that this trend remains stable in near future in this country. Thailand almost controlled theepidemic and had zero or one confirmed cases daily. Iran and Italy did not have a stable trend inthese 17 days.The confirmed cases trend in China may become stable. South Korea will have a stationary trendin near future. Thailand almost controlled and the confirmed cases for this country werefrequently between zero and one. Iran and Italy had unstable trend.          China\u2019s confirmed cases showed stationary trend after 6th of March. This result is in accordancewith the result of previous study that predicted China\u2019s epidemic to end up after March 10th,2020(          This study confirmed that South Korea had an almost moderate trend that became decreasingafter 15th of March.          Iran did not have stationary trend even after 15th of March. In a study according to the passengersthat came from other countries such as UAE, Lebanon, and Canada the prevalence of cases inIran estimated about 18,300 cases assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in thecountry(          Thailand had the best control system in the exposure of this epidemic. Checking their programcould be the best guide for future epidemics.Although more data are needed to have a more detailed prevision, these models could be helpfulin predicting future confirmed cases if the spread of the virus did not change very strangely. Aswe know this virus is novel and have the ability to be transmitted severely. This ability mayaffect all the predictions, but to our knowledge and for the time of writing, these models are thebest.Mainland China and Thailand were successful in haltering COVID-19 epidemic. South Koreawas also shown decreasing trend and may control this epidemic in near future.
