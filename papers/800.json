Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3'fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anticoronavirus agents.", "text": "formed, which is responsible for making more copies of the RNA genome via a negative-sense RNAintermediate, as well as the structural and other proteins encoded by the viral genome. The viral RNA ispackaged into viral coats in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex, after which exocytosisresults in release of viral particles for subsequent infectious cycles. Potential inhibitors have been designed totarget nearly every stage of this process.3 However, despite decades of research, no effective drug is currentlyapproved to treat serious coronavirus infections such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.One of the most important druggable targets for coronaviruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp). This polymerase is highly conserved at the protein level among different positive sense RNAviruses, to which coronaviruses and HCV belong, and shares common structural features in these viruses.5Like RdRps in other viruses, the coronavirus enzyme is highly error-prone,6 which might increase its abilityto accept modified nucleotide analogues. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogues that inhibit polymerases arean important group of anti-viral agents.7-10Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures andactivities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA(Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.2 Sofosbuvir is a pyrimidinenucleotide analogue prodrug with a hydrophobic masked phosphate group enabling it to enter infectedeukaryotic cells, and then converted into its active triphosphate form by cellular enzymes (Fig. 1). In thisactivated form, it inhibits the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B.11,12 The activated drug(2\u2019F,Me-UTP) binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporated into RNA, and due to fluoro andmethyl modifications at the 2\u2019 position, inhibits further RNA chain extension, thereby halting RNAreplication and stopping viral growth. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with naturalribonucleotides. Velpatasvir inhibits NS5A, a key protein required for HCV replication. NS5A enhances thefunction of RNA polymerase NS5B during viral RNA synthesis.13,14ONNHOHOOOH FNucleosideslownucleoside kinaseOHO P OOHOOH FONNHONucleoside monophosphatefastnucleotidyl and nucleosidyldiphosphate kinaseO O OHO P O P O P OOH OH OHOONNHOOH F2\u2019-F,Me-UTPActive nucleoside triphosphatefast celluar enzymesOO P ONHO OOOH FSofosbuvir (a prodrug)ONNHOThere are many other RNA polymerase inhibitors that have been evaluated as antiviral drugs. A relatedpurine nucleotide prodrug, Remdesivir (Fig. 2b), was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections,though not successfully, and is currently in clinical trials for treating COVID-19.15,16 In contrast to Sofosbuvir(Fig. 2a), both the 2\u2019- and 3\u2019-OH groups in Remdesivir (Fig. 2b) are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1\u2019position serves to inhibit the RdRp in the active triphosphate form. In addition to the use of hydrophobicgroups to mask the phosphate in the Protide-based prodrug strategy,17 as with Sofosbuvir and Remdesivir,there are other classes of nucleoside prodrugs including those based on ester derivatives of the ribosehydroxyl groups to enhance cellular delivery.18,19The replication cycle of HCV4 is very similar to that of the coronaviruses.3 Analyzing the structure of theactive triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (Fig. 2a) compared to that of Remdesivir (Fig. 2b), both of whichhave already been shown to inhibit the replication of specific RNA viruses (Sofosbuvir for HCV, Remdesivirfor SARS-CoV-2), we noted in particular that the 2\u2019-modifications in Sofosbuvir (a fluoro and a methylgroup) are substantially smaller than the 1\u2019-cyano group and the 2\u2019-OH group in Remdesivir. The bulkycyano group in close proximity to the 2\u2019-OH may lead to steric hindrance that will impact the incorporationefficiency of the activated form of Remdesivir. Interestingly, it was recently reported that, using theMERSCoV polymerase, the triphosphate of Remdesivir was preferentially incorporated relative to ATP in solutionassays.20 Nevertheless, it has been shown that the active triphosphate form of Remdesivir does not causecomplete polymerase reaction termination and actually delays polymerase termination in Ebola virus andrespiratory syncytial virus, likely due to its 1\u2019-cyano group and the free 2\u2019-OH and 3\u2019-OH groups.20,21Compared to the active form of Sofosbuvir (2\u2019-fluoro-2\u2019-methyl-UTP), two other nucleotide inhibitors withrelated structures were reviewed: 2\u2019-fluoro-UTP is incorporated by polymerase, but RNA synthesis maycontinue past the incorporated nucleotide analogue;22 2\u2019-C-methyl-UTP has been shown to terminate thereaction catalyzed by HCV RdRp,22 but proofreading mechanisms can revert this inhibition in mitochondrialDNA-dependent RNA polymerases.23 Additionally, HCV develops resistance to 2\u2019-C-methyl-UTP due tomutations of the RdRp.24 A computational study published in 201725 considered the ability of variousantiHCV drugs to dock in the active site of SARS and MERS coronavirus RdRps as potential inhibitors.Recently, Elfiky used a computational approach to predict that Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, andRemidisvir might be potent drugs against COVID-19.26Thus, based on our analysis of the biological pathways of hepatitis C and coronaviruses, the molecularstructures and activities of viral inhibitors, model polymerase and SARS-CoV RdRp extension experimentsdescribed below, and the efficacy of Sofosbuvir in inhibiting the HCV RdRp, we expect that Sofosbuvir orits modified forms should also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.2The active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (2\u2019-F,Me-UTP) was shown to be incorporated by HCV RdRp andprevent any further incorporation by this polymerase.22,27 Other viral polymerases have also been shown toincorporate active forms of various anti-viral prodrugs to inhibit replication.28 Since, at the time of thepreparation of this manuscript, we did not have access to the RdRp from SARS-CoV-2, we first selected twogroups of polymerases to test the termination efficiency of the active form of Sofosbuvir, one group withhigh fidelity behavior with regard to incorporation of modified nucleotide analogues, which one wouldexpect for host cell polymerases, the other group with low fidelity mimicking viral polymerases, as well asthe RdRp from SARS-CoV, the virus causing the 2003 and subsequent outbreaks of SARS. Our rationale isthat the low fidelity viral-like enzymes would incorporate 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP and stop further replication, whilethe high fidelity polymerases, typical of host cell polymerases, would not. Experimental proof fortermination of the SARS-CoV polymerase catalyzed RNA replication would provide further support for thisrationale, indicating that Sofosbuvir or its modified forms will inhibit SARS-CoV-2.We first carried out DNA polymerase extension reactions with the active form of Sofosbuvir (2\u2019-F,Me-UTP)using Thermo Sequenase as an example of high fidelity, host-like polymerases, and two mutated DNApolymerases which are known to be more promiscuous in their ability to incorporate modified nucleotides,Therminator II and Therminator IX, as examples of viral-like low fidelity enzymes. A DNA template-primercomplex, in which the next two available bases were A (Fig. 3), was incubated with either 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP(structure shown in Fig. 2a), or dTTP as a positive control, in the appropriate polymerase buffer. If the2\u2019F,Me-UTP is incorporated and inhibits further incorporation, a single-base primer extension product will beproduced. By contrast, dTTP incorporation will result in primer extension by 2 bases. After performing thereactions, we determined the molecular weight of the extension products using MALDI-TOF-massspectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).As seen in Figs. 3a and 3b, when the primer-template complex (sequences shown at top of Fig. 3) and2\u2019F,Me-UTP were incubated with the low fidelity 9oN polymerase mutants,29-31 Therminator II (T2) andTherminator IX (T9), we observed single product peaks with molecular weights of 5492 Da and 5488 Da,indicating single base extension in the polymerase reaction. Thus 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP was able to be incorporatedand block further nucleotide incorporation. In contrast, when the extension reactions were carried out withhigh-fidelity Thermo Sequenase DNA polymerase (TS),32 there was no incorporation, as evidenced by asingle primer peak at 5172 Da (Fig. 3c). This supports our rationale that Thermo Sequenase, a high fidelityenzyme originally designed for accurate Sanger sequencing, will not incorporate 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, while alowfidelity polymerase, such as T2 and T9, will incorporate 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP and stop further nucleotideincorporation. When dTTP was used as a positive control with these three enzymes, incorporation continuedpast the first A in the template, resulting in a higher molecular weight peak.These results demonstrate that lower fidelity polymerases will have a high likelihood of incorporating2\u2019F,Me-UTP and inhibit viral RNA replication, whereas high fidelity enzymes, more typical of the host DNAand RNA polymerases, will have a low likelihood of being inhibited by 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP. Anti-viral drug designbased on this principle may lead to potent viral polymerase inhibitors with fewer side effects. To providefurther proof that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp might be inhibited by 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, we next tested the ability of thismolecule to be incorporated into an RNA primer to terminate the reaction catalyzed by the RdRp fromSARS-CoV, using an RNA template. As shown in Fig. 4a, the active triphosphate form of the drug not onlywas incorporated by the RdRp, but prevented further incorporation, behaving as a terminator in thepolymerase reaction.Based on our similar insight related to their molecular structures and previous antiviral activity studies, incomparison with Sofosbuvir, we selected the triphosphate forms of Alovudine (3\u2019-deoxy-3\u2019-fluorothymidine)and azidothymidine (AZT, the first FDA approved drug for HIV/AIDS) for evaluation as inhibitors of theSARS-CoV RdRp. These two molecules share a similar backbone structure (base and ribose) to Sofosbuvir,but have fewer modification sites and less steric hindrance. Furthermore, because these modifications onAlovudine and AZT are on the 3\u2019 carbon in place of the OH group, they directly prevent furtherincorporation of nucleotides leading to permanent termination of RNA synthesis and replication of the virus.Alovudine is one of the most potent inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase and HIV-1 replication. Thispromising drug was discontinued after a Phase II trial due to its hematological toxicity.33 However,subsequent in vitro studies showed Alovudine was very effective at suppressing severalnucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-resistant HIV-1 mutants.34 New clinical studieswere then carried out in which low doses of Alovudine were given as supplements to patients showingevidence of infection by NRTI resistant HIV strains and not responding well to their current drug regimen. A4-week course of 2 mg/day Alovudine reduced viral load significantly, and was relatively well tolerated withno unexpected adverse events.35AZT is another antiretroviral medication which has long been used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS.36-38 Uponentry into the infected cells, similar to Alovudine, cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective5'triphosphate form (3\u2019-N3-dTTP, structure shown in Fig. 2d), which competes with dTTP for incorporationinto DNA by HIV-reverse transcriptase resulting in termination of HIV's DNA synthesis.39 Since the sideeffects and toxicity of AZT are well understood, novel methodologies have been directed at enhancing AZTplasma levels and its bioavailability in all human organs in order to improve its therapeutic efficacy. Amongthese possibilities, an AZT prodrug strategy was proposed.40We thus assessed the ability of 3\u2019-N3-dTTP and 3\u2019-F-dTTP, the active triphosphate forms of AZT andAlovudine, along with 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp into an RNA primer andterminate the polymerase reaction.The RdRp of SARS-CoV, referred to as nsp12, and its two protein cofactors, nsp7 and nsp8, shown to berequired for the processive polymerase activity of nsp12, were cloned and purified as described.41,42 Thesethree viral gene products have high homology (e.g., 96% identity and 98% similarity for nsp12, with similarhomology levels at the amino acid level for nsp7 and nsp8) to the equivalent gene products fromSARSCoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. A detailed description of the homologies of nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12is included in Extended Data Fig. 1 which highlights key functional motifs in nsp12 described byKirchdoerfer and Ward.42 Of these, Motifs A, B, E, F and G are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 atthe amino acid level, and Motifs C and D display only conservative substitutions.We performed polymerase extension assays with 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, 3\u2019-F-dTTP, 3\u2019-N3-dTTP or UTP followingthe addition of an pre-annealed RNA template and primer to a pre-assembled mixture of the RdRp (nsp12)and two cofactor proteins (nsp7 and nsp8). The extended primer products from the reaction were subjected toMALDI-TOF-MS analysis. The RNA template and primer, corresponding to the N1 epitope region of the Nprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, were used for the polymerase assay, and their sequences are indicated atthe top of Fig. 4. Because there are two As in a row in the next available positions of the template for RNApolymerase extension downstream of the priming site, if the 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, 3\u2019-F-dTTP or 3\u2019-N3-dTTP areincorporated by the viral RdRp, a single nucleotide analogue will be added to the 3\u2019-end of the primer strand.If they are indeed inhibitors of the polymerase, the extension should stop after this incorporation; further3\u2019extension should be prevented. In the case of the UTP control reaction, two UTP\u2019s should be incorporated.As shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2, this is exactly what we observed. In the MALDI-TOF MStrace in Fig. 4a, a peak indicative of the molecular weight of a one-base 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP analogue primerextension product was obtained (7217 Da observed, 7214 Da expected). Similarly, in the trace in Fig. 4b, asingle extension peak indicative of a single-base extension by 3\u2019-F-dTTP is revealed (7203 Da observed,7198 Da expected), with no further incorporation. And in the trace in Fig. 4c, a single extension peakindicative of a single-base extension by 3\u2019-N3-dTTP is seen (7227 Da observed, 7218 Da expected), with noevidence of further incorporation. As a positive control, extension by 2 UTPs occurred (7506 Da observed,7504 Da expected) in the MALDI-TOF MS trace in Extended Data Fig. 2.In summary, these results demonstrate that the nucleotide analogues 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, 3\u2019-F-dTTP and3\u2019-N3dTTP, are permanent terminators for the SARS-CoV RdRp. Their prodrug versions (Sofosbuvir,3\u2019-F-5\u2019-Ophosphoramidate dT nucleoside and 3\u2019-N3-5\u2019-O-phosphoramidate dT nucleoside) can be readily synthesizedusing the ProTide prodrug approach, as shown in Fig. 2a, c and d, and can be developed as therapeutics forboth SARS and COVID-19.Fig. 4 | Incorporation of 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, 3\u2019-F-dTTP and 3\u2019-N3-dTTP by SARS-CoV RdRp to terminatethe polymerase reaction. The sequence of the primer and template used for these extension reactions, whichare within the N1 coding sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, is shown at the top of the figure.Polymerase extension reactions were performed by incubating (a) 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, (b) 3\u2019-F-dTTP, and (c)3\u2019N3-dTTP with pre-assembled SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8), the indicated RNA templateand primer, and the appropriate reaction buffer, followed by detection of reaction products by MALDI-TOFMS. The detailed procedure is shown in the Methods section. For comparison, data for extension with UTPare presented in Extended Data Fig. 2. The accuracy for m/z determination is \u00b1 10 Da.One factor that has confounded the development of RdRp inhibitors in coronaviruses is the presence of a3\u2019exonuclease-based proofreading activity such as that associated with nsp14, a key component of thereplication-transcription complex in SARS-CoV,43,44 and also encoded in SARS-CoV-2. This exonucleaseactivity can be overcome with the use of 2\u2019-O-methylated nucleotides.43 Importantly, since both Sofosbuvirand AZT are FDA approved drugs, where toxicity tests have already been performed, they can be evaluatedquickly in laboratory and clinical settings.We have recently described2 a strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combiningthe ProTide Prodrug approach17 used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3\u2019-blocking groupsthat we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as terminators for DNA sequencing bysynthesis.29,30,45 We reasoned that (i) the hydrophobic phosphate masking groups will allow entry of thecompounds into the virus-infected cells, (ii) the 3\u2019-blocking group on the 3\u2019-OH with either free 2\u2019-OH ormodifications at the 2\u2019 position will encourage incorporation of the activated triphosphate analogue by viralpolymerases but not host cell polymerases, thus reducing any side effects, and (iii) once incorporated, furtherextension will be prevented by virtue of the 3\u2019-blocking group, thereby completely inhibiting viral replicationand potentially overcoming the development of resistance due to the accumulation of new mutations in theRdRp.46Our design criterion is to identify groups for attachment to the 3\u2019-OH with appropriate structural andchemical properties (e.g., size, shape, rigidity, flexibility, polarity, reactivity [e.g., stability to cellularenzymes]),47,48 along with appropriate 2\u2019-substitutions, so that they will be incorporated by the viral RdRp,while minimizing incorporation by the host polymerases. We previously used this chemical and structuralprinciple to select a variety of chemical moieties that block the 3\u2019-OH of the nucleotide analogues aspolymerase terminators.31,49,50In conclusion, we demonstrated the capability of more tolerant DNA polymerases, as well as SARS CoVRNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is nearly identical to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp responsible forCOVID-19, to incorporate 2\u2019-F,Me-UTP, the active form of Sofosbuvir, where it serves to terminate thepolymerase reaction. We also showed two other nucleotide triphosphates, 3\u2019-F-dTTP, the active form ofAlovudine, and 3\u2019-N3-dTTP, the active form of AZT, can also be incorporated and terminate furthernucleotide extension by the RdRp in the polymerase reaction, potentially preventing further replication of thevirus. Prodrug versions of these compounds and their derivatives therefore can be developed as potentbroadspectrum therapeutics for coronavirus infectious diseases, including SARS, MERS and COVID-19.32.

Protein sequences are from NCBI Protein Database, accession ID\u2019s as indicated. Sequences werealigned with blastp.51 Consensus is shown in blue between the query and subject sequences; positions of aminoacid substitutions are in red; + indicates conservative amino acid substitutions involving amino acids with closephysico-chemical properties. (A) nsp7; (B) nsp8; (C) nsp12: functional motifs42 are shown as colored barsunderneath the aligned sequences. Comparison of the polymerase complex components (nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12proteins) shows that these proteins are very similar in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are no indels inany of the three protein pairs. There is only one amino acid substitution in nsp7 (99% sequence identity); nsp8has 5 amino acid changes (97% sequence identity), out of which 3 are between amino acids with similarproperties. Alignment of the nsp12 pair shows that 898 out of 932 amino acids (96%) are identical betweenSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the substitutions are between amino acids with similarphysicochemical properties, therefore the level of similarity is higher, at 98%. Most of the amino acid substitutions(24 out of 34) are located within the N-terminal portion of the nsp12 protein. This region corresponds to theNiRAN domain (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase; approximately amino acids 1 through 250)which is also less conservative in other coronaviruses.5 Within the next region (the interface domain, aa ~250through 400), the first 15 amino acid positions have multiple substitutions, but the rest of the interface domainis quite conservative. The region beyond the interface domain, corresponding to the nsp12 C-terminus, containspolymerase functional domains. These domains constitute the canonical fingers, palm, and thumb of thepolymerase enzyme and contain several motifs that are conservative among coronaviruses (Motifs A throughF). Out of the 34 amino acid substitutions in the nsp12 between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, only threesubstitutions are located within these motifs, and all three are between similar amino acids.Extended Data Fig. 2 | Incorporation of UTP by SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
