NDT (2020)COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a majorglobal human threat that has turned into a pandemic. Thisnovel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderlyand in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on dialysiscombine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden ofcomorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients arerepeatedly treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres).Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiringspecialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirementsfor isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systemsunder exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures toslow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to controlunmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aimof the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL)Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendationsfor the prevention, mitigation and containment inhaemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. Themanagement of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must becarried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk forother patients and personnel taking care of these patients.Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation anddistribution have been shown to be efficient in similar settings.They are essential in the management of the pandemic andshould be taken in the early stages of the disease.An epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (COVID-19), a new strand of thecoronavirus family, originated from Wuhan (China) in December2019, and was declared a pandemic by the World HealthOrganization as of 11 March 2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). The globalpandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is quickly affecting thedelivery of health care worldwide [                In the first two decades of this century, three members of thecoronavirus family, Severe Acute RespiratorySyndromeCorona Virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East RespiratorySyndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, havecaused three major pandemic outbreaks of infectiousrespiratory diseases. At the present time, it is believed thatSARS-CoV2 is more contagious, but with a lower case fatality rate than theother two viruses. Compared with the previous two outbreaks,the epidemic area of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 islarger, the number of infected people and, consequently, thenumber of deaths higher, and the strain on the healthcaresystem, as well as the global economic loss, greater [                Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragilityand a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specificsetting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the samearea (haemodialysis centres). Dialysis patients constitute asusceptible population because of their older age and their lessefficient immune system, and they are therefore more prone todevelop severe infectious diseases than the general population[                To the best of our knowledge, at the time of writing of thisarticle (14 March 2020), only one series of cases from onehaemodialysis centre in Wuhan has been published [                Isolation practices can be effective for preventing secondarytransmission of viruses closely related to COVID-19. Forinstance, during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea,although 116 participants in three haemodialysis units wereincidentally exposed to the virus, strict patient surveillance andproper isolation practice prevented secondary transmissions[        COVID-19 infection in patients treated in dialysis centrespresents a particular challenge as the risk of transmission to themedical staff, facility workers, other patients and to familymembers is significantly increased.        The Chinese Society of Nephrology [        R E C O M M E N D A T I O N SHealthcare team\u2022 A working team consisting of dialysis physicians, nursingstaff and technicians should receive training in updatedclinical knowledge of the COVID-19 epidemic, epidemicprevention tools and guidelines from the government,scientific societies and hospital authorities. Instructionsshould include how to use the different types offacemasks, how to use tissues to cover the nose and mouthwhen coughing or sneezing, how to dispose of tissues andcontaminated items in waste receptacles, and how andwhen to perform hand hygiene. Training can be donepeer to peer or online.\u2022 Latest care recommendations and epidemic informationshould be updated and delivered to all medical carepersonnel as needed.\u2022 Staff members should self-monitor their symptoms (ifany) and should inform the team leader in case they ortheir family members develop symptom(s) suggestive ofCOVID-19 infection. Sick members of the team shouldstay at home, and in any case should not be in contactwith patients or other team members.\u2022 Nurses should be trained to take nasopharynx swabs forCOVID-19 polymerase chain reaction, with appropriatedressing using a filtering face piece 2 (FFP2) mask(filtering 95% of particulate matter and aerosols in inhaled air),goggles, mobcap, disposable surgical blouse and gloves.Dialysis patients and dialysis facilities\u2022 Dialysis patients should be instructed to stay at homewhile off dialysis and on their non-dialysis days, to useindividual transport to and from dialysis facilities, to avoidpublic transportation, to abstain from travelling aroundthe country, to avoid personal contact, and to abstainfrom public, private or religious events (family reunions,marriages, funerals, etc.). Parents and grandparents ondialysis may want to abstain from personal contactespecially with their children and grandchildren, because theyounger population serves as a vector of the disease oftenwithout showing symptoms.\u2022 Dialysis facilities should provide patients with instructions(in appropriate languages) about hand hygiene,respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Instructions shouldinclude how to use facemasks, how to use tissues to coverthe nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, how toRecommendations against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemicdispose of, preferably disposable paper, tissues andcontaminated items in waste receptacles, and how and whento perform hand hygiene. Dispensers of hydroalcoholicsolutions should be installed in waiting rooms. Patientsmust be educated and encouraged to perform handhygiene at least on arrival and at the time of departure fromthe unit and if in contact with respiratory secretions.Dialysis facilities should have space in waiting areas for illpatients to sit separated from other patients by at least 2m. Medically stable patients might opt to wait in apersonal vehicle or outside the healthcare facility. Twometres separation between dialysis stations is advisable.\u2022 Treatment and waiting areas should have good airconditioning and ventilation to remove particles and aerosoldroplets from the air.\u2022 Body temperature should be systematically measuredbefore the start and at the end of the dialysis session in allpatients.\u2022 Early recognition and isolation of individuals withrespiratory infection are mandatory: (i) dialysis facilitiesshould identify patients with signs and symptoms of fever,cough, upper airway involvement or conjunctivitis beforethey enter the waiting room and treatment area; (ii)patients must inform staff of fever or respiratorysymptoms before arrival at the facility by phone or appropriateelectronic means; thus, the facility can be prepared fortheir arrival (preferably they should be seen in a first aiddepartment and not in a dialysis department) or triagethem to a more appropriate setting such as an acute carehospital; (iii) patients with respiratory symptoms shouldbe brought to an appropriate treatment area as soon aspossible to minimize the time in waiting areas; (iv) allpatients who have fever, cough, upper airway involvementor conjunctivitis should be screened for novel COVID-19infection. For sampling, patients should be either in asingle-patient room or in a room dedicated to sampling.Disinfection of the room after sampling is mandatory.\u2022 Ideally, symptomatic patients should be dialysed in aseparate isolation room (if available), in which a negativepressure atmosphere can be established, with the doorclosed. Otherwise, they should wait in a separate isolationroom and receive dialysis in the last shift of the day untilinfection is excluded. He/she should wear a proper(surgical or N95) mask filtering 95% of the particulate matter<2.5 mm in the aerosol of exhaled air.\u2022 Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection should beadmitted to an airborne infection isolation room andshould not receive dialysis in an outpatient dialysisfacility, unless an airborne infection isolation room isavailable. All personnel involved in the direct care of patientsaffected by COVID-19 must undertake full protection,including long-sleeved waterproof isolation clothing, haircaps, goggles, gloves and medical masks (FFP2 or FFP3mask if available) filtering 95\u201399% of particulate matterand aerosols in inhaled air. Hand hygiene must be strictlyimplemented, carefully washing hands with soap andwater and systematically using alcoholic solutions anddisposable gloves.\u2022 Consideration should be given to cohorting more thanone patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 andthe healthcare team caring for them in the same section ofthe unit and/or on the same shift (e.g. consider the lastshift of the day). Avoid, however, mixing of suspected andconfirmed cases.\u2022 Manpower should be cohorted in separate teams for themanagement of high-risk and low-risk patients. Only theassigned healthcare team should enter the isolation room/cohort area, all non-scheduled team-mates should beexcluded at all times.\u2022 If a newly confirmed or highly suspected case of novelcoronavirus infection in dialysis centres is identified,disinfection must be carried out immediately. Areas in closecontact with these patients must not be used for otherpatients until cleared.\u2022 The medical waste from confirmed or suspected patientswith novel coronavirus infection must be considered asinfectious medical waste and disposed of accordingly.Duration of isolation precautions for patients underinvestigation for or with confirmed COVID-19\u2022 Discontinuation of isolation precautions should bedetermined on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with local,state and federal health authorities, until the informationis available regarding viral shedding after clinicalimprovement.\u2022 Factors to be considered include presence of symptomsrelated to COVID-19 infection, date when symptomsresolved, other conditions that require specific precautions(e.g., tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile), other laboratoryinformation reflecting clinical status and alternatives toinpatient isolation, such as the possibility of safe recoveryat home.\u2022 Patients who need vascular access surgery should bescreened for COVID-19. Operations on patients withconfirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection must be carriedout in a designated room with necessary protection formedical staff.          Operational strategies for family members andcaregivers\u2022 All family members living with dialysis patients mustfollow all precautions and regulations given to patients toprevent person-to-person and within-family transmissionof the COVID-19, which include body temperaturemeasurement, good personal hygiene, handwashing andprompt reporting of potentially infected individuals.\u2022 Dialysis patients who have a family member or caregiversubject to quarantine (precautionary isolation\u2014basicallyfor 14 days\u2014because of a potential exposition to thecoronavirus but not showing any signs of infection) [                    \u2022 These patients should be assisted at home as far as ispossible, using telereporting assistance or other electronicsystems for clinical management and to supplementhome visits by healthcare staff, as deemed necessary.C O N C L U S I O N SCOVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus, is a majorglobal human threat that has turned into a pandemic.
