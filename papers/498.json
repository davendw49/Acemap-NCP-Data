Beyond the classic preventionmeasures, strict adherence to suggested precautionsshould also be followed to prevent transmission. Despitespecific sanitary measures at airports and frontiers, wemust be able to respond appropriately to the internationalpublic health emergency declared by WHO. From ourpast experience of treating viral infections in criticallyill patients, we know the level of severity of illness inpatients infected by coronavirus depends on the presenceof comorbidities and immune status of the host. On theone hand, anergic patients are likely to develop a severeclinical response; on the other hand, an excessive immuneresponse might also add to severity through a generalisedinflammatory status. In both cases, immune dysregulationcan lead to a progressive cascade of pathophysiologicalevents leading to critical illness with multiple organdysfunction.Because it is not possible to anticipate the extent ofthe epidemic and the consequent number of patientswho require intensive care management, intensive careclinicians must be prepared to provide specific organsupport treatments and to consider that this type oftreatment might be necessary for a large number ofpatients. Extracorporeal therapies can be helpful tosupport diferent organs, such as the lungs, heart, kidneys,and liver, through the application of specific devices.Venovenous ECMO is a complex and sophisticatedsupport for treatment of the most severe forms ofacute hypoxaemic respiratory failure; it is performedin specialised, experienced referral centres that arecommonly organised into networks, serving large regionsor whole countries. The number of critically ill individualswho are infected with 2019-nCoV and who will requireECMO is unknown. In some regions, more than in others, ashortness of ECMO devices could occur and might imposechoices that come with important ethical questions.Without predefined criteria to guide the decision onwho will get the treatment and in what order, this willlead unavoidably to a first-come-first-serve approach.Clinical presentation, comorbidities, age, number of daysof mechanical ventilation before indication for ECMO,and risk for complications are all factors influencing apotentially favourable outcome. 2019-nCoV might alsocause severe myocarditis resulting in acute heart failure,which might indicate, in the most severe forms, the needfor venous-arterial ECMO support.Extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) is a techniquethat can be performed in more ICUs due to the muchlower level of complexity than is required for ECMO, butECCO2R is not really helpful for severely hypoxaemicpatients who actually need full ECMO treatment. Acutekidney injury in these patients is not common, but itmight result from a systemic inflammatory syndromeinvolving combined myocardial and kidney function. Inthese cases, continuous renal replacement therapies byhaemofiltration and haemo diafiltration can contributeto resolution of organ failure. Liver dysfunction canalso rarely occur in patients with severe viral infectionand it might require extracorporeal blood purificationtechniques to support the patient until hepatocyterecovery occurs. Finally, a sepsis-like syndromemight occur frequently due to the virus itself or to asuperimposed bacterial infection and in this case, sincepharmacological approaches have shown poor results,new extracorporeal organ support therapies including For more on ECCO2R see Reviewhaemoadsorption and haemoperfusion, with new Lancet Respir Med 2018; 6: 874\u201384sorbent cartridges designed to remove cytokines and For more on ECCO2R removal seeother circulating mediators, should be considered.

But thenher feet and hands started to turn purple. In fact, she hadcontracted bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcuspneumoniae and was admitted to Howard County General(Columbia, MD), where she was eventually diagnosedwith sepsis. At the time, in April 2019, Michelle was ahealthy, active 48-year-old, with a passion for gardening,who worked at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory(Laurel, MD, US) as an engineer.Initially, antibiotics gave her some respite, but whenher vision started to deteriorate, she was transferred toJohns Hopkins Hospital. The doctors treated her sightloss but when she experienced breathing dificulties,she was transferred to intensive care, intubated, andsedated. 2 days later she was extubated, but with furtherrespiratory problems she was back in critical care after2 days. With a total of 4 days on mechanical ventilation,and 10 days after her first admission, Michelle\u2019s lifehad become fragile and tenuous. \u201cI can only describeit as being like a dream\u201d, she says, \u201conly when I left thehospital, did I really fully appreciate how dangerous it hadall been\u201d.Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU), is characterisedby an acute onset of intense confusion and is extremelycommon in critical care, particularly for those patientson mechanical ventilation. Patients are in a dream-likestate, which can lead on to hallucinations, delusions, andparanoia. Alarmingly, delirium can often go undiagnosed,despite its association with post-traumatic stress disorder,higher risk of long-term cognitive damage, and lowersurvival rates. In her delirium, Michelle was convincedshe was the star of a medical drama TV show\u2014she didnot believe the doctors were doctors and was aggravatedshe was not being given her breaks from her acting role.She laughs when she retells the story, but delirium is verydisorientating in an already alien environment. Eventhough she was screened for and diagnosed with ICUdelirium, Michelle\u2019s memory loss (\u201cI couldn\u2019t rememberanything, even my birthday\u201d) and inability to pass basiccognitive tests led her husband to believe she was havinga stroke.Ken, Michelle\u2019s husband, describes her illnessprogression as a \u201croller coaster\u201d\u2014periods of stability andlucidity were followed by sudden emergency intubations:\u201cmy greatest fear was her health taking a serious turn for", "ref_list": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "Transmission of 2019-nCoV is likely to occur through\nlarge droplets, which could provide an explanation for the\ninitial infection at the wet fish market in Wuhan, although\ncontact by aerosols cannot be excluded.
