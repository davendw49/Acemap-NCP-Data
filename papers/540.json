Coronavirusspike (S) glycoproteins promote entry into cells andare the main target of antibodies. We show thatthe receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 Sand SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to humanat the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, whichis processed during biogenesis and sets this virusapart from SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs.for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viralentry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV Smurine polyclonal antibodies potently inhibitedSARS          Three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier tocause deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning ofthe 21st century: severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV)                    MERS-CoV was suggested to originate from bats, but thereservoir host fueling spillover to humans is unequivocallydromedary camels                    Coronavirus entry into host cells is mediated by thetransmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein that forms homotrimersprotruding from the viral surface                    Different coronaviruses use distinct domains within the S1subunit to recognize a variety of attachment and entry receptors,depending on the viral species. Endemic human coronavirusesOC43 and HKU1 attach via their S domain A (SA) to5-Nacetyl-9-O-acetyl-sialosides found on glycoproteins andglycolipids at the host cell surface to enable entry into susceptiblecells                    As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is surface-exposed andmediates entry into host cells, it is the main target of neutralizingantibodies (Abs) upon infection and the focus of therapeuticand vaccine design. S trimers are extensively decorated withN-linked glycans that are important for proper folding                    We report here that ACE2 could mediate SARS-CoV-2S-mediated entry into cells, establishing it as a functionalreceptor for this newly emerged coronavirus. TheSARS-CoV2 SB engages human ACE2 (hACE2) with comparable affinityto SARS-CoV SB from viral isolates associated with the 2002\u20132003 epidemic (i.e., binding with high affinity to hACE2). Tightbinding to hACE2 could partially explain the efficienttransmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, as was the case forSARSCoV. We identified the presence of an unexpected furincleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 S, which iscleaved during biosynthesis\u2014a novel feature setting this virusapart from SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoVs. Abrogation of thiscleavage motif moderately affected SARS-CoV-2 S-mediatedentry into VeroE6 or BHK cells but may contribute to expandthe tropism of this virus, as reported for several highlypathogenic avian influenza viruses and pathogenic Newcastledisease virus          The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shares 76% amino acidsequence identity with the SARS-CoV S Urbani and 80%identity with bat SARSr-CoV ZXC21 S and ZC45 S glycoprotein. Thelatter two SARSr-CoV sequences were identified fromRinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats), the species from which          SARSr-CoV WIV-1 and WIV-16 wereisolated                    We set out to investigate the functional determinants ofS-mediated entry into target cells using a murine leukemia virus(MLV) pseudotyping system                    SARS-CoV-2 SBfindings                    Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S reveals the presence ofa four amino acid residue insertion at the boundary betweenthe S1 and S2 subunits compared with SARS-CoV S andSARSr-CoV S (Figure 1C). This results in the introduction of afurin cleavage site, a feature conserved among the 144SARSCoV-2 isolates sequenced to date but not in the closely relatedRaTG13 S                    SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut is therefore expected to undergoprocessing at the S1/S2 site upon encountering a target cell, similar toSARS-CoV S and SARSr-CoV S, i.e., via TMPRSS2 and/orcathepsin L                    The binding affinity of SARS-CoV for hACE2 correlates with theoverall rate of viral replication in distinct species as well as withtransmissibility and disease severity                    To understand the contribution of receptor interaction to theinfectivity of SARS-CoV-2, we characterized engagement ofhACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB side-by-side.We used biolayer interferometry to study binding kineticsand affinity of the purified hACE2 ectodomain toSARS-CoV2 SB and SARS-CoV SB immobilized at the surface ofbiosensors. We found that hACE2 bound to SARS-CoV-2 SB andSARS-CoV SB with respective equilibrium dissociationconstants of 1.2 nM (Figure 2A) and 5.0 nM (Figure 2B), andcomparable kinetic rate constants, although the off-rate, wereslightly higher for SARS-CoV SB (Table 1). The affinitydetermined here for SARS-CoV SB binding to hACE2 is in linewith prior studies and the tighter apparent interactions formedby SARS-CoV SB compared with the SARS-CoV S1 subunit orthe SARS-CoV S trimer                    To enable single-particle cryo-EM study of the SARS-CoV-2 Sglycoprotein, we designed a prefusion stabilized ectodomaintrimer construct with an abrogated furin S1/S2 cleavage site                    Approximately half of the particle images selected correspond totrimers harboring a single SB domain opened whereas theremaining half was accounted for by closed trimers with the three SBdomains closed. A recently determined SARS-CoV-2 S structurealso detected trimers with a single SB domain opened but noneentirely closed          We determined a reconstruction of theclosed SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimerat 2.8 A\u02da resolution (applying 3-foldsymmetry) and an asymmetric reconstructionof the trimer with a single SB domainopened at 3.2 A\u02da resolution (Figures 3A\u20133H and S1; Table S1). The S2 fusionmachinery is the best resolved part of themap, whereas the SA and SB domainsare less well resolved, presumablybecause of conformational heterogeneity.          The atomic model comprises residues271147, with internal breaks correspondingto flexible regions (including part of theRBM), and lacks the C-terminal mostsegment (including the heptad repeat 2)that is not visible in the map, as is the case for all S structuresdetermined to date. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain isa 160-A\u02da -long trimer with a triangular cross-section, resemblingthe closely related SARS-CoV S structure (Figures S2A\u2013S2F)                    As is the case for other b-coronavirus S glycoproteins,including SARS-CoV S          As the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S2 subunits share 88%sequence identity, they are structurally conserved and can besuperimposed with 1.2 A\u02da root-mean-square deviation (rmsd)over 417 aligned Ca positions (Figures S2E and S2F). Only themost N-terminal part of the fusion peptide is resolved in themap, as was the case for previously determined SARS-CoV SSARS-CoV S-mediated entry into targetcells. All sera tested completely inhibitedtransduction of SARS-CoV S-MLV andreduced SARS-CoV-2 S-MLVtransduction to 10% of control in VeroE6 cellsstructures.

We therefore                    We previously suggested that coronaviruses useconformational masking and glycan shielding to limit recognition by theimmune response of infected hosts                    The striking structural similarity and sequence conservationamong the SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S glycoproteinsemphasize the close relationship between these two virusesthat recognize hACE2 to enter target cells. This resemblanceis further strengthened by our finding that SARS-CoV Selicited polyclonal Ab responses, potently neutralizingSARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into cells. We surmise mostof these Abs target the highly conserved S2 subunit (includingthe fusion peptide region) based on its structural similarityacross SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the lack ofcross-reactivity of several SB-directed Abs          These findings also indicate that it might be difficult todistinguish exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from otherSARSrCoVs in serological studies using S ectodomain trimers andthat specific assays will need to be designed. Our resultsprovide a structural framework to identify conserved andaccessible epitopes across S glycoproteins that will supportongoing vaccine design efforts. Finally, elicitation of diverse,polyclonal Ab responses might prove key in light of thediversity of viruses circulating in animal reservoirs and inpreventing the possible emergence of viral neutralizationescape mutants.Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paperand include the following:d KEY RESOURCES TABLEd LEAD CONTACT AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITYd EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSB Cell linesd METHOD DETAILSB Transient expression of SARS-CoV-2 andSARSCoV SBB Transient expression of hACE2B Pseudovirus productionB Western BlottingB Pseudovirus entry assaysB Biolayer interferometryB Protein expression and purificationB CryoEM sample preparation and data collectionB Cryo-EM data processingB CryoEM model building and analysisB Immunizations with SARS-CoV Sd QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISd DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITYSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis study was supported by the National Institute of General MedicalSciences (R01GM120553 to D.V.), the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases (HHSN272201700059C to D.V.), a Pew Biomedical Scholars Award(D.V.), an Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award fromthe Burroughs Wellcome Fund (D.V.), the University of Washington Arnoldand Mabel Beckman cryoEM center, the Washington Research Foundation,and the Pasteur Institute (M.A.T.).

VeroE6 is a female kidney epithelial cell from African green monkey. BHK is akidney cell line from baby hamsters. All adherent cells were cultured at 37 C with 8% CO2 in flasks with DMEM + 10% FBS + 1%penicillin-streptomycin. Cells lines were not tested for mycoplasma contamination nor authenticated.          Transient expression of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV SBThe SARS-CoV SB construct was cloned from a SARS-CoV S ectodomain                    Expression and purification of human angiotensin-converting enzyme ectodomain (ACE2, residues 1\u2013614) fused to the Fc region ofhuman IgG (hFc) was performed as previously described                    MLV-based SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut pseudotypes were prepared as previously described          SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut pseudovirions were thawed and 4X SDS loading buffer was added priorto boiling for 10 min at 95 C. Samples were run on a 4%\u201320% gradient Tris-Glycine Gel (BioRad) and transferred to a PVDFmembrane. An anti-S2 SARS-CoV S monoclonal primary antibody (1:150 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goatanti-human or mouse secondary antibody (1:30,000 and 1:15,000 dilution respectively, Jackson Laboratory) were used for Western-blotting.A LI-COR processor was used to develop images.VeroE6 and BHK cells were cultured in 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep DMEM. BHK or VeroE6 cells were plated into 12 well plates at adensity of 0.3 3 106 for 16 h. BHK cells were either not transfected or transfected with 0.8 mg ACE2 per well using standardlipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) protocols and incubated for another 16 h. 20uL of concentrated pseudovirus was added to the wellsafter washing three times with DMEM. After 2-3 h, 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep containing DMEM was added to the cells for 48 h.Following the 48-h infection, One-Glo-EX (Promega) was added to the cells in equivalent culturing volume and incubated in thedark for 10 min prior to reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader (ThermoFisher). For entry inhibition assays, 1:100 diluted plasmawas incubated with an equal amount of pseudovirus for 30 min at room temperature prior to infection with normalized amounts ofpseudovirus added to the cells. Measurements were done in triplicate and relative luciferase units (RLU) were plotted.Assays were performed on an Octet Red (ForteBio) instrument at 30 C with shaking at 1,000 RPM. Anti-penta His biosensorswere hydrated in water for 30 min prior to a 1 min incubation in 10X kinetics buffer (undiluted). Either SARS-CoV-2 SB orSARSCoV SB were loaded at 10-20 mg/mL in 10X Kinetics Buffer for 200-900 s prior to baseline equilibration for 180 s in 10X kinetics buffer.Association of ACE2 in 10X kinetics buffer at various concentrations in a two-fold dilution series from 20nM to 2.5nM was carried outfor 1,000 s prior to dissociation for 1,000 s. The data were baseline subtracted prior to fitting performed using a 1:1 binding model andthe ForteBio data analysis software. Mean kon, koff values were determined with a global fit applied to all data. The experiments weredone with two separate purification batches of SARS-CoV SB, SARS-CoV-2-SB, and ACE2 each in duplicate and the average isreported.The SARS-CoV-2 2P S (GenBank: YP_009724390.1) ectodomain was produced in 500mL HEK293F cells grown in suspension usingFreeStyle 293 expression medium (Life technologies) at 37 C in a humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 rpm The culture wastransfected using 293fectin (ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to a density of 1 million cells per mL and cultivated for threedays. The supernatant was harvested and cells resuspended for another three days, yielding two harvests. Clarified supernatantswere purified using a 5mL Cobalt affinity column (Takara). Purified protein was filtered or concentrated and flash frozen in a buffercontaining 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl prior to cryoEM analysis.          3 mL of 0.16 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S was loaded onto a freshly glow discharged (30 s at 20 mA) lacey carbon grid with a thin layer ofevaporated continuous carbon prior to plunge freezing using a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a blot force of 1 and2.5 s blot time at 100% humidity and 25 C. Data were acquired using the Leginon software                    Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function parameters, particle picking and extraction werecarried out using Warp                    UCSF Chimera                    Immunizations with SARS-CoV S57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained at the Comparative Medicine Facility at the FredHutchinson Cancer Research Center. After collecting a pre-bleed, mice were immunized with 5mg of SARS-CoV 2P S ectodomaintrimer (this construct was previously described          Western-blots and biolayer interferometry assays were performed multiple times with at least two independent preparations ofeach sample.No methods were used to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.The cryoEM maps and atomic models have been deposited at the Electron Microscopy Data Bank and the Protein DataBank with accession codes EMD: 21452 and PDB: 6VXX (closed SARS-CoV-2 S), as well as EMD: 21457 and PDB: 6VYB(SARSCoV-2 S with one SB open).
