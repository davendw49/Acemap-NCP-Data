As of March 14, a total of 142,539 caseshad been confirmed worldwide, with many more requiring tests(2). Currently,accurate nucleic acid detection plays a pivotal role in diagnosis and prevention of454647484950515253545556575859606162636465COVID-19, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the main methodfor nucleic acid detection(3). However, it is not feasible to use this time-andlabor-consuming approach for screening a large growing number of suspected patientsand asymptomatic infected patients(4). Rapid and universal screening method isessential to savemedical resources, improve diagnosis efficiency and avoidcross-infection.Taking advantage of the emerging machine learning technique, which enables analysisof the existing multidimensional data by applying appropriate algorithms for featureexpression and classification, we have potential to improve the accuracy of diagnosis.For instance, in a recent study published in Nature, deep learning-based statisticalmodel was used to improve breast cancer treatment and survival through identifyingbreast cancer patients with a high risk of long-term recurrence(5). In this study, weanalyzed a variety of basic laboratory examinations indicators that related to hostreactions to generate a free COVID-19 diagnosis aid APP. Then, the accuracy of thisapp was validated in an independent cohort(6).We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations for work with human subjectsand the studies were approved by the Clinical Trials and Biomedical EthicsCommittee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Through the West Chinahospital, a regional medical center, we collected the information of confirmedCOVID-19 cases from various regional medical institutions, between 20th December6768697071727374757677787980818283848586872019 and 10th February 2020. Diagnostic criteria were: RT-PCR of respiratory orblood samples was positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2) nucleic acid; or viral gene sequencing of respiratory or blood samplewas highly homologous with SARS-CoV-2. Controls were patients collected in thesame site and the same time period, who were free of COVID-19 but had a diagnosisof viral pneumonia. Results of laboratory examinations on admission were collectedwhich included age, gender and 35 indicators of whole blood count, coagulation testand biochemical examination. In addition, the independent validation cohort consistedof samples collected prospectively from one single medical center, using similar datacollection strategy.Factors under consideration are age, sex and indicators of basic laboratoryexaminations(see Table 1). Using 70% samples from the derivation cohort (i.e., thetraining set), we first performed feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage andSelection Operator (LASSO) to select the valuable indicators of COVID-19. The mainidea of LASSO for feature selection is to construct a first-order penalty function,which can shrink the regression coefficient (b) of each variable within a certain range,and eliminate the feature with a coefficient of 0, and finally obtain an optimallyrefined model(7). The penalty terms for LASSO are: sum (abs(b)) <= t. Then theseindicators were used to construct a primitive model by multivariate logistic regression.The parameters were further adjusted through internal validation (i.e., the other 30%samples, the testing set) to obtain the optimized final model.8990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109In external validation cohort, we compared the predicted results, with the follow-upresults to evaluate the diagnostic validity by positive predictive values, and negativepredictive values. Finally, to facilitate further use in clinic setting, all modelparameters and code were encapsulated as a visual application(APP), COVID-19Diagnosis Aid APP.Continuous variables are represented by the median (upper and lower quartiles).Categorical variables are expressed in terms of frequency. LASSO algorithm was usedfor feature selection and the model was constructed by multivariate logistic regression.The diagnostic performance of the model was assessed by AUC. Calibration curvesand Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to evaluate the degree of overestimation orunderestimation of the model. DCA were used to measure the net clinical benefits.The LASSO algorithm was performed by \u201cglmmet\u201d package. The logistic regressionmodel was constructed by \u201cglm\u201d package. All statistical analyses were completedusing R 3.5.0 version.A total of 620 samples were included in the derivation cohort, among which 431samples (211 COVID-19 vs. 220 Control) were in the training set and 189 samples(91 COVID-19 vs. 98 Control) were in testing set by simple randomization. Thefrequency of COVID-19 in the training set (48.96%) was not significantly different111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131from that in the testing set (48.14%). We included 145 samples in the independentvalidation cohort.representative variables (age, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time, Red Blood CellDistribution Width-SD, Uric Acid, Triglyceride, Serum Potassium, Albumin/globulin,3-Hydroxybutyrate, Serum Calcium) with good identification value were selected andconstructed an optimized diagnostic model(see Figure 1). According to the suggestiveinformation from the model, among 145 samples that used for validation, 80 sampleswere estimated as COVID-19 and 65 samples were considered COVID-19-free.Compared with the status determined by nucleic acid detection (the golden standard),we found 69 real COVID-19 samples were correctly identified by the app (69/80,positive predictive value =86.25%), while 55, out of the 65 COVID-19-free samples,were confirmed to be negative (55/65, negative predictive value =84.62%). The areaunder curve (AUC) of the model were 0.890 and 0.872 in the testing set andindependent validation cohort, respectively(see Figure 2)(8). The calibration curveperformed well and Hosmer-Lemeshow test results P value was much greater than0.05(see Figure 3). The DCA quantitatively demonstrated high clinical net benefitover the entire probability threshold(see Figure 4)(9).The model was encapsulated as an APP, COVID-19 Diagnosis Aid APP. The risk ofCOVID-19 can be obtained by inputting the required indicators into the APP. It will133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153be online in the android store and IOS APP Store soon for facilitating the furtherapplication(see Figure 5).Organization(WHO), SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide with an intensifyingsituation, and many countries including South Korea, Italy, and the United States haveexperienced outbreaks(10). Timely diagnosis, isolation and treatment are critical tocontrol the global spread of COVID-19. However, nucleic acid testing is not alwaysfeasible or fully affordable in all regions. We therefore need more ways to realize theearly and accurate community control and screening of suspicious people. To ourknowledge, this is the first COVID-19 Diagnosis Aid APP based on laboratory testsfor extensive screening. It has good accuracy and stability, which can help medicalinstitutions to predict patients\u2019 situation in advance and accurately invest the limitedhealthcare resources, so as to effectively control the spread of the epidemic.Based on the optimized diagnostic model developed in current study, users can obtainthe probability of COVID-19 according to the simple, easily available and reliableindicators fromlaboratory examinations.Given satisfiablemodel predictionperformance (i.e., AUC was 0.872; positive predictive value and negative predictivevalue was reach 86.25% and 84.62%, respectively in independent validation cohort),the application of this app can provide reliable suggestion for further assessment ofthe index person, which has potential to reduce anxiety of public, as well asunnecessary hospital visit and nucleic acid testing.155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174175It is undeniable that nucleic acid detection is one of the most reliable standards for thediagnosis of COVID-19, but we should also be aware of its shortcomings anddeficiencies in practice. Nucleic acid testing requires professional technical platformsand physicians, and false negative results due to multiple reasons cannot becompletely avoided(11). Instead, laboratory indicators that identified in our study areaccessible, and can be widely used in community hospitals by family doctors tocomplete the early stage of suspected population screening.On the other hand, based on the technological revolution brought by the Internet, thisAPP software installed on personal mobile can not only help to discover COVID-19in the most convenient way, but also timely monitor dynamic trends of the prevalenceof the contagious disease through data transmission to the Disease Control Center orprofessional medical institution(12, 13). This provides real-time data with predictivevalue, which can be reliable basis for more accurate health and epidemic preventionpolicies. Furthermore, this APP software is continuously upgradeable, with thepossibility of extended scope of application. For example, we have added thedata acquisition function which enabled the documentation of epidemiological andclinical features and a personalized reminder for necessary revisits. Also, with futherimplementation of communication function, it is possible to establish a directpre-connection between individuals and medical centers, which may benefit patientsby avoiding unnecessary hospital visits or shorten waiting time spend beforeadmission (14).177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196197COVID-19 Diagnosis Aid APP can efficiently and accurately calculate the infectionprobability through simple and easily-obtained laboratory examination results. It willpromote the screening of a large number of suspected people, save limited medicalresources, optimize the diagnosis process, and it can constantly learn, adapt andupgrade, which are vital to control the global spread of COVID-19.The protocol of this study was approved by the West China Hospital, SichuanUniversity Medical Ethics Committee and conformed to the principles of theChiCTR2000030542The datasets used and analysed during the current study are available from thecorresponding author on reasonable request.This study was supported by Science and Technology Department of SichuanProvince \u201c2020YFS0004\u201d and Science and Technology Project of West China199200201202203204205206207208209210211212213214215216217218219Zirui Meng analyzed the data and was a major contributor in writing the manuscript.Minjin Wang designed the APP framework and was a major contributor in writing themanuscript.
