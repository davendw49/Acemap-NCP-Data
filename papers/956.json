Much has been learnt in the course of preceding epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and H1N1 influenza, and it is now recognized that their overall health burden may be underestimated since extra-pulmonary manifestations are frequent.1 Acute and chronic cardiovascular complications of pneumonia are common and result from various mechanisms, including relative ischaemia, systemic inflammation, and pathogen-mediated damage. There is, however, only limited published data concerning cardiovascular presentations in the wake of viral epidemics. The present COVID-19 outbreak emphasizes the need for greater awareness of the immediate and long-term cardiovascular implications of viral infection and the significant gaps in knowledge that future research will need to address.", "text": ".. laboratory-confirmed deaths and more than 200 000 deaths fromre.... spiratory disease worldwide (based upon epidemiological... modelling).3...

(A) The globaldistribution of COVID-19 on 16 March 2020 (figure source: COVID-19 situation reports from World Health Organization). (B) Direct and indirectcardiovascular consequences of respiratory virus infection.Early COVID-19 case reports suggest that patients with underlyingconditions are at higher risk for complications or mortality\u2014up to50% of hospitalized patients have a chronic medical illness (40%cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease). In the largest publishedclinical cohort of COVID-19 to date, acute cardiac injury, shock, andarrhythmia were present in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients,respectively,10 with higher prevalence amongst patients requiringintensive care.Viral pathology and links to thecardiovascular systemChronic cardiovascular disease may become unstable in the settingof viral infection as a consequence of imbalance betweeninfectioninduced increase in metabolic demand and reduced cardiac reserve.Patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure may be atparticular risk as a result of coronary plaque rupture secondary to virallyinduced systemic inflammation, and rigorous use of plaque stabilizing... agents (aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-convertingen.......... tzehygemy.leiPkerinolihh-icobooitaodgruosl)fasnhtteasnetfbfteehcertnosmsoubfgosgyseissstteaemnddiacassinsaeflpsasommsmseibnaltteiootnfhp1e3laramtepaleeyuttifinuccnsrctetraiaostne... and intensified anti-platelet therapy should be considered in those... with a history of previous coronary intervention....

The clinical effectsof pneumonia have been linked to increased risk of cardiovasculardisease up to 10-year follow-up16 and it is likely that cases infectedvia respiratory virus outbreaks will experience similar adverseoutcomes. Therapeutic use of corticosteroids further augments thepossibility of adverse cardiovascular events. However, long-termfollowup data concerning the survivors of respiratory virus epidemics arescarce. Lipid metabolism remained disrupted 12 years after clinicalrecovery in a metabolomic study amongst 25 SARS survivors,17whereas cardiac abnormalities observed during hospitalisation in eightpatients with H7N9 influenza returned to normal at 1-yearfollowup.18 Whilst viral phenotype, baseline clinical characteristics, initialdisease severity, and immediate management impact on short-termsurvival, long-term prognosis following outbreaks of respiratory virusinfection may equally depend upon the extra-pulmonarymanifestations. Serial follow-up studies amongst the survivors of acuteinfection are sorely needed.ConclusionsIncreased human mobility and ready access to international travelhave accelerated the rate of microbial transmission around the worldand global pandemics are a persistent threat. Outbreaks of viralrespiratory illness threaten public health but the associatedextrapulmonary manifestations and their prolonged consequences arefrequently overlooked. COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving epidemic withuncertain clinical characteristics and further acceleration seemslikely.19 Pre-existing cardiovascular disease may contribute to adverseearly clinical outcomes and infection may have longer-termimplications for overall cardiovascular health (Take home figure).Interdisciplinary management of severe cases (with priority for those withpre-existing cardiovascular disease) and prolonged clinical follow-upare therefore essential.Conflict of interest: none declared.", "ref_list": [[], ["The hidden burden of influenza: a review of the extra-pulmonary complications of influenza infection"], ["From SARS to MERS, thrusting coronaviruses into the spotlight"], ["Estimated global mortality associated with the first 12 months of 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus circulation: a modelling study"], ["Seasonal influenza infections and cardiovascular disease mortality"], ["Cardiovascular complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome"], ["Cardiac arrest in severe acute respiratory syndrome: analysis of 15 cases]"], ["ventricular performance in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a 30-day echocardiographic follow-up study"], ["Acute myocarditis associated with novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"], ["Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China"], ["Clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in Wuhan, China"], ["Prevalence of comorbidities in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): a systematic review and meta-analysis"], ["Frequency of troponin elevations in patients with influenza infection during the 2017-2018 influenza season"], ["Inflammation and thrombosis: the clot thickens"], ["SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses"], ["SARScoronavirus modulation of myocardial ACE2 expression and inflammation in patients with SARS"], ["Association between hospitalization for pneumonia and subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease"], ["Altered lipid metabolism in recovered SARS patients twelve years after infection"], ["Cardiac complications associated with the influenza viruses A subtype H7N9 or pandemic H1N1 in critically ill patients under intensive care"], ["Cardiac implications of coronavirus (COVID-19)"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], ["SA Sellers", "RS Hagan", "FG Hayden", "Fischer WA"], ["Z Song", "Y Xu", "L Bao", "L Zhang", "P Yu", "Y Qu", "H Zhu", "W Zhao", "Y Han", "C Qin"], ["FS Dawood", "AD Iuliano", "C Reed", "MI Meltzer", "DK Shay", "D Bandaranayake", "RF Breiman", "WA Brooks", "P Buchy", "DR Feikin", "KB Fowler", "A Gordon", "NT Hien", "P Horby", "QS Huang", "MA Katz", "A Krishnan", "R Lal", "JM Montgomery", "K M\u00f8lbak", "R Pebody", "AM Presanis", "H Razuri", "A Steens", "YO Tinoco", "J Wallinga", "H Yu", "S Vong", "J Bresee", "M-A Widdowson"], ["JL Nguyen", "W Yang", "K Ito", "TD Matte", "J Shaman", "PL Kinney"], ["Yu C-M."], ["S Pan", "H Zhang", "C Li", "C.
