Three coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier to cause deadlypneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century: severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)                MERS-CoV was suggested to originate from bats but the reservoir host fuelingspillover to humans is unequivocally dromedary camels (Haagmans et al., 2014;Memish et al., 2013). Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related to eachother and originated in bats which most likely serve as reservoir host for these twoviruses                Coronavirus entry into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S)glycoprotein that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface (Tortorici andVeesler, 2019). S comprises two functional subunits responsible for binding to the hostcell receptor (S1 subunit) and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (S2 subunit).For many CoVs, S is cleaved at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits whichremain non-covalently bound in the prefusion conformation                Different coronaviruses use distinct domains within the S1 subunit to recognize avariety of attachment and entry receptors, depending on the viral species. Endemichuman coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 attach via their S domain A (SA) to5-N-acetyl-9O-acetyl-sialosides found on glycoproteins and glycolipids at the host cell surface toenable entry into susceptible cells (Hulswit et al., 2019; Tortorici et al., 2019; Vlasak etal., 1988). MERS-CoV S, however, uses domain A to engage non-acetylated sialosidesas attachment receptors (Li et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019) and promote subsequentbinding of domain B (SB) to the entry receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (Lu et al., 2013;Raj et al., 2013). SARS-CoV and several SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV)interact directly with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via SB to enter targetcells                As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is surface-exposed and mediates entry intohost cells, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) upon infection and thefocus of therapeutic and vaccine design. S trimers are extensively decorated withNlinked glycans that are important for proper folding (Rossen et al., 1998) and tomodulate accessibility to host proteases and neutralizing antibodies (Walls et al., 2016b;Walls et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015b). We previously characterizedpotent human neutralizing Abs from rare memory B cells of individuals infected withSARS-CoV (Traggiai et al., 2004) or MERS-CoV        We report here that ACE2 could mediate SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry intocells, establishing it as a functional receptor for this newly emerged coronavirus. TheSARS-CoV-2 SB engages human ACE2 (hACE2) with comparable affinity thanSARSCoV SB from viral isolates associated with the 2002-2003 epidemic (i.e. binding withhigh affinity to hACE2). Tight binding to hACE2 could explain the efficient transmissionof SARS-CoV-2 in humans, as was the case for SARS-CoV. We identified the presenceof an unexpected furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 S, which iscleaved during biosynthesis, a novel feature setting this virus apart from SARS-CoV andSARSr-CoVs. Abrogation of this cleavage motif moderately affected SARS-CoV-2Smediated entry into VeroE6 or BHK cells but may contribute to expand the tropism ofthis virus, as reported for several highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses andpathogenic Newcastle disease virus (Klenk and Garten, 1994; Steinhauer, 1999). Wedetermined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomaintrimer and reveal that it adopts multiple SB conformations that are reminiscent ofprevious reports on both SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S. Finally, we show thatSARSCoV S mouse polyclonal sera potently inhibited entry into target cells of SARS-CoV-2 Spseudotyped viruses. Collectively, these results pave the way for designing vaccineseliciting broad protection against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV.        The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein shares ~80% amino acid sequence identity withthe SARS-CoV S Urbani and with bat SARSr-CoV ZXC21 S and ZC45 S glycoprotein.The latter two SARSr-CoV sequences were identified from Rinolophus sinicus (Chinesehorseshoe bats), the species from which SARSr-CoV WIV-1 and WIV-16 were isolated                We set out to investigate the functional determinants of S-mediated entry intotarget cells using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudotyping system (Millet andWhittaker, 2016). To assess the ability of SARS-CoV-2 S to promote entry into targetcells, we first compared transduction of SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV and SARS-CoV S-MLVinto VeroE6 cells, that are known to express ACE2 and support SARS-CoV replication        Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S reveals the presence of a four amino acidresidue insertion at the boundary between the S1 and S2 subunits compared toSARSCoV S and SARSr-CoV S (Fig. 1 C). This results in the introduction of a furin cleavagesite, a feature conserved among the 103 SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced to date butnot in the closely related RaTG13 S (Zhou et al., 2020). Using Western blot analysis, weobserved that SARS-CoV-2 S was virtually entirely processed at the S1/S2 site duringbiosynthesis in HEK293T cells, presumably by furin in the Golgi compartment (Fig. 1D). This observation contrasts with SARS-CoV S which was incorporated intopseudovirions largely uncleaved (Fig. 1 D). To study the influence on pseudovirus entryof the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 furin cleavage site, we designed an S mutant lacking the fouramino acid residue insertion and the furin cleavage site by mutatingQ686TNSPRRAR\u2193SV696 (wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S) to Q686TILR\u2193SV692 (SARS-CoV-2Sfur/mut). SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut preserves only the conserved Arg residue at position 994of wildtype SARS-CoV-2 S thereby mimicking the S1/S2 cleavage site of the relatedSARSr-CoV S CZX21 (Fig. 1 D). SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut is therefore expected to undergoprocessing at the S1/S2 site upon encounter of a target cell, similarly to SARS-CoV Sand SARSr-CoV S (i.e. via TMPRSS2 and/or cathepsin L). As expected, SARS-CoV-2Sfur/mut-MLV harbored uncleaved S upon budding (Fig. 1 D). The observed transductionefficiency of VeroE6 cells was higher for SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut-MLV than forSARS-CoV2 S-MLV Fig. 1 A) whereas the opposite trend was observed for transduction ofhACE2expressing BHK cells (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that S1/S2 cleavage during Sbiosynthesis was not necessary for S-mediated entry in the conditions of ourexperiments (Fig. 1 C-D). We speculate that the detection of a polybasic cleavage sitein the fusion glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 could putatively expand its tropism and/orenhance its transmissibility, compared to SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV isolates, due tothe near-ubiquitous distribution of furin-like proteases and their reported effects on otherviruses (Klenk and Garten, 1994; Millet and Whittaker, 2015; Steinhauer, 1999) .SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human ACE2 with comparable affinity than SARS-CoV        The binding affinity of SARS-CoV for hACE2 correlate with the overall rate ofviral replication in distinct species, transmissibility and disease severity (Guan et al.,2003; Li et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005c; Wan et al., 2020). Indeed, specific SB mutationsenabled efficient binding to hACE2 of SARS-CoV isolates from the three phases of the2002-2003 epidemic, which were associated with marked disease severity                To understand the contribution of receptor interaction to the infectivity ofSARSCoV-2, we characterized engagement of hACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SBside-by-side. We used biolayer interferometry to study binding kinetics and affinity of thepurified hACE2 ectodomain to SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB immobilized at thesurface of biosensors. We found that hACE2 bound to SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoVSB with respective equilibrium dissociation constants of 2.9 nM (Fig. 2 A) and 7.7 nM(Fig. 2 B), and comparable kinetic rate constants although the off-rate was slightlyhigher for SARS-CoV SB (Table 1). Previous structural work identified 14 positions thatare key for binding of SARS-CoV SB to hACE2: T402, R426, Y436, Y440, Y442, L472,N473, Y475, N479, Y484, T486, T487, G488 and Y491 (Li et al., 2005a). Analysis ofthe 104 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available from GISAID        To enable single-particle cryoEM study of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, wedesigned a prefusion stabilized ectodomain trimer construct with an abrogated furinS1/S2 cleavage site (Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2017a; Walls et al., 2016a; Wallset al., 2019), two consecutive proline stabilizing mutations (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018;Pallesen et al., 2017) and a C-terminal foldon trimerization domain (Miroshnikov et al.,1998). 3D classification of the cryoEM data revealed the presence of multipleconformational states of SARS-CoV-2 S corresponding to distinct organization of the SBdomains within the S1 apex. Approximately half of the particle images selectedcorrespond to trimers harboring a single SB domain opened whereas the remaining halfwas accounted for by closed trimers with the 3 SB domains closed. The observedconformational variability of SB domains is reminiscent of observations made withSARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S trimers although we did not detect trimers with two SBdomains open and the distribution of particles across the S conformational landscapevaries among studies (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017;Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017).We determined a reconstruction of the closed SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimerat 3.3 \u00c5 resolution (applying 3-fold symmetry) and an asymmetric reconstruction of thetrimer with a single SB domain opened at 3.7 \u00c5 resolution (Fig 3 A-H, Fig S2, Table 2).The S2 fusion machinery is the best resolved part of the map whereas the SA and SBdomains are less well resolved, presumably due to conformational heterogeneity. Thefinal atomic model comprises residues 36-1157, with internal breaks corresponding toflexible regions, and lacks the C-terminal most segment (including the heptad repeat 2)which is not visible in the map, as is the case for all S structures determined to date.Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain is a 160\u00c5-long trimer with a triangularcrosssection, resembling the closely related SARS-CoV S structure (Fig S3 A-F) (Gui et al.,2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017).As is the case for other \u03b2-coronavirus S glycoproteins, including SARS-CoV S(Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019; Songet al., 2018; Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2016a; Walls et al., 2016b; Walls et al.,2019; Yuan et al., 2017), the S1 subunit has a V-shaped architecture (Fig S3 B-E). Inthe closed S trimer, the three hACE2-recognition motifs, whose location was inferredbased on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV SB in complex with hACE2 (Li et al.,2005a), are buried at the interface between protomers. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 SBopening is expected to be necessary for interacting with ACE2 at the host cell surfaceand initiating the conformational changes leading to cleavage of the S2\u2019 site, membranefusion and viral entry (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Millet and Whittaker,2014; Pallesen et al., 2017; Park et al., 2016; Song et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2019; Yuanet al., 2017).As the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S2 subunits share 88% sequence identity,they are structurally conserved and can be superimposed with 1.2 \u00c5 rmsd over 417aligned C\u03b1 positions (Fig S3 E-F). Only the most N-terminal part of the fusion peptide isresolved in the map, as was the case for previously determined SARS-CoV Sstructures. The sequence and conformational conservation of the fusion peptide regionobserved across SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S suggests that antibodies targetingthis functionally important motif might cross-react and neutralize the two viruses as wellas related coronaviruses (Fig S3 G-H)We previously showed that coronavirus S glycoproteins are densely decoratedby heterogeneous N-linked glycans protruding from the trimer surface (Walls et al.,2016b; Walls et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2017). These oligosaccharides participate in Sfolding (Rossen et al., 1998), they affect priming by host proteases (Yang et al., 2015b)and modulate antibody recognition (Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls et al., 2019).SARSCoV-2 S comprise 22 N-linked glycosylation sequons per protomer and 16 of them areresolved in the cryoEM map (Fig. 4). By comparison, SARS-CoV S possesses 23Nlinked glycosylation sequons per protomer and we previously confirmed experimentallythat at least 19 of them are glycosylated (Walls et al., 2019). 20 out of 22 SARS-CoV-2S N-linked glycosylation sequons are conserved in SARS-CoV S (Table 3). Specifically,9 out of 13 glycans in the S1 subunit and all 9 glycans in the S2 subunit are conservedamong SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S. Furthermore, S2 oligosaccharides are mostlyconserved across SARSr-CoV S glycoproteins, suggesting that accessibility of thefusion machinery to antibodies will be comparable among these viruses.SARS-CoV S elicits neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S        Mapping of the sequence conservation across multiple sarbecovirus Ssequences underscores that the S2 fusion machinery is more conserved than the S1subunit with the highest divergence found within SA and SB (Fig. 5A-B). Theseobservations are in line with (i) the fact that some, but not all of these viruses use ACE2as entry receptor        Based on these observations, we hypothesized that exposure to one of the twoviruses could elicit cross-reactive and potentially neutralizing antibodies against theother virus. We therefore investigated the ability of plasma from four mice immunizedwith a stabilized SARS-CoV S to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S- and SARS-CoV S-mediatedentry into target cells. All sera tested completely inhibited transduction of SARS-CoVSMLV and reduced SARS-CoV-2 S-MLV transduction to ~10% of control in VeroE6 cells(Fig. 5C). The elicitation of a heterotypic response blocking SARS-CoV-2 S-mediatedentry into host cells concurs with the sequence and structural conservation ofSARSCoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S along with their comparable glycans shields, and suggeststhat immunity against one virus of the sarbecovirus subgenus can potentially provideprotection against related viruses.entry into host cells. A-B. Sequence conservation of sarbecovirus S glycoproteinsplotted on the SARS-CoV-2 S structure. C. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Spseudotyped viruses is potently inhibited by four SARS-CoV S mouse polyclonalimmune plasma.        Receptor recognition is the first step of viral infection and is a key determinant ofhost cell and tissue tropism. Enhanced binding affinity between SARS-CoV S andhACE2 was proposed to correlate with increased virus transmissibility and diseaseseverity in humans (Li et al., 2005c). Indeed, SARS-CoV isolates from the three phasesof the 2002-2003 epidemic were more efficiently transmitted among humans and morepathogenic than the isolates associated with the 2003-2004 re-emergence that causedonly a few cases, in line with their binding affinities for hACE2                Besides binding to host cell receptors, priming of the S glycoprotein by hostproteases through cleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2\u2019 sites is another crucial factormodulating tropism and pathogenicity (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). For instance, entryof the MERS-CoV-related bat coronavirus HKU4 into human cells required addition ofexogenous trypsin, indicating that S proteolytic activation of this bat virus did not occurin human cells (despite its ability to recognize human DPP4)(Wang et al., 2014; Yang etal., 2014). Subsequent work suggested that a glycan present near the S1/S2 boundaryaccounted for the lack of proteolytic priming of HKU4 S and that its removal enhancedpseudovirus entry in human cells (Yang et al., 2015b). The presence of a polybasiccleavage site, that can be processed by furin-like proteases, is a signature of severalhighly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and pathogenic Newcastle disease virus(Klenk and Garten, 1994; Steinhauer, 1999). Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 S harbors a furincleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary, which is processed during biosynthesis. Thepresence of a furin cleavage site sets SARS-CoV-2 S apart from SARS-CoV S (andSARSr-CoV S) that possesses a monobasic S1/S2 cleavage site processed upon entryof target cells        We previously suggested coronaviruses use conformational masking and glycanshielding to limit recognition by the immune response of infected hosts (Walls et al.,2016b; Walls et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2017). Similarly to SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoVS (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018;Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017), we found that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer exist inmultiple, distinct conformational states resulting from SB opening at the trimer apex.These structural changes are necessary for receptor engagement of these three virusesand lead to initiation of fusogenic conformational changes (Song et al., 2018; Walls etal., 2017b; Walls et al., 2019). In contrast, only closed S trimers have been detected forHCoV-NL63 (Walls et al., 2016b), HCoV-OC43 (Tortorici et al., 2019), HCoV-HKU1(Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) and HCoV-229E (Li et al., 2019). As HCoV-NL63 andHCoV229E are known to engage protein receptors through SB (Wong et al., 2017; Wu et al.,2009), trimer opening is also expected to occur to expose their receptor-recognitionmotifs that are otherwise buried at the interface between protomers in the closed Strimer (Li et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2016b). Regardless of the nature of the receptor andof the location of the receptor-binding domains, removal of the trimeric S1 crown isexpected to be necessary for all coronaviruses to allow the large-scale S2conformational changes leading to fusion of the viral and host membranes (Walls et al.,2017b). Collectively, these data underscores that S glycoprotein trimers found in highlypathogenic human coronaviruses appear to exist in partially opened states whereasthey remain largely closed in human coronaviruses associated with common colds.Based on the aforementioned data correlating the binding affinity of SARS-CoV forhACE2 with the rate of transmissibility, viral replication in distinct species and diseaseseverity (Guan et al., 2003; Li et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005c; Wan et al., 2020), wehypothesize that the most pathogenic coronaviruses will exhibit S glycoprotein trimersspontaneously sampling closed and open conformations, as is the case forSARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.The striking structural similarity and sequence conservation among theSARSCoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S glycoproteins emphasize the close relationship betweenthese two viruses that recognize hACE2 to enter target cells. This resemblance isfurther strengthened by our finding that SARS-CoV S elicited polyclonal Ab responsespotently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into cells. We surmise most ofthese Abs target the highly conserved S2 subunit (including the fusion peptide region)based on its structural similarity across SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and previousreports showing that sera from SARS-CoV-infected individuals target this region (Zhanget al., 2004). We note that most SARS-CoV neutralizing Abs isolated to date target theSB domain and several of them recognize the RBM and prevent receptor engagement(Hwang et al., 2006; Rockx et al., 2008; Rockx et al., 2010; Traggiai et al., 2004; Wallset al., 2019). As the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV SB domains share 75% amino acidsequence identity, future work will be necessary to evaluate how many of theseantibodies neutralize the newly emerged coronavirus. These findings also indicate thatit might be difficult to distinguish exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from other SARSr-CoVs inserological studies using S ectodomain trimers and that specific assays will need to bedesigned. Our results provide a structural framework to identify conserved andaccessible epitopes across S glycoproteins that will support ongoing vaccine designefforts. Finally, elicitation of diverse, polyclonal Ab responses might prove key in light ofthe diversity of viruses circulating in animal reservoirs and to prevent the possibleemergence of viral neutralization escape mutants.This study was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences(R01GM120553, D.V.), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(HHSN272201700059C, DV), a Pew Biomedical Scholars Award (D.V.), anInvestigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award from the BurroughsWellcome Fund (D.V.), the Open Philantropic Foundation (D.V.) and the PasteurInstitute (M.A.T.).

The purified protein wasquantified using absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml.MLV-based SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV-2 Sfur/mut pseudotypes wereprepared as previously described (Millet and Whittaker, 2016). HEK293T cells werecotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) with an S encoding-plasmid,an MLV Gag-Pol packaging construct and the MLV transfer vector encoding a luciferasereporter, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were incubated for 5 hoursat 37\u02daC with transfection medium. Cells were then washed with DMEM 2X and DMEMcontaining 10% FBS was added for 60 hours. The supernatants were then harvestedand filtered through 0.45-mm membranes and concentrated with a 30kDa membrane for10 minutes at 3,000 rpm and then frozen at -80\u02daC.SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV-2 SFur/Mut pseudovirions were thawedand 4X SDS loading buffer was added prior to boiling for 10 min at 95\u02daC. Samples wererun on a 4%\u201320% gradient Tris-Glycine Gel (BioRad) and transferred to a PVDFmembrane. An anti-S2 SARS-CoV S monoclonal primary antibody (1:150 dilution) or anMLV p30 monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution, AbCam) and an Alexa Fluor680conjugated goat anti-human or mouse secondary antibody (1:30,000 and 1:15,000dilution respectively, Jackson Laboratory) were used for Western-blotting. A LI-CORprocessor was used to develop images.VeroE6 and Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in 10% FBS, 1% PenStrepDMEM. BHK or VeroE6 cells were plated into 12 well plates at a density of 0.3 x 106 for16 hours. BHK cells were either not transfected or transfected with 0.8 \u00b5g ACE2 perwell using standard lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies) protocols and incubated foranother 16 hours. Concentrated pseudovirus was added to the wells after washing 3Xwith DMEM. After 2-3 hours 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep containing DMEM was addedto the cells for 48 hours. Following the 48 hr infection, One-Glo-EX (Promega) wasadded to the cells in equivalent culturing volume and incubated in the dark for 10minutes prior to reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader (ThermoFisher).Measurements were done in triplicate and relative luciferase units (RLU) were plotted.Assays were performed on an Octet Red (ForteBio) instrument at 30\u02daC with shaking at1,000 RPM. Anti-penta His biosensors were hydrated in water for 30 minutes prior to a1 min incubation in 10X kinetics buffer (undiluted). Either SARS-CoV-2 SB or SARS-CoVSB were loaded at 10-20 \u00b5g/mL in 10X Kinetics Buffer for 200-900 seconds prior tobaseline equilibration for 180 seconds in 10X kinetics buffer. Association in 10X kineticsbuffer diluted ACE2 at various concentrations in a two-fold dilution series from 20nM to2.5nM was carried out for 1,000 seconds prior to dissociation at 10X kinetics buffer for1,000 seconds. The data were baseline subtracted prior to fitting performed using a 1:1binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. Mean kon, koff values weredetermined with a global fit applied to all data. The experiments were done with twoseparate purification batches of SARS-CoV SB, SARS-CoV-2-SB, and ACE2 in triplicateand the average is reported.The SARS-CoV-2 2P S and SARS-CoV 2P S ectodomains were produced in 500mLHEK293F cells grown in suspension using FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Lifetechnologies) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 r.p.m. Thecultures were transfected using 293fectin (ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to adensity of 1 million cells per mL and cultivated for three days. The supernatants wereharvested and cells resuspended for another three days, yielding two harvests. Clarifiedsupernatants were purified using a 5mL Cobalt affinity column (Takara). Purified proteinwas filtered or concentrated and flash frozen in Tris-saline (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mMNaCl) prior to negative staining and cryo-EM analysis.3 \u00b5L of 0.16 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S was loaded onto a freshly glow discharged (30 s at20 mA) lacey carbon grid with a thin layer of evaporated continuous carbon prior toplunge freezing using a vitrobot MarkIV (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a blot force of -1and 2.5 second blot time at 100% humidity and 25\u00b0C. Data were acquired using theLeginon software (Suloway et al., 2005) to control an FEI Titan Krios transmissionelectron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit directdetector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode with a slitwidth of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon at a nominalmagnification of 130,000x with a pixel size of 0.525 \u00c5. The dose rate was adjusted to 8counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in super-resolution mode fractionated in50 frames of 200 ms. 3,000 micrographs were collected in a single session with adefocus range comprised between 1.0 and 2.5 \u03bcm.Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer functionparameters, particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp (Tegunov andCramer, 2019). Particle images were extracted with a box size of 800 binned to 400yielding a pixel size of 1.05 \u00c5. For each data set two rounds of reference-free 2Dclassification were performed using cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017) to selectwelldefined particle images. Subsequently, two rounds of 3D classification with 50 iterationseach (angular sampling 7.5\u02da for 25 iterations and 1.8\u02da with local search for 25 iterations)were carried out using Relion (Zivanov et al., 2018) without imposing symmetry toseparate distinct SARS-CoV-2 S conformations. 3D refinements were carried out usingnon-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017) using an ab initio modelgenerated using cryoSPARC. Particle images were subjected to Bayesian polishing(Zivanov et al., 2019) before performing another round of on-uniform refinement incryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017) followed by per-particle defocus refinement and againnon-uniform refinement. Local resolution estimation, filtering and sharpening wascarried out using CryoSPARC. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standardFourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143 criterion and Fourier shell correlation curveswere corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution(Scheres and Chen, 2012).        UCSF Chimera (Goddard et al., 2007) and Coot were used to fit atomic models (PDB6NB6) into the cryoEM map. The model was subsequently manually rebuilt using Cootand the C3-symmetrized map        57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and maintained at theComparative Medicine Facility at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Aftercollecting a pre-bleed, mice were immunized with 5\u00b5g of SARS-CoV 2P S ectodomaintrimer formulated in 50\u00b5l of PBS and 50\u00b5l of Sigma Adjuvant System subcutaneously inthe base of the tail at weeks 0, 4, and 12 and bleeds were collected 2 weeks after eachimmunization. Plasma from immunized animals was heat inactivated at 56\u00baC for 1 hourand then stored at 4\u00baC until use. All experiments were conducted at the FredHutchinson Cancer Research Center according to approved Institutional Animal Careand Use Committee protocols.Frenz, B.D.R., S.; Borst A.J.; Walls, A.C.; Adolf-Bryfogle, J.; Schief, W.R.; Veesler, D.; DiMaio, F.(2019).

Briefly, hACE2 was produced in 500mL HEK293F cells grown insuspension using FreeStyle 293 expression medium (Life technologies) at 37\u02daC in ahumidified 8% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 rpm. The supernatants were harvested and cellsresuspended for another four days, yielding two harvests. The purified protein wasquantified using absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 1 mg/ml. HEK293T cells werecotransfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) with an S encoding-plasmid,an MLV Gag-Pol packaging construct and the MLV transfer vector encoding a luciferasereporter, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were then washed with DMEM 2X and DMEMcontaining 10% FBS was added for 60 hours. The supernatants were then harvestedand filtered through 0.45-mm membranes and concentrated with a 30kDa membrane for10 minutes at 3,000 rpm and then frozen at -80\u02daC.SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV-2 SFur/Mut pseudovirions were thawedand 4X SDS loading buffer was added prior to boiling for 10 min at 95\u02daC. Samples wererun on a 4%\u201320% gradient Tris-Glycine Gel (BioRad) and transferred to a PVDFmembrane. After 2-3 hours 20% FBS and 2% PenStrep containing DMEM was addedto the cells for 48 hours. Assays were performed on an Octet Red (ForteBio) instrument at 30\u02daC with shaking at1,000 RPM. Mean kon, koff values weredetermined with a global fit applied to all data. Clarifiedsupernatants were purified using a 5mL Cobalt affinity column (Takara). 3,000 micrographs were collected in a single session with adefocus range comprised between 1.0 and 2.5 \u03bcm. Subsequently, two rounds of 3D classification with 50 iterationseach (angular sampling 7.5\u02da for 25 iterations and 1.8\u02da with local search for 25 iterations)were carried out using Relion (Zivanov et al., 2017) followed by per-particle defocus refinement and againnon-uniform refinement. Local resolution estimation, filtering and sharpening wascarried out using CryoSPARC.
