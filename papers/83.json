It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral", "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-stranded enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the Nidovirales order,and are classified into four genera: a, b, d and g. Two of the b-CoVs, the server acute respiratorysyndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), havecaused serious epidemic-like outbreaks. In 2002, SARS emerged in southern China and was spreadingin 2003 around the world resulting in ~8,000 cases with a fatality rate of about 10%(WHO, 2004). Tenyears later, MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia and spread to different countries with a fatality rate ofabout 35%(WHO, 2016). Both viruses are of zoonotic nature: SARS-CoV originates from bats/civetcats(Ge et al., 2013), and dromedary camels are the major reservoir host of MERS(Reusken et al.,2016). Nevertheless, both viruses are known to transmit from human to human(de Wit et al., 2016). Afew other CoVs of zoonotic origin are circulating endemic in the human population, which cause mildinfections of the respiratory tract, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1(Gaunt et al., 2010).In December, 2019, a novel CoV (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan in China, and spreadrapidly from this area to the globe(Holshue et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Although its original hostremains unknown, all available data point again to a zoonotic, a wild animal source. And, it is evidentthat a human-to-human transmission is causing the rapid spreading of this virus. Viral strains frominfected persons of the area have been sequenced arguing for a common ancestor as there was onlylittle genetic variation found(Rambaut, 2020). Full-length genome analysis of various 2019-nCoVpatient samples revealed a 79.5% and 96% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat SARSr-Cov(severe acute respiratory syndrome-related CoV), respectively; however, sequences of the sevenconserved viral replicase domains in ORF1ab show 94.6% identity between 2019-nCoV andSARSCoV(Zhou et al., 2020)It is widely accepted that the CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its trimerictransmembrane spike glycoprotein (S-protein) with the human receptors on the host cell surface. TheS-protein consists of two subunits (i.e., S1 and S2) and is essential for the early steps of host cellinfection: S-protein of a virion binds to the host cell receptors via its S1 receptor-binding domain(SRBD) and then fuses the viral membrane with cellular membranes. The host cell receptors differ amonghuman CoVs: SARS-CoV binds to exopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2)(Li et al.,2005; Li et al., 2003), and MERS-CoV to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)(Raj et al., 2013). Other CoVssuch as HCoV-HKU1 use O-acetylated sialic acid as a receptor (Huang et al., 2015).        Sequence alignment of S1-proteins has revealed a sequence identity of about 75% between that of2019-nCoV and those of several other CoVs including SARS-CoV        Here, we employ protein-protein docking approach to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoVSRBD with ACE2, based on the experimentally determined complex structure of SARS-CoV S-RBDcomplexed with ACE2(Li et al., 2005) and on the predicted structure of 2019-nCoV S-protein RBDaccording to gene sequence. Computational protein-protein docking with accurate, physics-basedenergy functions is able to reveal the native-like, low-energy protein-protein complex from theunbound structures of two individual, interacting protein components(Chaudhury et al., 2011), such asantibody-antigen interacting structures(Weitzner et al., 2017), and thereby to calculate the binding freeenergy of the investigated protein-protein interactions. To this end, large-scale local protein-proteindocking was first carried out to sample a large number of thermodynamically probable bindingconformations for the interaction of S-RBD with ACE2. Next, the binding free energy of RBD toACE2 was calculated according to the thermodynamic average of the sampled, low-energy bindingconformations. Our results show that the human-receptor binding affinity of 2019-nCoV is about 73%of that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is able to bind to ACE2, and thereby to cause humaninfections similar to that of SARS-CoV.To quantify the binding interactions of CoV S-protein with ACE2, we employed the well-establishedmethod of local protein-protein docking implemented in Rosetta software suite(Das and Baker, 2008).Using this approach, we sampled a large number of low-energy conformations of S-protein RBD incomplex with ACE2 by preforming multiple, independent docking runs (i.e., simulations). Physically,the sampled conformations are considered to be accessible in the real-world process of S-proteinbinding to ACE2, according to their thermodynamic probabilities. The latter are determined by theconformational energies with the physically realistic, all-atom energy function for macromolecularmodeling and design implemented in Rosetta(Alford et al., 2017).To validate the docking approach, we first carried out local protein-protein docking to investigatethe binding interactions of SARS-CoV S-RBD with ACE2, in order to test whether this approach couldidentify the lowest-energy conformation of S-protein RBD complexed with ACE2 identical or close tothe experimental structure(Li et al., 2005). The latter is considered to be the most probable, nativebinding conformation in reality. As described in Methods, similar to the studies of (Chaudhury et al.,2011), the co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV S-RBD in complex with ACE2 (PDB 2AJF) was used asthe starting complex for the local protein-protein docking. Then, more than 3,000 independent dockingruns were conducted to sample the low-energy binding conformations by optimizing rigid-bodyorientation and side-chain conformations, according to the docking protocols in Methods. The bindingfree-energy scores of the obtained complex models are shown in the scatter plot in Fig. 1A, againsttheir RMSD (root mean square deviation) values of interface residues with respect to those in thestarting crystal structure (PDB 2AJF).As seen, a deep energetic funnel exhibits in the plot, and therefore clearly indicates that the dockingsimulations are very successful, because the presence of such a funnel is the most robust measure ofsuccessful docking simulations(Chaudhury et al., 2011). Due to their locations at the funnel bottom,the top-scoring models have better binding free-energy scores than other low-energy models, andtherefore are considered to be the most probable, native-like binding conformations in thermodynamics.Significantly, the number of the native-like models among the top five scores (N5) is 5; also, theirinterface RMSDs are within 1.5 \u00c5. Therefore, the lowest-energy conformations identified by thedocking approach are almost identical to the experimental structure (PDB 2AJF). This provides a verysolid basis for using this approach to investigate the S-RBD-ACE2 interactions of 2019-nCoV, inwhich no experimental complex structure is available because of time limitation, but only thefirstdetermined genome data that can be used to predict the S-protein structure.The successful identification of the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy bindingconformations also validates the accuracy of the Rosetta all-atom energy function for quantifying theinteractions of S-protein RBD with ACE2. Therefore, we could use the average binding energy scoresof these conformations as an experiment-based energy reference to characterize the binding strengthof 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 and to deduce its binding strength relative to that of SARS-CoV.Obviously, such a comparison assessment avoids using the calculated, absolute free-energy scores tocorrelate with the binding strength, which might systematically differ from the actual measurementvalues because of the intrinsic, theoretical approximations of the used Rosetta all-atom energy function(Alford et al., 2017). We want to point out that the docking simulations for SARS-CoV and2019nCoV use the same protocols and a consistent all-atom energy function. So, even the calculated energyscores contain certain errors caused by theoretical approximations, determination of the relativebinding strength by comparing the calculated scores of two viruses should be very accurate.binding models. They are almost identical to the experimental structure with RMSDs < 1.5 \u00c5.Because the 2019-nCo genome has just been sequenced for a very short period, an experimental 3Dstructure for performing protein-protein docking of ACE2 to 2019-nCoV S-RBD is not yet available.Alternatively, computational methods might be used to predict the 3D structure(Schwede et al., 2009).Fortunately, the 2019-nCoV genome has shown that the amino-acid sequence of the S-protein is about75% identical to that of the SARS-CoV S-protein (Fig. 2A). Therefore, with the SARS-CoV S-RBDstructure as a template, it is possible to use high-resolution homology modeling method to accuratelypredict the 3D model(Qian et al., 2007).different from those of SARS-CoV S-RBD (see also Fig. 2A) are shown as sphere models.To the end, we first generated an initial model for the 2019-nCoV RBD via SWISS-MDOEL website, with the experimental S-RBD structure of SARS-CoV as the template (PDB 2AJF). Then, weperformed all-atom refinements to optimize this initial model with Rosetta protocols (see Methods).The top-1 scoring model was used as the 3D structure of the 2019-nCoV S-RBD for the protein-proteindocking with the experimental structure of ACE2 from PDB 2AJF. By superimposing this model ontothe SARS-CoV S-RBD structure (Fig. 2B), we obtained the starting configuration of S-RBDcomplexed with ACE2 for the 2019-nCoV docking (Fig. 2C). From this complex, we found that mostof the residues that are different from those of SARS-CoV S-RBD (see also Fig. 2A) are close to orlocated in the binding interface. As we will show, such a residue distribution could lead to a differentbinding affinity from that of SARS-CoV S-RBD binding to ACE2.With the complex model in Fig. 2C, more than 3,000 independent docking runs were performed toidentify thermodynamically probable, low-energy binding conformations. The results are illustrated inFig. 3. As shown in the scatter plot in Fig. 3A, the docking simulations also achieved an energeticfunnel, in which four models among the top-5 scores have interface RMSDs within 0.7 \u00c5. Thisdemonstrates that the docking has identified the native-like interacting conformations for the2019nCoV S-RBD binding to ACE2. We consider these lowest-energy conformations at the energeticfunnel bottom as those being engaged in the receptor-binding function.binding free-energy scores versus RMSDs of interface residues of the thermodynamically probable, low-energy bindingmodels, where the RMSD reference is the lowest-energy obtained in the first-phase docking simulations. (B) The fivetopscoring binding models.When comparing the SARS-CoV results in Fig. 1A, we found that there is no binding conformationwith a binding energy score which is lower than that of the lowest-energy conformation of SARS-CoVderived from experimentally determined structure (-37.4 kcal\u00b7mol-1 in Fig. 1A). To be sure, we alsocarried out high-resolution all-atom refinements to further optimize the lowest-energy bindingconformation by 200 independent runs (see Methods). As indicated the scatter plot in Fig. 4A, thelowest-energy value of the 200 refined models remains about -28.4 kcal\u00b7mol-1 (see model in Fig. 4B).Considering that the protein-proteindockinghas already sampled a large number ofthermodynamically probable, low-energy binding conformations, these results indicate that theexistence of an ACE2-binding conformation for 2019-nCoV with an energy value < -37.4 kcal\u00b7mol-1is very limited. So, the binding strength of 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 is likely lower than that ofSARS-CoV S-RBD.versus RMSDs of interface residues of the refined models, where the RMSD reference is the lowest-energy conformationin Fig. 3A. (B) The lowest-energy model of S-RBD binding to ACE2 with an energy score of -28.4 kcal\u00b7mol-1.The successful identifications of the native-like binding conformations of S-RBDs with ACE2 enablea comparison of the receptor-binding capability of 2019-nCoV with that of SARS-CoV. Especially,the obtained energy scores based on the experimentally determined structure of SARS-CoV defined abinding free-energy scale, on which the relative receptor-binding strength of a newly emerged CoVcould be evaluated.According to statistical thermodynamics, we considered that the sampled binding conformationsin the Monte Carlo docking simulations are thermodynamically probable in the binding process ofSprotein to ACE2 and, based on definition of binding free energy (i.e., binding affinity) is indeed athermodynamic average over all possible binding modes of two interacting components. Thus, thebinding free energy is approximated by the thermodynamic average of the binding energies of all thesampled low-energy conformations as:\u2329\u2206\u232a \u2248\u2211() \u2206'( *+,-.\u2211() *+,-.01\u2206/(2simulations, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature (i.e., 298.15 K for the roomtemperature). Note that, when N approaches the number of all thermodynamically probable(1)(2)(3)conformations, \u2329\u2206\u232a becomes the exact value.energy of SARS-CoV S-RBD to ACE2 is:and that of 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 is:With equation 1 and all the sampled binding conformations in Figs. 1A and 3A, the binding free\u2329\u2206 4564\u232a = -36.6 kcal\u00b7mol-1\u2329\u2206789:\u232a = -27.2 kcal\u00b7mol-1By comparing the values, we found that 2019-nCoV S-RBD reaches about 73% of the binding strengthof SARS-CoV S-RBD to ACE2. Since the receptor-binding of S-protein is the major driving force forthe viral transmission to the human host cell, such a strength order implies that 2019-nCoV might beable to infect humans similar to as SARS-CoV.Just after the 2019-nCoV genome sequencing, Xu et al. also used structural modeling approach topredict the binding affinity of S-RBD to ACE2(Xu et al., 2020). In their study, two single complexconformations (i.e., crystal and predicted structures) were employed to calculate the binding freeenergies of two CoVs, and showed that the affinity of 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 was in the orderof ~65% of that for SARS-CoV. So, their predicted strength is about 10% lower than our estimates.Certainly, although our values were calculated using a large-number of thermodynamically probable,low-energy binding conformations, further experimental measurements will be needed to testify theaccuracy of both methods.We have performed large-scale protein-protein docking to evaluate the binding affinities ofSARSCoV and 2019-nCoV S-protein RBDs to the human receptor ACE2, in order to quantitatively assessthe human receptor-binding capability of 2019-nCoV. Using the well-investigated SARS-CoV as thereference, our results showed that 2019-nCoV reaches about 73% of the ACE2 receptor-bindingstrength of SARS-CoV. This supports that the 2019-nCoV S-protein encoded by its genome hasprocessed human receptor-binding ability close to that of SARS-CoV, and thus this newly emergedvirus is likely able to bind to ACE2 and then to drive human-to-human transmission. However, thedocking sampling for a large number of thermodynamically probable conformations did not find anybinding conformation with an energy score lower than that of the lowest-energy conformation ofSARS-CoV derived from experimentally determined structure (Figs. 1A and 3A), offering molecularevidence that the receptor-binding ability of 2019-nCoV is less than that of SARS-CoV.Of course, ultimate confirmation of computational predictions requires experimental verification,which will also be very important for improving our method in the future. However, experimentalapproaches for deeply understanding the human transmission of viruses in terms of receptor-bindinginteractions and specificity is rather time consuming. Sometimes, it might be even impossible toemploy experimental methods to thoroughly examine every evolved, mutant strain of a newly emergedvirus, such as 2019-nCoV in our case. As an alternative, using a high-performance computer, ourapproach may assess the receptor-binding capability of a newly identified strain within one day. Thus,our method can be useful for the post-genome analysis for a newly identified CoV and its mutantstrains, with the first-determined genome data. Note that, although viral genome data provide usefulsequence information for comparison-based assessments with previously identified viruses, these datathemselves do not offer hints about how the encoded viral proteins carry out their functions which maylead to serious human infections and diseases. Hence, post-genome analysis of viral protein functionsis valuable not only for understanding the viruses themselves, but also for offering useful scientificsupports for making effective, early decision about viral prevention and control.In summary, this study presents a fast method for accurately assessing the human transmissioncapability of newly emerged CoVs, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of CoVproteinprotein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for the viral prevention and control.protein was taken from the first genome sequence of a 2019-nCoV isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1) deposited inS-RBD was built according to standard modeling procedure on the SWISS-MODEL server athttps://swissmodel.expasy.org, by submitting its amino-acid sequence in Fig. 2A and then selecting theSARS-CoV S-RBD structure (PDB 2AJF) as the modeling template. With the obtained model,highresolution all-atom refinements were then carried out to optimize the conformations of the proteinbackbone and side-chains with the relax program of the Rosetta software suite(Das and Baker, 2008).And the Rosetta all-atom energy function 2015 (REF15) was employed to calculate the conformationalenergy(Alford et al., 2017).

Docking protocols with fullreceptor flexibility were used. For each S-RBD-ACE2 pair, at least 3,000 independent dockingsimulations were performed to generate a large number of thermodynamically probable, low-energybinding conformations for evaluating the binding free-energy.

Ten\nyears later, MERS emerged in Saudi Arabia and spread to different countries with a fatality rate of\nabout 35%(WHO, 2016). Both viruses are of zoonotic nature: SARS-CoV originates from bats/civet\ncats(Ge et al., 2013), and dromedary camels are the major reservoir host of MERS(Reusken et al.,\n2016). Nevertheless, both viruses are known to transmit from human to human(de Wit et al., 2016). A\nfew other CoVs of zoonotic origin are circulating endemic in the human population, which cause mild\ninfections of the respiratory tract, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1(Gaunt et al., 2010).", "one_words_summarize": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-stranded enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the Nidovirales order,and are classified into four genera: a, b, d and g. Two of the b-CoVs, the server acute respiratorysyndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), havecaused serious epidemic-like outbreaks. 2010).In December, 2019, a novel CoV (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan in China, and spreadrapidly from this area to the globe(Holshue et al., And, it is evidentthat a human-to-human transmission is causing the rapid spreading of this virus. Viral strains frominfected persons of the area have been sequenced arguing for a common ancestor as there was onlylittle genetic variation found(Rambaut, 2020). Sequence alignment of S1-proteins has revealed a sequence identity of about 75% between that of2019-nCoV and those of several other CoVs including SARS-CoV        Here, we employ protein-protein docking approach to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoVSRBD with ACE2, based on the experimentally determined complex structure of SARS-CoV S-RBDcomplexed with ACE2(Li et al., 2005) and on the predicted structure of 2019-nCoV S-protein RBDaccording to gene sequence. 2011), such asantibody-antigen interacting structures(Weitzner et al., Therefore, we could use the average binding energy scoresof these conformations as an experiment-based energy reference to characterize the binding strengthof 2019-nCoV S-RBD to ACE2 and to deduce its binding strength relative to that of SARS-CoV.Obviously, such a comparison assessment avoids using the calculated, absolute free-energy scores tocorrelate with the binding strength, which might systematically differ from the actual measurementvalues because of the intrinsic, theoretical approximations of the used Rosetta all-atom energy function(Alford et al., However, experimentalapproaches for deeply understanding the human transmission of viruses in terms of receptor-bindinginteractions and specificity is rather time consuming. Sometimes, it might be even impossible toemploy experimental methods to thoroughly examine every evolved, mutant strain of a newly emergedvirus, such as 2019-nCoV in our case. In summary, this study presents a fast method for accurately assessing the human transmissioncapability of newly emerged CoVs, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of CoVproteinprotein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for the viral prevention and control.protein was taken from the first genome sequence of a 2019-nCoV isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1) deposited inS-RBD was built according to standard modeling procedure on the SWISS-MODEL server athttps://swissmodel.expasy.org, by submitting its amino-acid sequence in Fig. The all-atom relax protocols are:relax.linxgccrelease /\u2013database $database_path /-s $start_model.pdb /-relax:thorough /\u2013nstruct $model_numberLocal protein-protein docking.
