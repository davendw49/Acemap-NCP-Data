Despite the scarcity of publicly available data,scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of theepidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently moreevidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novelcoronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess thetransmission potential of emerging disease. The present study aimed to estimates of thetransmissibility and virulence of 2019\u2013nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructingthe underlying transmission dynamics.We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointlyderive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus.For estimation, the daily series of laboratory\u2013confirmed nCov cases and deaths inWuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on boardgovernment\u2013chartered flights were used.4243444546474849505152535455565758We found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City,China in 2019\u20132020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11\u20138.18) and theenhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 has declined R to 3.24(95%CrI: 3.16\u20133.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections)estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475\u2013 1296258) in Wuhan City, raising the proportionof infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI: 7.6\u201313.0%). We also found that most recentcrude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time\u2013delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be0.07% (95% CrI: 0.05%\u20130.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17\u20130.30%), which is severalorders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06%We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulenceof 2019\u2013nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach.The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters withquantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182BackgroundThe novel coronavirus (2019\u2013nCoV) emerging from China is a deadlyrespiratory pathogen that belongs to the same family as the coronavirus responsible forthe 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks [1]. Since thefirst cluster of cases was identified in Wuhan City, China, in December, 2019,2019\u2013nCoV has rapidly spread across China as well as caused multiple introductions in25 countries as of February, 2020 [2]. Nevertheless, China is bearing the burden of thisemerging infectious disease, especially the city of Wuhan located in Hubei province,where the first cluster of severe pneumonia caused by the novel virus was identified.Meanwhile, the cumulative number of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths inmainland China has reached 28001 and 642, respectively, as of February 5th, 2020 [2].          Because the morbidity and mortality burden associated with the novelcoronavirus has disproportionally affected the city of Wuhan, the central government ofthe People's Republic of China imposed a lockdown and social distancing measures inthis city and surrounding areas starting on January 23rd 2020. Indeed, out of the 280012019-nCov cases reported in China, 11618 cases (37.3%) are from Wuhan City. In termsof the death count, a total of 478 deaths (74.5%) have occurred in Wuhan city out of the642 deaths reported throughout China. To guide the effectiveness of interventions, it iscrucial to gauge the uncertainty relating to key epidemiological parameters relating tothe transmissibility and the severity of the disease. Despite the scarcity of publiclyavailable data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating themagnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns[          Epidemiological dataWe linked our model to two different datasets. First, the daily series oflaboratory\u2013confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City were extracted according todate of symptoms onset or reporting date from several sources [2, 8-9]. As of February8th, 2020, a total of 14982 confirmed cases including 608 deaths were reported inWuhan City. Second, epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City onboard government\u2013chartered flights were obtained from the Japanese government. Afterarriving in Japan, all of the Japanese evacuees were kept in isolation for about 14 daysand examined for infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [6]. As of February9th, a total of four flights left Wuhan City. We collected information on the dates whenthose fights left Wuhan City and the number of passengers with confirmed cases tocalibrate our model (Table S1)Statistical analysisrespectively.Using the following integral equation model, we estimate the reproductionnumber of 2019-nCov. Here, infected and reported cases are denoted by i and c,We connected a daily incidence series with a discrete\u2013time integral equation todescribe the epidemic dynamics. Let gs denote the probability mass function of theserial interval, e.g., the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in thesecondary case, of length s days, which is given bys s 1 ,For s >0 where G(.) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gammadistribution. Mathematically, we describe the expected number of new cases with day t,E[c(t)] as follows,where E[c(t)] represents the expected number of new cases with onset day t, where Rrepresents the average number of secondary cases per case.106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125Subsequently, we also employed the time\u2013dependent variation in R to take intoaccount the impact of enhanced interventions on the transmission potential. This timedependence was modelled by introducing a parameter \u03b41, which is given by1ifotherwise ,where period1 represents the corresponding period from the start of studyperiod to January 23rd 2020, when the central government of the People's Republic ofChina imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei in an effort to quarantinethe epicentre of the coronavirus (2019\u2013nCoV) to mitigate transmission while parameter\u03b21 scales the extent of the intervention, taking values smaller than 1[10].To account for the probability of occurrence, \u03b8 [11] ,we assume that the numberof observed cases on day t, h(t), occurred according to a Bernoulli sampling process,with the expected values E(ct;Ht\u20131), where E(ct; Ht\u20131) denotes the conditional expected126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142incidence on day t, given the history of observed data from day 1 to day (t\u20131), denotedby Ht\u20131. Thus, the number of expected newly observed cases is written as follows:E &; ()Further, we model the time\u2013dependent variation in the reporting probability.This time dependence was modelled by introducing a parameter \u03b42, which is given by- . ,. ,ififotherwise,,,%where period2 and period3 represents the corresponding periods from the start of ourstudy period to the Jan 17, and from Jan 18 to Jan 20, respectively, while \u03b11 and \u03b12 scalethe extent of the reporting probability (where \u03b11 and \u03b12 is expected to be smaller than 1),motivated by a previous study [12]. The number of expected newly observed casesshould be updated asE &; ()employ to estimate the effective reproduction number and other relevant parameters isgiven by:0 1;where U indicates parameter sets that are estimated from this likelihood.Subsequently, the conditional probability of non\u2013infection given residents inWuhan City at the time point of ti, pti, was assumed to follow a binomial distribution,and the likelihood function is given by:1431441451461471481491501511521531541551561571581591601610 5; 6 , 7 8 3674518,            Where Mti and mti is the number of government charted flight passengers andnon\u2013infected passengers at the date of ti, respecitively, and pti is the proportion of theestimated non\u2013infected population in Wuhan at the date of ti, calculated from the h(t)and catchment population in Wuhan City [            Serial interval estimates of 2019\u2013nCov were derived from previous studies ofnCov, indicating that it follows a gamma distribution with the mean and SD at 7.5 and3.4 days, respectively, based on ref. [14]. The maximum value of the serial interval wasfixed at 28 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution upto 28 days reaches 0.999.Crude CFR and crude IFR is defined as the number of cumulative deathsdivided by the number of cumulative cases or infections at a specific point in timewithout adjusting the time delay from illness onset or hospitalization to death. Next, weemployed an integral equation model in order to estimate the real\u2013time IFR. First, weestimated the real\u2013time CFR as described elsewhere [15-17]. For the estimation, weemploy the delay from hospitalization to death, fs, which is assumed to be given by fs =F(s) \u2013 F(s\u20131) for s>0 where H(s) follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days andSD 5.4 days, obtained from the available observed data [18].16216316416516616716816917017117217317417517617717817909; , *2 :< , =9?=19\u2211;\u2211\u2211\u2211?\u2211where ct represents the number of new cases with reported day t, and Dt is the number ofnew deaths with reported day ti [2,8-9, 18]. We assume that the cumulative number ofobserved deaths, Dt is the result of the binomial sampling process with probability \u03c0.Subsequently, crude IFR and time\u2013delay adjusted IFR are calculated using the estimated\u03c0 and ht.The total likelihood is calculated as L=L1L2L3 and model parameters wereestimated using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method in a Bayesianframework. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated based onsampling from the three Markov chains. For each chain, we drew 100,000 samples fromthe posterior distribution after a burn\u2013in of 20,000 iterations. Convergence of MCMCchains were evaluated using the potential scale reduction statistic [19-20]. Estimates and95% credibility intervals for these estimates are based on the posterior probabilitydistribution of each parameter and based on the samples drawn from the posteriordistributions. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.2 (R Foundationfor Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) using the \u2018rstan\u2019 package.ResultsThe daily series of 2019\u2013nCoV laboratory\u2013confirmed incidence and180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196197198199200201202203cumulative incidence in Wuhan in 2019\u20132020 are displayed in Figure 1. Overall, ourdynamical models yield a good fit to the temporal dynamics (i.e. incidence, cumulativeincidence) including an exponential growth pattern in Wuhan. In incidence data, a fewfluctuations are seen, probably indicating surveillance system likely missed many casesduring the early transmission phase (Figure 1).Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, Chinain 2019\u20132020 was estimated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11\u20138.18). Thetime\u2013dependent scaling factor quantifying the extent of enhanced public healthintervention on R is 0.46 (95%CrI: 0.39\u20130.54) and this has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI:occurrence and reporting rate are 0.97 (95% CrI: 0.82\u20131.00) and 0.015 (95% CrI:0.012\u20130.02), respectively. Moreover, the time\u2013dependent scaling factor quantifying theextent of reporting rate, \u03b1, is estimated to be 0.08 (95% CrI: 0.03\u20130.21) before January17 and to be 0.98 (95% CrI: 0.91\u20131.00) from January 17 to January 20.The total number of estimated laboratory\u2013confirmed cases (i.e. cumulativecases) is 14433 (95% CrI: 12339\u201315104) and respectively, while the actual numbers ofreported laboratory\u2013confirmed cases during our study period is 14982. Moreover, weinferred the total number of 2019\u2013nCov infections (Figure S1). Our results indicate thatthe total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) is 983006 (95%CrI: 759475\u20131296258).The Observed and posterior estimates of the cumulative number of deaths ofthe 2019\u2013nCov epidemic in Wuhan are displayed in Figure 2, and model\u2013basedposterior estimates of the cumulative number of deaths is 610 (95%CrI: 546\u2013680),while actual number of reported deaths is 608.

Furthermore, Figure 3A and 3B illustrates time\u2013delay no\u2013adjustedIFR and time\u2013delay adjusted IFR, respectively.The latest estimate of the crude CFR and time\u2013delay adjusted CFR in Wuhanappeared to be 4.51% (95% CrI: 4.02\u20135.32%) and 15.93% (95% CrI: 14.60\u201317.28%),respectively, whereas the latest model\u2013based posterior estimates of time\u2013delay notadjusted IFR and adjusted IFR, presented in Figure 3 C and D, are 0.07%(95% CrI:0.05%\u20130.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17\u20130.30%), respectively, while the observedcrude CFR is calculated to be 4.06% (Table 1).In this study we derived estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of2019\u2013nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmissiondynamics. Applying dynamic modeling, the reproduction number and death risks aswell as probabilities of occurrence and reporting rate were estimated.Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, Chinain 2019\u20132020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11\u20138.18). Thetime\u2013dependent scaling factor quantifying the extent of enhanced public healthintervention on R is 0.46 (95%CrI: 0.39\u20130.54) and this has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI:transmission dynamics modify the impact of 2019\u2013Cov, with the total number of227228229230231232233234235236237238239240241242243244245246247248249250infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475\u2013 1296258)in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI:sustained high R values in Wuhan City even after the lockdown and mobilityrestrictions suggests that transmission is occurring inside the household or in healthcaresettings [19], which is a landmark of past SARS and MERS outbreaks[20-21].Considering the potent transmissibility of 2019-nCov in confined settings, asillustrated by the ongoing 2019-nCov outbreak aboard a cruise ship, the DiamondPrincess, where the total number of secondary or tertiary infections has reached 135 asof February 10th, 2020 [22], it is crucial to prevent further hospital-based transmissionby strengthening infection control measures.Our most recent estimates of the crude CFR and time\u2013delay adjusted CFR areat 4.51% (95% CrI: 4.02\u20135.32%) and 15.93% (95% CrI: 14.60\u201317.28%), respectively.In contrast, our most recent crude IFR and time\u2013delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be0.07%(95% CrI: 0.05%\u20130.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17\u20130.30%), which is severalorders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06%. These findings indicate thatthe death risk in Wuhan is estimated to be much higher than those in other areas, whichis likely explained by hospital-based transmission [23-24]. Indeed, past nosocomialoutbreaks have been reported to elevate the CFR associated with MERS and SARSoutbreaks, where inpatients affected by underlying disease or seniors infected in thehospital setting have raised the CFR to values as high as 20% for a MERS outbreak            Public health authorities are interested in quantifying R and CFR to measurethe transmission potential and virulence of an infectious disease, especially when251252253254255256257258259260261262263264265266267268269270271272273emerging/re\u2013emerging epidemics occur in order to decide the intensity of the publichealth response. Given a substantial portion of unobserved infections due to 2019\u2013nCov,R estimates derived from infections and IFR are probably more realistic than R solelyderived from observed cases and the CFR as an index. [            Our analysis also revealed a high probability of occurrence and quite lowreporting probabilities in Wuhan City. High probability of occurrence in the aboveequation suggests that zero observed cases at some point is not due to the absence ofthose infected, but due to a low reporting rate. A very low reporting probability suggeststhat it is difficult to diagnose 2019\u2013nCov cases or a breakdown in medical care delivery.Moreover, we also identified a remarkable change in reporting rate, estimated to be12\u2013fold lower in the 1st period (\u2013Jan 16, 2020) and about the same during the 2nd period(January 17 \u2013 20, 2020), relative to the that estimated after January 21st 2020.Our results are not free from the limitations. First, our methodology aims to capture theunderlying transmission dynamics. By implementing mass screening in certainpopulations is a useful approach to ascertain the real proportion of those infected and away of adding credibility to the estimated values. Second, it is worth noting that the dataof Japanese evacuee employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the Wuhancatchment population. Indeed, it also plausible that their risk of infection in this sampleis not as high as local residents in Wuhan, underestimating the reproduction number.In summary, we have estimated key epidemiological parameters of thetransmissibility and virulence of 2019\u2013nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using anecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to inferepidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observationscollected by surveillance systems.CFR: Case fatality ratio, IFR: Infection Fatality ratio, SARS: Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome, MERS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome274275276277278279280281282284285286287288289290291292Additional files283Additional file 1:Appendix.

Despite the scarcity of publicly available data,scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of theepidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently moreevidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novelcoronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess thetransmission potential of emerging disease. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters withquantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182BackgroundThe novel coronavirus (2019\u2013nCoV) emerging from China is a deadlyrespiratory pathogen that belongs to the same family as the coronavirus responsible forthe 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreaks [1]. Afterarriving in Japan, all of the Japanese evacuees were kept in isolation for about 14 daysand examined for infection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [6]. Using the following integral equation model, we estimate the reproductionnumber of 2019-nCov. represents the cumulative distribution function of the gammadistribution. This time dependence was modelled by introducing a parameter \u03b42, which is given by- . ,. , The number of expected newly observed casesshould be updated asE &; ()employ to estimate the effective reproduction number and other relevant parameters isgiven by:0 1;where U indicates parameter sets that are estimated from this likelihood. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated based onsampling from the three Markov chains. Overall, ourdynamical models yield a good fit to the temporal dynamics (i.e. incidence, cumulativeincidence) including an exponential growth pattern in Wuhan. In incidence data, a fewfluctuations are seen, probably indicating surveillance system likely missed many casesduring the early transmission phase (Figure 1).Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, Chinain 2019\u20132020 was estimated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11\u20138.18). Given a substantial portion of unobserved infections due to 2019\u2013nCov,R estimates derived from infections and IFR are probably more realistic than R solelyderived from observed cases and the CFR as an index. [ First, our methodology aims to capture theunderlying transmission dynamics. The power of our approach lies in the ability to inferepidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observationscollected by surveillance systems.
