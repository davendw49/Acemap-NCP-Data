Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the \u201cseed cases\u201d from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054\u00d7x1+2.3455\u00d7x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model. Big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health.", "text": "        Since Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, a no ve l co ro na vi rus , emerged onDecember 1, 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China                To prevent further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, 31 Provinces in China Mainland had raised their public healthresponse level to the highest state of emergency (level-1) by January 29, 2020. The Chinese government hasimplemented a series of large-scale public health interventions to control the epidemic, many of which have farexceeded what International Health Regulations required, especially Wuhan lock-down, nationwide trafficrestrictions and Stay At Home Movement. Wuhan had prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00on January 23, 2020, this is maybe the largest quarantine/movement restriction in human history to preventinfectious disease spread        Due to Wuhan lock-down, more than 9 million residents were isolated in Wuhan City since January 23, 2020,only 1.2 million travelers from or to Wuhan during January 24 to February 15, 2020 according to BaiduMigration. The travelers were down 91.61% and 91.62%, compared to the same period last year (14 million) andthe first 23d (14 million from January 1 to January 23, 2020), respectively (Fig.1).2020 according to Baidu Migration. The emigrants were down 69.77% and 67.60%, compared to the same periodlast year (611 million) and the first 23d (570 million), respectively (Fig.2).Due to Stay At Home Movement, the mean intensity of intra-city activities for 316 cities was 2.61/d duringJanuary 24 to February 15, 2020 according to Baidu Migration. It was down 42.42% and 50.27% when comparedto the same period last year (4.53/d) and the first 23d (5.25/d), respectively (Fig.3).the same period last yearObviously, COVID-19 greatly reduced the human mobility of China Mainland.We consider 44 regions in China Mainland which accept travelers from Wuhan, including 29 Provinces (Tibetwas excluded since only one confirmed case was reported) and 15 prefecture-level cities in Hubei province. Wenoticed that the number of confirmed cases between non-Hubei and Hubei were closer in the early period. Forexample, the number of cumulative confirmed cases by the end of January 26 in Chongqing (non-Hubei) andXiaogan (Hubei) were 110 and 100, respectively. Their cumulative confirmed cases by the end of February 27,however, were 576 and 3,517, respectively. We surmise that this is partly because Xiaogan has received moreinfected cases from Wuhan than Chongqing since the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 wasconfirmed and announced on January 20.        This surmise was confirmed by Fig.4. The proportion of travelers from Wuhan accepted by Hubei regions to thetotal travelers from Wuhan increased rapidly from 70% (before January 19) to 74% (January 20), even over 77%after January 26. So we concluded that the first key factor affecting the later (e.g. February 27) cumulativeconfirmed cases of each non-Wuhan region is the sum immigrants from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26(few immigrants after January 27). These immigrants had higher infected probability but lower transmissionability because the susceptible strengthened protection awareness and measures after the declaration ofhuman-to-human transmission.before and after warning dateThe second key factor is the sum number of the infected immigrants from Wuhan before January 19. Accordingto the recent report, there is a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection, comprising a mean about 5day incubation period and a mean 5 day delay from symptom onset to detection of a case        y= 70.0916+0.0054\u00d7x1+2.3455\u00d7x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7)Here, y is the number of cumulative confirmed cases by February 27 of each non-Wuhan region, x1 is the sumnumber of immigrants from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 of each non-Wuhan region, and x2 is thenumber of cumulative confirmed cases by January 29 of each non-Wuhan region.The standard regression coefficients of x1 and x2 are 0.6620 and 0.3796 respectively, indicating that x1 is moreimportant than x2 for determining y. The observed and expected values of the cumulative confirmed cases byFebruary 27 of each non-Wuhan regions were shown in Fig.5.40002000Observed value30004000non-Wuhan regionTo evaluate the effect of Wuhan lock-down, x2, the number of cumulative confirmed cases by January 29, shouldbe fixed. Then we assumed three different lock-down plans besides the real plan (Table 1).According to Table 1, even the lock-down date only delay 3 days, the estimated sum number of cumulativeconfirmed cases by February 27 in 44 non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% (41,477 cases), compared withthe real plan (30,675 cases). On the contrary, even the lock-down date only in advance 3 days with normal andstrict strength, the estimated number will reduce 30.74% (21,245 cases) and 48.59% (15,768 cases), respectively.It is clearly that Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movementhave a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland according to ourinterpretative model.Lock-down date/strengthJanuary 23/NormalJanuary 20/NormalJanuary 20/Strict*January 26/NormalIt's not fair to assess the effort of different regions only based on the final number of cumulative confirmed casesdue to the difference of the number of immigrants from Wuhan. The aforementioned interpretative model hastaken this difference into account and the results are listed with 5 grade (Excellent, Good, Normal, Poor, Verypoor) according to standard residuals (Table 2 and Table 3). We emphasize that this is only a preliminaryevaluation and the results are for reference only.The human mobility data on inter-city travel and intra-city activity from January 1, 2020 to February 21, 2020(including the same period data in 2019) in China Mainland is from Baidu Migration (http://qianxi.baidu.com).The inter-city travel population of each city is represented with immigration and emigration index, the travelersproportions of different destination and departure, on the level of Province and city (but only the top 100 cities),are also listed. The intra-city activity intensity of each city is represented with the index (not proportion) of#: Only the city which the confirmed cases by February 27 more than 90 was assessed. *: the confirmed cases by February 27.activity population to total population.Real immigration and emigration populations of Beijing and Shanghai, emigration populations of Wuhan,Nanjing, Qingdao, Shenzhen and Foshan during the 2019 Spring Festival travel rush (40d) are from their Officialwebsite of the Transportation Commission. We estimate one Baidu Migration index is about equal to 56,137travelers (Fig.6).China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml) and its affiliates.        Baidu Migration recorded more types of spatial displacement, including airplane, high-speed rail, ship, coach andprivate car, so it theoretically has higher accuracy. The real inter-city travel population of each city, however, isdifficult to estimate because Baidu Migration can only list the migration index and the proportion. Based on acomplicated hyper-network model        It is worth noting that the Baidu Migration index still has the following disadvantages for estimating real travelerpopulation. 1) The mobility behavior of a large number of groups un-connected to Baidu Map and third-partyusers has not been recorded. 2) The spatial displacement of users is recorded only within 8 hours. 3) Most of thetrips are disassembled and not fully identified. For example, one user travel from A, pass through B and arrivefinal destination C, and the user also has location information in C by coincidence, then this trip will bedisassembled into A-B and B-C. Regardless, big data has and will continue to play an important role in publichealth.Several models have estimated the number of infected individuals in Wuhan. Based on the domestic andinternational confirmed case, Imai et al (2020) estimated that the total number of infected individuals was 21,022(CI: 11,090-33,490) by January 22. Based on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally, numberof international flights arriving in Wuhan and the latest human mobility data from Tencent, Wu et al (2020)estimated that the total number was 75,815 (CI: 37,304-130,330) by January 25. Based on the meta-data of fivecountries\u2019 evacuation action from January 29 to February 2, Zhao et al (2020) estimated that almost 110,000 (CI:40,000-310,000) individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan by February 2. Wang et al (2020)estimated 4 phases divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken ineffect in Wuhan, the number of infections would reach the peak 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393 in lateFebruary.There are 9.48 million residents in Wuhan around January 26, the cumulative confirmed cases are 2,261 byJanuary 29. We estimate at least 56,916 people were infected in Wuhan according to our model (up to February27 the confirmed cases are 48,137). In other words, more than 8,000 undetected but infected individuals still waitfor checking out in the center of epidemic storm. Wuhan still has much to do.        SARS-CoV-2 has diversity transmission approaches, including respiratory (mouth foam) and contact routeswhich have been confirmed, as well as aerosol and digestive (fecal-oral) routes which cannot be ruled out(National Health Commission of China, 2020). It is also highly concealed according to the recent report oftransmission of the virus from asymptomatic and mild individuals        SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, Wang et al (2020) projected that without any control measure the infectedpopulation would exceed 200,000 in Wuhan by the end of February. As for Steven et al (2020) and Read et al(2020), the estimated number was 233,400 (CI: 38,757-778,278) by the end of January and 191,529 (CI:132,751-273,649) by February 4, respectively. Up to February 27, the confirmed cases are 48,137.The only lesson that humans have learned from history is that humans have not learned anything from history.Clearly, Wuhan has not learned anything from the SARS epidemic in 2003, now she is suffering from her earlydelays. Fortunately, China Government has implemented a series of large-scale public health interventions tocontrol the epidemic. In fact, many prevention and control measures taken by China, especially Wuhanlock-down, nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, go far beyond the requirements forresponding to emergencies, setting new benchmarks for epidemic prevention in other countries. The Chinesemethod has proven to be successful. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newlydiagnosed cases, and the simplest and most direct thing that can explain this is the data (Fig.7).The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is still rapidly growing and spread to more than 42 countries as of February 27, 2020.At present, the most serious countries outside China are South Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan. It is worrying thatalthough some measures have been taken, the current prevention and control measures of these countries maystill be insufficient. None of them has reached the level of prevention and control in China's moderately affectingProvinces some time ago. The controllable window period is narrowing, the international community shouldlearn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China.
