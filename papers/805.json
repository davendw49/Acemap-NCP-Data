Within thislibrary, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication incultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus.The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19)replication (EC90) was 6.3 \u03bcM. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in thepresence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an aminoacid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reversegenetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonidesuppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonidewas specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patientssuffering MERS or COVID-19.        The COVID-19 outbreak began on December 2019 in Wuhan, China (                Systemic treatment with corticosteroids is contraindicated for the severe pneumonia causedby viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as steroids suppress the innate immunesystem, resulting in increased viral replication. In fact, for SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2013,treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased mortality (        Steroid compounds, which are expected to have dual functions in blocking both coronavirusreplication and host inflammation, were screened from a chemical library. The cytopathiceffect caused by MERS-CoV infection was measured to evaluate viral replication. Foursteroid compounds, ciclesonide, mometasone furoate, mifepristone, and algestoneacetophenide conferred a greater than 95% cell survival rate (Fig. S1).Next, concentration-dependent viral growth suppression and drug cytotoxicity wereassessed. Ciclesonide exhibited low cytotoxicity and potent suppression of viral growth (Fig.1a). Cortisone and prednisolone, which are commonly used for systemic steroid treatment,dexamethasone, which has strong immunosuppressant effects, and fluticasone, acommonly used inhaled steroid, did not suppress viral growth (Fig. 1a).        The antiviral effects of steroids against various species of viruses were tested by quantifyingpropagated virus in culture medium. Ciclesonide and mometasone also suppressedreplication of other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV, but not replication of RSvirus or influenza virus (Fig. S2). In addition, ciclesonide slightly but significantly inhibitedrubella virus (having positive strand RNA genome) replication (Fig. S2), suggesting thatciclesonide interacted with the replication site of positive-strand RNA virus intracellularly.To identify the drug target of virus replication, we conducted 11 consecutive MERS-CoVpassages in the presence of 40 \u03bcM ciclesonide or 40 \u03bcM mometasone. A mutant virus thatdeveloped resistance ciclesonide was generated (Fig. 1b), but no resistant virus tomometasone was generated. Next-generation sequencing identified that an amino acidsubstitution at A25V (C19647T in the reference sequence NC_019843.3) in nonstructuralprotein 15 (NSP15), coronavirus endoribonuclease (        This study suggests that ciclesonide presumably interacts with viral NSP15, either directly orindirectly, to suppress viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. An amino acid substitution in theciclesonide-resistant mutant, located at the dimerization site of the NSP15 homo-hexamer(12), suggested that ciclesonide interacts with NSP15 during viral biogenesis. Future studieswill provide a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms of ciclesonide suppression ofviral replication.Ciclesonide is a safe drug, and can be administered to infants at high concentrations.Inhaled ciclesonide is expected to reduce viral replication and host inflammation in the lungs,with decreased immunosuppressive effects compared to systemic corticosteroids, asciclesonide primarily remains in the lung tissue, and does not significantly enter thebloodstream. Treatment of patients with ciclesonide should be carefully evaluated,considering the benefit-risk balance of the drug.Cells and viruses. Vero cells and VeroE6 cells expressing TMPRSS2 (VeroE6/TMPRSS2)were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, USA)supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco-BRL, USA). MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2were propagated in Vero and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.Steroids and inhibitors. The following compounds were used: cortisone, prednisolone,fluticasone, dexamethasone, algestone acetophenide, mifepristone, mometasone furoate,and ciclesonide (from Prestwick the Chemical Library ;PerkinElmer, MA, USA), nafamostat(N0289; Sigma), camostat (3193; Tocris Bioscience, USA), E64d (330005; Calbiochem,USA), and lopinavir (SML1222; Sigma).        Quantification of coronaviral RNA. Confluent cells in 96-well plates were inoculated withvirus in the presence of steroid compounds. Cellular RNA was isolated at 6 hourspost-infection (hpi) using a CellAmp Direct RNA Prep Kit (3732; Takara, Japan) and culturemedium collected at 24 hpi or 27 hpi was diluted 10-fold in water, then boiled. A real-timePCR assay was performed to quantify the amount of coronavirus RNA with a MyGo Proinstrument (IT-IS Life Science, Ireland) using primers and probes described previously (        Cytotoxicity Assays. Confluent cells in 96-well plates were treated with steroids. Afterincubation for 24 or 27 hours, a cell viability assay was performed using WST reagent(CK12; Dojin Lab, Japan) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.        chromosome (BAC) clone carrying the full-length infectious genome of the MERS-CoVEMC2012 strain was used to generate recombinant MERS-CoV, as described previously(        Statistical analysis.
