Presence of SARS-CoV-2 has beenconstantly reported in stools of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).However, there is a paucity of data concerning fecal shedding of the virus in pediatricObjective: To investigate dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory and fecalspecimens in children with COVID-19.Methods: From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory,and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-timefluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed todetect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Patients were followed up toMarch 10, 2020, the final date of follow-up, and dynamic profiles of RT-PCR results wereclosely monitored.Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptomsdeveloped earlier. Severity of disease was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistentand predominant symptom at onset of illness of these children (two cases had bodytemperature higher than 38.5\u00b0C). All children showed increased lymphocytes (>4.4\u00d7109/L)with normal white blood cell counts on admission. Radiological changes were not typical forCOVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance ofSARSCoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas viralRNA remained positive in stools of pediatric patients for longer than 4 weeks. Two childrenhad fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 20 days after throat swabs showing negative, whilethat of another child lagged behind for 8 days.Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 may exist in gastrointestinal tract for a longer time thanrespiratory system. Persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected childrenindicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive effortsshould be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children afterreopening of kindergartens and schools.On December 12, 2019, 27 pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, HubeiProvince, China.1 The etiological agent was identified as a novel coronavirus and was laterrenamed as severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the world healthorganization (WHO).2,3 The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreakedhavoc in China and spread rapidly to about ninety countries, constituting a global threat withthe highest risk impact.4 Epidemiological evidence gained in China suggested that mostindividuals lack relevant immunity and are generally susceptible to the virus. The majority ofpublished studies of COVID-19 focused on adult populations.5-8 While knowledge onSARSCoV-2 infection in children are still yet to be fully developed and only a limited number ofcase reports of pediatric patients are currently available.9-12As of February 23, 2020, a cumulative total of 60 confirmed COVID-19 cases werereported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, of which three cases (5%) were childrenunder 10 years of age. Pediatric patients presented clinical characteristics distinct from thoseobserved in adult patients. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the stool of thesechildren 8-20 days after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory specimens. Whereasthe majority of adult patients had negative results of nucleic acid testing in respiratory andfecal specimens synchronously. Prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces aftershowing negative in respiratory specimens may become a source of COVID-19 in thecommunity and pose a threat to public health if fitness for discharge is based on the currentversion of Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (\u201cwith normal bodytemperature for more than 3 days\u201d, \u201cwith obvious features of absorption of inflammationshown in lung imaging\u201d and \u201cnegative results of the nucleic acid tests of respiratorypathogens for consecutive two times [sampling interval at least 1 day]\u201d).13From January 17, 2020 to February 23, 2020, a total of 60 patients were diagnosed withCOVID-19 in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. We recruited all three pediatric patientswith laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were reported by the local healthauthority. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the WHO interim guidance.14 Patients werefollowed up on a regular basis after hospital discharge till March 10, 2020.This study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Qingdao Women and Children\u2019sHospital (QFFLL-KY-2020-11) and written informed consent was obtained from patients\u2019legal guardians prior to enrolment.Personal, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomesinformation were obtained with standardized data collection forms from electronic medicalrecords. Additionally, we directly contacted patients\u2019 families to ascertain epidemiologicaland symptom information. Data were entered into a computerized database anddoublechecked by two researchers independently.Throat swabs were obtained from patients on admission. Fecal specimens were first collectedin two patients (case 1, 1.5-year-old male; and case 2, 5-year-old male) on day 4 after onsetof the disease. While the stool sample from another patient (case 3, 6-year-old female) wasobtained 9 days after hospital discharge. To monitor the dynamic changes of viral shedding,we obtained throat swabs from patients every day during hospitalization and every other dayduring follow-up after discharge. Fecal specimens were collected applying a similar rationalesince the first day of sample collection (samples from case 3 were only collected duringfollow-up period). Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time fluorescencereverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a commercial kit approvedby the China Food and15Severity of disease in all patients was mild according to Diagnosis and Treatment Plan ofCorona Virus Disease 2019 (tentative fifth/sixth edition).16,17 The disease started with fever(\u226738.5\u00b0C) in all of the three children. None of them developed severe complications norrequired intensive care or mechanical ventilation. All children showed good response tosupportive treatment including inhalation of interferon, oral Ribavirin and traditional Chinesemedicine.Laboratory findings of these children on admission to hospital are shown in Table 1. Onadmission, all the children had increased lymphocyte count (>4.4\u00d7109/L). Only case 1showed decreased neutrophil count (<1.7\u00d7109/L), whereas those of the other two childrenwere within normal range. Elevation of platelets was observed in case 1 and case 2. Case 3had increased levels of procalcitonin (0.73 ng/mL) and C-reaction protein (10.5 mg/L), whileserum level of D-dimer (860.0 ng/mL) was found elevated in case 1. Reduced level of serumcreatinine was detected in case 1 and case 2 (<41.0 \u00b5mol/L). Transverse chest computedtomograms (CT) showed delicate patches of ground glass opacity of lower lobe of right lungin case 1 on day 1 after symptom onset and consolidation changes of the left lower lobe nearthe pleura in case 2 on admission; while case 3 had no abnormality on CT imaging (Figure 1).Two pediatric patients (case 1 and case 2) and their family members with SARS-CoV-2infection were admitted in Qingdao Women and Children\u2019s Hospital. During clinical practice,we noticed that the time for viral RNA in respiratory specimens turning negative was similarbetween pediatric patients and infected adults (these children\u2019s family members). At thispoint, adult patients had negative results for nucleic acid testing in fecal specimens, whereasSARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools from the two infected children. Therefore,we conducted a quarantine and surveillance protocol for the children and their familymembers who were already qualified for hospital discharge according to current standardsafter recovery with two consecutively negative RT-PCR test results in throat swabs (samplinginterval at least 1 day). Concerned about the possibility of fecal-oral transmission, werecorded the timeline of changes in nucleic acid testing results in both throat swabs and fecalsamples collected from these patients (Figure 2). All adult patients of the two familiesshowed negative results for fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Strikingly, viral RNAremained detectable in stools of the two children for 8 and 20 days, respectively, after nucleicacid turning negative in respiratory samples.We suspected whether this phenomenon also existed in the third pediatric patient (case 3)who was admitted in another designated hospital in Qingdao. Unfortunately, by the time wereached the patient, this child had already been \u201ccured\u201d and discharged. Medicalprofessionals of this hospital did not collect fecal specimens from the patient and they onlyperformed RT-PCR testing for throat swabs plus CT according to Diagnosis and TreatmentPlan of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (tentative fifth edition).16 Municipal Centre of DiseaseControl and Prevention of Qingdao conducted nucleic acid testing in stool samples collectedfrom case 3 and the child\u2019s family members 9 days after hospital discharge. This childshowed positive results for RT-PCR analysis in feces. During quarantine and follow-upperiod, clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in stool samples occurred 20 days after viral RNA inrespiratory specimens turning negative. Detailed information was not available as no fecalsample was examined during hospitalization.The newly issued report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 summarized theevidence so far on SARS-CoV-2 and pointed out 2.4% of those infected were individualsbelow 18 years of age.18 According to data released by the China Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, only 0.9% of COVID-19 patients were children under the age of 10 years.19Among the 60 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Qingdao, 3 (5%) cases were childrenyounger than 10 years of age.Most of the pediatric COVID-19 patients had mild disease with good treatment responseand a relatively short time to resolution, with exception of one critically ill case reported inWuhan.12 Consistent with previous findings, the three infected children in our study onlypresented with fever and mild cough or with no obvious symptom but CT abnormalities.From available data, children appeared to be slightly affected by SARS-CoV-2, a featureresembling that of SARS-CoV emerged 17 years ago.20 However, the relatively low attackrate of COVID-19 in children could be explained by the stringent implementation of homeconfinement and prolonged school closure during the outbreak as required by the Chinesegovernments. Whether it is also the case during school year is hard to tell. One distinctfeature of pediatric cases is that almost all of them are infected through household contactwith adult patients.9-12,21 As with all new diseases, many characteristics of COVID-19 stillremain largely unknown. There is limited data to support the notion that children are lesssusceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection or virus transmission is less effective among them.Viral RNA has been constantly detected in stool samples and anal swabs collected fromconfirmed cases of COVID-19.5,22-25 In one study, fecal specimens from 9 (53%) of 17patients were positive for nucleic acid testing, although viral loads of the stool were less thanthose of respiratory samples.24 Presence of SARS-CoV-2was even detected inenvironmental samples taken from the surface of toilet bowl and sink in infection isolationrooms.26Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in the stool of infected patients asreported by some case reports.18 Evidence so far indicates the potential for SARS-CoV-2 tobe transmitted through fecal excretion.18 Although the role of fecal shedding in viraltransmission has not been systematically determined, a cautious approach is warranted whenhandling stool samples.While we were closely monitoring the dynamic changes of fecal SARS-CoV-2 in ourpatients, a 6-year-old boy in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, was reported to beunder more than 34 days of hospitalization due to prolonged presence of viral RNA in stoolsafter showing negative in respiratory samples. Actually, this phenomenon is not rare amongpediatric patients.27 Xiao and colleagues demonstrated that about a quarter of COVID-19patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectable in feces after viral clearance in respiratory tract.25However, the researchers did not discuss whether persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 wasmore common in certain age group than the others (patient\u2019s ages ranged from 10 months to78 years in this study). Therefore, discharged patients might be a potential source oftransmission and follow-up after hospital discharge or discontinuation of quarantine isadvisable.In face of the emerging infectious disease and limited data on pediatric patients, it isunclear what role children play in SARS-CoV-2 transmission or to what extent children areaffected by the virus. More attention should be drawn to children, especially for youngchildren who cannot handle their own excretions. Caregivers of these children should avoiddirect contact with the stool and close the lid before flushing the toilet. Precautionarymeasures are needed when conducting aerosol-generating procedures and sewer systemshould be kept unobstructed. In some rural areas and underdeveloped regions with poorsanitation in China, stools are often used as natural fertilizer in agriculture. As sewage cannotbe properly disinfected in these places, it might be possible that SARS-CoV-2 polluted watercauses infection in wild animals which bring the virus back to humans, creating a viciouscycle. It is also of vital importance to implement strict hygiene measures after reopening ofkindergartens and schools to prevent spreading of the infection among preschool andschoolchildren.The limitations of this study should also be noted. In response to the emerging disease,only respiratory specimens were required for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 according toclinical guidelines in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We therefore failed to obtainstool samples from the patients during their first few days of hospitalization and could notdetermine whether throat swabs and fecal samples showed positive on RT-PCR analysissimultaneously. Moreover, we did not culture the virus isolated from the feces to test theviability nor measure viral loads in the samples due to limited conditions.Taken together, there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the current version of Diagnosis andtesting on fecal specimens should be added to the current criteria for hospital discharge andrelease of isolation. We call for multi-center studies with larger sample size to clarify thetime lag between fecal and respiratory specimens negative for RNA RT-PCR analysis ininfected children.We reported to the local health authority immediately once we noticed the persistentshedding of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of our pediatric patients about three weeks ago. When thispaper was finalized, the seventh edition of Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Corona VirusDisease 2019 had just been issued and indicated the possibility of fecal-oral transmission ofSARS-CoV-2. Currently, capable hospitals in some parts of China (such as Shanghai,Guangdong Province, and Shandong Province) have already included negative nucleic acidtesting result of fecal specimens as one of the standards for hospital discharge and release ofisolation.Q-SX had full access to all the data in the study and took responsibility for the integrity ofand the accuracy of the data.
