It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market. As these requirements remain unmet, zoonotic spillover at the market must not be overemphasized.", "text": "The clinical summary of the earliest cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections inWuhan, China was recently published [1], showing the majority of cases were exposed to the Huananseafood market, which also had wild animals, suggesting the possibility of zoonotic transmission inthe market. This suggestion of zoonotic spillover was quoted by international organizations, includingthe World Health Organization (WHO), and as a result early research focused on zoonotic rather thandirect human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. However, the index case had no exposure historyrelated to the seafood market, indicating that Huanan seafood market-related zoonotic spillover mayhave been an overblown hypothesis. Here, we reanalyze the epidemic data of the initial cluster ofcases with 2019-nCoV infections to demonstrate that the epidemic curve is consistent with substantialhuman-to-human transmission in December 2019.Three important arguments are made here with respect to epidemiological interpretation of theepidemic dataset. First, Figure 1A shows the epidemic curve of cases in Wuhan, distinguishing casegenerations by color. The index case developed symptoms on 1 December 2019, with cases 2\u20134 havingonset nine days later, and cases 5\u20136 five days after that. Together, these intervals indicate a possible serialinterval (SI)\u2014the time between illness onset in an earlier case to that in a secondary case\u2014with a meanof 7.4 days, consistent with the mean SI of severe acute respiratory syndrome [2]. The latter is alsoconsistent with the mean SI estimate of 7.5 days presented in the preliminary epidemiological study [3].J.\u00a0Clin.\u00a0Med.\u00a02020,\u00a09,\u00a0488\u00a0cases\u00a0between\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0cases.\u00a0Although it is possible that the SIs are shorter than quoted here [4], the epidemic curve is still inepidemic\u00a0 curve\u00a0 is\u00a0 still\u00a0 in\u00a0 agreement\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 existence\u00a0 of\u00a0 asymptomatic\u00a0 and\u00a0 unascertained\u00a0 mild\u00a0agreement with the existence of asymptomatic and unascertained mild cases between diagnosed cases.2\u00a0 of\u00a0 3\u00a0reprreepserenstesntths\u00a0ethien\u00a0dinedxecxa\u00a0csaes.e.(\u00a0 A(A) )T\u00a0Thheee\u00a0eppidideemmiicc\u00a0ccuurrvvee\u00a0 bbyy\u00a0 ddaattee\u00a0 ooff\u00a0 iilllnlneesss\u00a0soonnseste\u00a0t[1[]1.\u00a0]A.\u00a0Acocnostnasntta\u00a0n8\u00a0td8aydsa,\u00a0ys,coucnotuendtefdro\u00a0fmrom10\u00a010D\u00a0Deceecmembbeerr\u00a022001199,,\u00a0wwaass\u00a0uusesedd\u00a0tot\u00a0odedfienfien\u00a0tehet\u00a0hgeengeeranteiorant\u2010idoenp-ednedpeennt\u00a0dneunmt bneur\u00a0mofb\u00a0cearseosf.\u00a0(cBa)s\u00a0es.(B) TThhee\u00a0 eexxppeecctetedd\u00a0nnuummbbere\u00a0roof\u00a0fccaasesse\u00a0sinin\u00a0eeaachch\u00a0ssuubbsesqeuqeunetn\u00a0gtegneenreartiaotnio\u00a0nwaws\u00a0aassasussmuemd\u00a0etdo\u00a0tfoolfloolwlo\u00a0 wa\u00a0 PaoPisosiosns\u00a0ondistdriisbturitbiuotnio,nan,\u00a0adntdh\u00a0eth9e5\u00a09%5%co\u00a0cnofindfiednencecei\u00a0ninteterrvvaallss\u00a0ooff\u00a0tthhee\u00a0rreepprroodduuccttiioonn\u00a0nnuummbbere\u00a0r( w(whihsiksekres)r\u00a0sw) ewree\u00a0rdeedrievreidv\u00a0edfro mfrotmhe\u00a0thpero\u00a0pfirloefilliek\u00a0leilkiehloihoodo.d.\u00a0 \u00a0theemveanrtkse\u00a0 wt. ithin\u00a0the\u00a0market.\u00a0 \u00a0SecSoencdo,nads,\u00a0sausmsuimn ginag\u00a0cao\u00a0cnosntsatnatnSt\u00a0ISIo\u00a0off8\u00a08d\u00a0daayyss,,\u00a0tthhee\u00a0eeppiiddeemmiicc\u00a0ccuurrvvee\u00a0oof\u00a0fccaaseses\u00a0sbyb\u00a0ythteh\u00a0edadtae\u00a0toef\u00a0oilfl nilelnsse\u00a0ossnsoents\u00a0etcancbaen\u00a0tbraen\u00a0tsrfaonrsmfoerdmteodt\u00a0htoa\u00a0t tbhyatg\u00a0 ebnye\u00a0rgaetnioenraotifonca\u00a0soefs\u00a0.caTshees.\u00a0nTuhme\u00a0bneurmofbcear\u00a0soesf\u00a0 icnaseeasc\u00a0hing\u00a0 eenacehra\u00a0tgieonneirsatihoenr\u00a0eifso\u00a0 re1, 3t,h4e,r2e7fo,raen\u00a0d1,6\u00a0 3c,a\u00a0s4e,s\u00a0,2r7e,s\u00a0paencdt\u00a0iv6e\u00a0lyca.sTehs,e\u00a0sreesnpuemctbiveerlsy.a\u00a0llTohwesfeo\u00a0 rntuhme beesrtism\u00a0aaltlioown\u00a0 offorg\u00a0etnheer\u00a0aetsiotinm-dateiopne\u00a0nodfe\u00a0nt(Figcuarsee\u00a01fBo)r.\u00a0 Aeascshu\u00a0mgienngertahtaiotnth\u00a0e[5o]\u00a0 (sFpigriunrge\u00a0d1iBst)r.\u00a0ibAustsiuomniinsgP\u00a0otihsasto\u00a0nthdei\u00a0sotrfifbspurtiendg,\u00a0tdhiestrreipburotidounc\u00a0tiiso\u00a0nPoniusmsobne\u00a0rscandbiesterisbtiumteadt,e\u00a0 dthaet\u00a0 r3e.0pr(o9d5%uctcioonnfi\u00a0nduemncbeeirns\u00a0tcearnv\u00a0abl e(C\u00a0eIs)t:im0.7a5te,d7\u00a0.8a)t,\u00a0 31..03\u00a0 ((9955%%\u00a0 CcoIn:0fi.d4e,n3.c1e)\u00a0,in6.t7er(v9a5l%\u00a0(CCII)::\u00a040..57,59,\u00a0.6),7.8),\u00a0 1.3\u00a0 (95%\u00a0 CI:\u00a0 0.4,\u00a0 3.1),\u00a0 6.7\u00a0 (95%\u00a0 CI:\u00a0 4.5,\u00a0 9.6),\u00a0 and\u00a0 0.2\u00a0 (95%\u00a0 CI:\u00a0 0.1,\u00a0 0.5)\u2014broadly\u00a0 in\u00a0 line\u00a0 with\u00a0and 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.5)\u2014broadly in line with preliminary basic reproduction number estimates ofpreliminary\u00a0 basic\u00a0 reproduction\u00a0 number\u00a0 estimates\u00a0 of\u00a0 1.5\u20133.5\u00a0 quoted\u00a0 by\u00a0 the\u00a0 WHO\u00a0 and\u00a0 presented\u00a01.5\u20133.5 quoted by the WHO and presented elsewhere [6,7].elsewhere\u00a0[6,7].\u00a0 \u00a0Third, the common exposure supports secondary transmission events taking place in the market.Third,\u00a0 the\u00a0 common\u00a0 exposure\u00a0 supports\u00a0 secondary\u00a0 transmission\u00a0 events\u00a0 taking\u00a0 place\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0Although the virus has been identified in market environmental samples [8], this does not exclude themarket.\u00a0Although\u00a0the\u00a0virus\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0identified\u00a0in\u00a0market\u00a0environmental\u00a0samples\u00a0[8],\u00a0this\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0likelihood of secondary transmission.
