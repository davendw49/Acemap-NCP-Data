As of February 20, patientsremained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis.CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) weredeveloped on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validationdatasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- andpatients-level.The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminatingshort- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0)by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity andspecificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivityand specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset.The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy forpredicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China has become a global challengesince the December 2019.1-3 Clinical characteristics of patients with severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been reported, and the median hospitalstay of forty-seven discharged patients was 10 days.1 Studies showed that patients\u2019 condition inWuhan worsens on the 10th day after illness onset.2 However, patients with symptoms longerthan 10 days outside Wuhan were less severe than those in Wuhan.3 Therefore, the hospital stayin patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the prognostic indicators, and its non-invasivepredicting tool is important for assessing the patients\u2019 clinical outcome.Chest CT is recommended as a routine test in the diagnoses and monitoring of COVID-19since ground-glass opacities and consolidation are the most relative imaging features inpneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.4-6 On the basis of our previous workutilizing quantitative CT for COVID-19,7 we hypothesized that high-throughout informationhidden behind CT images8 had potential in discriminating the hospital stay. The study aimedto develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stayin patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.The multicenter study was conducted according to principles of the Declaration of Helsinkiand approved by all institutional review board. The need for written informed consent fromthe participants was waived. Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection andtheir initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals between January 23, 2020and February 8, 2020, with final follow-up on February 20, 2020 (Figure 1). Most patientsreceived antiviral treatment with interferon inhalation, lopinavir and ritonavir, combined withprobiotics. Patients were discharged once the results of two real-time fluorescencepolymerase-chain-reaction tests taken 24 hours apart were negative for SARS-CoV-2antigens. Patients without pneumonia findings or those remained in hospital were excluded.Sample size consideration was shown in supplementary file. In this study, the optimal cut-offvalue of hospital stay was determined to be 10 days based on previous studies1-3, by whichpatients were classified into short-term hospital stay (\u226410 days) and long-term hospital stay(>10 days).The pipeline of radiomics model was shown (Figure 1), and features extraction and modelbuilding were performed on lung lobe-level. Images preprocessing was shown insupplementary file. Images containing lesions were segmented using Python (3.6,https://www.python.org) and 3Dslicer (version 4.10.0; https://www.slicer.org/) with twosteps. First, lung lobes of each patient were segmented automatically using algorithms basedon U-net9, and results were checked and modified by one radiologist (Q.Y). Next, lesions ineach lung lobe were labeled semi-automatically using serval seeds placed within lesionregion to generate the contours. Three radiologists (S.H, Q.Y and X.P.M) evaluated segmentsof each lesion and reached a consensus. All imaging processes were blinded to clinical data.In total, 1218 features were calculated per lesion patch. First-order, shape and second-orderfeatures were extracted from original images and wavelet filter applied images usingpyradiomics.10 Two supervised learning algorithms, logistic regression (LR) and randomforest (RF), were used to build the model and verify the robustness of features(supplementary file).11 We applied 5-fold cross-validation on the training dataset to provemodel performance.The cutoff point was defined on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of trainingdata by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The model performance wasevaluated using test dataset on lung lobe-level. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC),sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value(NPV) were recorded. On patient-level, one was defined as long-term hospital stay once morethan one lesion of lung lobe was labeled as long-term stay lesion, if not, as short-termhospital stay.Categorical data were expressed in numbers (percentages), and continuous variables asmedian (interquartile range). Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients wereassessed using Chi square test (Fisher's exact test as appropriate) for categorical variables,and Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables in SPSS (version 22.0. IBM Crop. Armonk,NY, USA). Feature selection and model building were implemented with FeAture Explorer(FAE, v0.2.5, https://github.com/salan668/FAE) on Python (3.6.8, https://www.python.org/)).Test values like areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (95% confidenceinterval), sensitivity, specificity was calculated in SPSS and Python. A P-value < 0.05 wasconsidered statistically significant.This cross-sectional study did not involve patients in study design, outcome measures, orwriting or editing of this study.A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and initial CTimages were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou,and Linxia, China. As of February 20, 14 patients were still hospitalized, and 7 patients hadnon-findings in CT images. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included inthe final analysis. The training and inter-validation cohort comprised 26 patients (12 fromAnkang, 8 from Lishui, 4 from Lanzhou, and 2 from Linxia) with 59 lesion segments, andtest cohort comprised 5 patients from Zhenjiang with 13 lesion segments. The median agewas 38.00 (interquartile range, 26.00-47.00) years and 17 (57%) were male. Comorbidities,symptoms and laboratory findings at admission were summarized in Table 1.The CT radiomics model, based on 6 features (supplementary Table1), showed the highestAUC on the training and inter-validation dataset. The performance of modeling using LR andRF methods was shown in Figure 2. On lung lobe-level, models using LR methodsignificantly distinguished short- and long-term hospital stay (In training and inter-validationdatasets, cut-off value 0.31, AUC 0.94 (95%CI 0.92-0.97), sensitivity 1.0, specificity 0.87,NPV 1.0, and PPV 0.88; In test dataset, AUC 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0), sensitivity 1.0,specificity 0.89, NPV 1.0, and PPV 0.8). Besides, models using RF method obtained satisfiedresults (In training and inter-validation datasets, cut-off value 0.68, AUC 1.0 (95%CI 1.0-1.0),sensitivity 1.0, specificity 1.0, NPV 1.0, and PPV 1.0; In test dataset, AUC 0.92 (95%CI0.67-1.0), sensitivity 0.75, specificity 1.0, NPV 0.9, and PPV 1.0).On patients-level, in training and inter-validation datasets, 6 of 6 patients were correctlyclassified as short-term stay by both models, and 20 of 20, 16 of 20 patients were correctlyidentified as long-term stay by RF and LR models, respectively. In test dataset, 1 of 2 patientswas correctly classified as short-term stay, and 3 of 3 were correctly identified as long-termstay by RF and LR models.As of February 28, we followed up for a prospective dataset of 6 newly discharged patientswith 24 lesions from designated hospitals (Comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory findingswere described in supplementary Table 2). All patients were correctly recognized aslong-term stay using both RF and LR models developed on raw 52 patients.for test.In this study, machine learning-based CT radiomics models were developed and tested forpredicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.CT radiomics features hidden within lesions, ground-glass opacities and consolidation, wereextracted, and machine-learning models demonstrated robust performance using multicentercohorts for training and inter-validation, and an independent dataset and a prospective datasetThough there were slightly differences in CT scan parameters among centers, key featuresincluded in models were second-order, and focused on distribution, correlation and variancein gray level intensities, which described the relationship between voxels and holdquantitative information on the spatial heterogeneity of pneumonia lesions.11,12 Comparedwith first-order features, second-order features were not sensitive to absolute value and thusmore robust. Moreover, the models showed satisfied AUCs more than 90% on both trainingand test process, which indicated that the models could be applied in a general situation.Similarity in AUCs, sensitivity and specificity for RF and LR models also demonstrated therobustness, according to prior study that classification method showed most dominant invariability of model.11The study was limited by small sample size. The percentage of short-term hospital stay is lowin our multicenter cohorts, and semi-automated lesion segmentation might result in selectionbias. A larger prospective multicenter cohort is needed to tune and test the machinelearning-based CT radiomics models.In summary, the machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility andaccuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated withThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from Wuhan, China has become a globalchallenge since the December 2019. The median hospital stay of discharged patients withsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was reported as 10days.patients with symptoms longer than 10 days outside Wuhan were less severe than those inThe hospital stay is one of the prognostic indicators, and its non-invasive predicting modelbased on CT radiomics features is important for assessing the patients\u2019 clinical outcome.In the multicenter study with patients from 5 designated hospitals in China, the CT radiomicsmodels using logistic regression and random forest method showed satisfied diagnosticperformance with sensitivity of 1.0 and 0.75, specificity of 0.89 and 1.0, respectively, inindependent test dataset.The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy forpredicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Wang D, Hu B, Hu C, et al.
