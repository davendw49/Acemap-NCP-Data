We report the duration of viral detection in throat andrectal swabs taken from a patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) in Ho ChiMinh City, Vietnam. HTD is a referral hospital responsible for receiving and treating patientswith coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from southern Vietnam with a population of >40million.China.On January 31, 2020, a 73-year-old man with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia wasadmitted to HTD with dry cough and breathing difficulties, but without fever. He had become illwith respiratory symptoms on January 26, 2020, ten days after arrival in Vietnam from theUnited States. Whilst travelling to Vietnam, he had two hours of transit at an airport in Wuhan,Blood tests on hospital admission showed an elevation of white cells (22,9\u00d7103 cells per cubitmillimeter), but others parameters (platelet and hematocrit) were in normal ranges (data notshown). His chest radiographs obtained on admission showed bilateral infiltrates (Supplementaryand received supplemental oxygen through an oxygen mask.On February 1, 2020, a throat swab collected on admission from the patient was positive forSARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Supplementarypathogens (routine bacterial culture and influenza A/B viruses) were negative.His clinical condition improved, and from February 9th he no longer required supplementaryoxygen.

A total of 14 closecontacts were identified and followed for 14 days, but none had signs of respiratory infections,and their throat swabs collected on day 14 of quarantine were RT-PCR negative forSARS-CoVLong duration of viral detection in throat swabs by RT-PCR has been reported in a case seriesfrom China (        Collectively, our report shows the persistence of PCR positivity in throat and rectum of a patientwith COVID-19, which may potentially indicate persistent viral shedding.
