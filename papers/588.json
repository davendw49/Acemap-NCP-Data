Though the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019,SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) occurred in China first, it rapidly spread globally. Today,146 countries and territories are reporting confirmed and suspected cases ofCOVID19 [2]. Numerous etiological studies have conducted to find the detailed biologicalfeatures of COVID-19 so far. Following the global outbreak and spread of the virus,the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement on January 11, 9191,announcing the outbreak of the COVID-19 as the sixthmajor public healthemergency worldwide [3]. Thus, to prevent the spread of this new coronavirus, it isnecessary health-care staffs and decision maker, governments and the people towork together. Moreover, it is recommended that all potentially exposed subjects tobe isolated for 14 days, suggesting isolation is the best way to contain this epidemic[4].          Extracting information from basic and clinical research related to COVID-19 could becrucial for the improvement and development of the diagnosis, treatment andpreventive strategies against this viral infection. A large number of epidemiologicaland clinical evidences have emerged, and a great deal of research has beenpublished as well. Bibliometric studies is amethod of investigating scientificachievements in a particular field of science through secondary analysis of theknowledge of published articles; so, it can help researchers appreciate the earlierand existing statuses of COVID-19 efficiently, predict and choose forthcomingadvance directions, and design upcoming research [          All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.bibliometric studies on COVID-19 include inherent limitations and are rare. Due tothe rapid growth of publishing articles in this field, the aim of this article is to assessthe publication pattern of Covid-19 research globally. This study systematicallyassessed the publication distribution, stratified by geography, institution, fundingsponsors, journals, and more. We also assessed the frequency of keywords andthen employed Bibliometric mapping tools to demonstrate developments onCovid19. Results were analyzed to further understand the structure of this field and toanticipate developments on Covid-19 research. Furthermore, this study can provideinformation for funding agencies to establish elated guidelines on Covid-19 research.Sources of the Data and Search Strategy: The data in this article were based onthe Web of Science (WOS), PubMed, and Scopus from 2019 to 2020. An initialcomprehensive online search was performed on a single day, March 02, 2020, toavoid daily updating bias since the database is still open, and updated on March 10.The search key words were referred to MESH terms from PubMed and then wereused as follows: TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"Wuhan coronavirus\") ORKEY(\"Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"COVID19virus\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"COVID-19 virus\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"coronavirusdisease 2019 virus\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"SARS-CoV-2\") ORTITLE-ABSKEY(\"SARS2\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"2019-nCoV\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"2019 novelcoronavirus\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"2019 novel coronavirus infection\") ORTITLEABS-KEY(\"COVID19\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"coronavirus disease 2019\") ORTITLEABS-KEY(\"coronavirus disease-19\") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY(\"2019-nCoV disease\") ORTITLE-ABS-KEY(\"2019 novel coronavirus disease\") ORTITLE-ABS-KEY(\"2019nCoVinfection\")ORTITLE-ABS-KEY(\"covid19\") AND (LIMIT7677787980818283848586878889909192939495969798medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038752.

Bibliometric indicators were extracted from the data, including publicationnumber, citation frequency, and H index .the data were analyzed both quantitativelyand qualitatively. To adjust for economic condition and population size, statistics ongross domestic product (GDP) and population sizes from the Word Bank and theCentral Intelligence Agency for the most recent report were used in the study.Hindex is calculated as a measure of scientific research impact that reflects both thenumber of publications and the number of citations per publication: a scholar haspublished h papers, each of which has been cited in other papers at least h times.Statistical analysis: VOS viewer was used to analyze the relations among highlycited references and productive authors. It is commonly used for mapping andclustering of co citation network analysis. It also clusters citation terms and portraysthe key words by color. The density of occurrence of information is portrayed by thesize of the circle.(5)Countries Contributing to Global Publications. Initially, 227 papers wereretrieved, dating back to 2019. After an exclusion process (Figure 1), 92 studieswere selected for statistical analyses. Figure 2 shows that articles in all countriesand top three countries on Covid-19 researches.103 In terms of the most productive countries, China accounted for the highest proportionof published research (44 papers, 40.48%), followed by the United States (21papers, 19.32%), and Canada (7 papers, 6.44%). Adjusted by gross domesticproduct (GDP), ranked first, with 0.003 articles per billion GDP. Adjusted bypopulation, United States came to the fore with United States articles per millionpopulations (Table 1).Citation and H-Index Analysis. According to the analysis of the Scopus database, allarticles related to Covid-19 had been cited a total of 364 times, an average of 3.95100112 times per paper. Specifically, the top 10 Covid-19 studies (with the highest citation113 frequency) accounted for 307 citations (84.34% of 364). In terms of countries, theChina has the most citations (327) and the highest H-index (8). United States rankedsecond with 19 citations and an H-index of 2 (Table 1).Distribution of Institutes Focusing on Covid-19 research: The University of HongKong, Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Zhongnan Hospital ofWuhan University with six articles were top of the list.

Hotspots of Research on Covid-19: VOS viewer was used toanalyze keywords extracted from the titles and abstracts of 552 articles included inthis study. As a result, 84 keywords, which appeared more than 10 times, wereincluded and shown in the map. These could be stratified into three clusters:High146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038752.

For the characteristics-related research in cluster 2, the topkeywords are comprised of \u201cpatient\u201d (107 times), \u201csymptom\u201d (52 times), and\u201cyear\u201d(40 times). In cluster 3 were \u201cCountry\u201d 58 times), \u201cepidemic\u201d (49 times), and\u201csars\u201d (36 times).For analyzing data in VOS viewer, we used ISI, PubMed, and Scopus as database.The keywords were divided into three clusters: In general, the smaller the distancebetween two terms, the larger the number of co-occurrences of the terms. A largesize of a circle represents that the keyword appears more frequently. The line meansthat the topics connected on the same line are separated from each other by acomma, a semicolon, or a tab.In this study, we tried to provide an overview of the world situation in the field ofpublication of COVID-19. The results indicate that at this ISI, researchers fromaround the world started publishing the article just on month ago and the number ofarticles in this field is still growing quickly.

This Bibliometric description and mapping provided a birds-eye view of informationon Covid-19 related research for readers to comprehend the history of publishedCovid-19 articles in just a few minutes. In addition, we evaluated the researchstrength of countries and institutions, which scholars might refer to in order to findcooperative institutions. During our research using the Scopus database, we tried toguarantee comprehension and objectivity. However, we must consider the followingFirstly, only publications written in English were included this study, which, inevitably,missed some significant studies on Covid-19 published in other languages.Secondly, as the publication on COVID-19, is growing very quickly, even daily, it isvery difficult to extend the findings and generalizing the results. Thirdly, there werestill differences between real research conditions and the Bibliometric analysis214 results, since some recently published papers do not have high citation frequency,as reported by Stephan et al., in Nature [          The subject of this study was the fast growing publication on COVID-19. Moststudies are published in journals with very high impact factors (IFs) and otherjournals are more interested in this type of research. Future studies, the associationof these two topics, and related keywords will be explored to providemorecomprehensive results. In addition to the bibliometric analysis of the selecteddatabases, this study focuses solely on published sources; it is recommended thatfuture studies of published sources indatabases also be considered. Overall, since the topic of using informationtechnology in medical virology is widely considered in countries around the world, itseems necessary to provide relevant educational programs to empower medicalexperts to optimally use these tools in their professional work.253Netherlands44217665443N633222221Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virusorigins and receptor bindingClinical Characteristics of 138 HospitalizedPatients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus-InfectedPneumonia in Wuhan, ChinaNowcasting and forecasting the potentialdomestic and international spread of the2019nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: aLu, RoujianJAMAJournal of theAmericanMedicalAssociationWang, Daweiwith the MuLBSTA score, an early warning modelfor predicting mortality in viral pneumonia2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent fromSARSCoV to be considered a new human-infectingbetacoronavirus.
