According to priorreports,4,5 the ratio 1 was the ratio of agiven day\u2019s incidence over that of the daybefore. Dividing the ratio 1 of one day andthe day before resulted in ratio 2. Thepossible normality of the ratio 2 wasexamined using Skewness and Kurtosis testsafter various data transformations. Afteridentifying the best-fit data transformationformat, we examined the potential linearand log-linear associations of incidence withtime. Assuming the future ratio 1\u2019s and 2\u2019swould be the same as the mean of the pastfive dates and ratio 2\u2019s the same as themean of the last 10 days, we predicted theratio 1\u2019s and daily incidence. Statisticalanalyses were conducted using Stata(version 15) and Joinpoint (NCI). All P valueswere two-sided and a P<.05 was consideredstatistically significant. The study is exemptfrom institutional review board\u2019s reviewdue to the use of publically available andde-identified data.Results | The daily-incidence was availablefor China from January 16 to February 11,2020, for Wuhan and Hubei from January11 to February 11. Among various datatransformation formats,natural-logarithmtransformed incidence data were of normaldistribution, without significant log-linear orlinear association. The mean of ratio 2before February 8, 2020 was 0.944 (quartile0.886-1.051) for China, 0.982 (quartile0.744-1.317) for Wuhan and 0.948 (quartile0.768-1.207) for Hubei Province. The futureincidence was predicted based on the meanor quartiles of ratio 2 and subsequentlyinferred ratio 1\u2019s. The daily-incidencesignificantly decreased after February 8 inall regions, and would continue decreasinguntil reaching zero on February 25. Giventhe lower quartile (25%) of ratio 2, theincidence may reach zero by February 20,5000 China45004000y3500adre3000pce2500neied2000cnI 1500100050001/20 1/25 1/30 2/4 2/9 2/14 2/19 2/245000 Hubei Province4500400035003000250020001500100050001/15 1/20 1/25 1/30 2/4 2/9 2/14 2/19 2/24 2/29 01/15while based on the upper quartile (75%) ofratio 2, the daily-incidence will keepincreasing and reach 3000 on February 25(Figure). Hubei Province and Wuhan Cityhad a similar downward trend (Table). Theprospectively collected daily-incidence afterFebruary 8 appeared to fall in the predictedquartiles in all 3 selected regions.Discussion | Mostly using Farr\u2019s law, weestimated the quartiles of 2019-nCoVdailyincidence in China, Hubei Province andWuhan City, and predicted thedailyincidence of these regions. Our resultsimply that the daily-incidence has reachedits peak and will likely decreasecontinuously in China, Hubei Province andWuhan City, while the predicted 75% CI oftheir daily-incidence had an upward trend.Therefore, governments, healthcareproviders and residents should becautiously optimistic, and recognize thepotential upward trend of daily-incidence. Arapid growth in daily-incidence may occurwhen the residents of high-prevalenceregions, such as Hubei Province, return totheir workplaces in low-prevalence regionsat the end of Chinese New-Year holidays.Extreme caution thus should be used toprevent such an upward trend.Limitation includes possibleoversimplification of the disease\u2019s naturalhistory by this model. However, ourprospectively-collected data and recentworks proved the usefulness of the Farr\u2019slaw.5 This simple yet powerful method hasalso successfully predicted the trends inincidence of opioid overdose in the U.S.4AcknowledgementWe salute and thank our teachers,classmates and colleagues, fellow residentsand public servants, who fiercely andtirelessly fought against the novelcoronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and otherparts of China.
