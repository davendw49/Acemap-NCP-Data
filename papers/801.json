Inthis study, we have determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain(RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in complex with CR3022, a neutralizingantibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient. CR3022 targets a highlyconserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 andSARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding site can only beaccessed when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the \u201cup\u201d conformation.Overall, this study provides structural and molecular insight into the antigenicity ofStructural study of a cross-reactive SARS antibody reveals a conserved epitope on theSARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain.3738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162          The ongoing outbreak of          CR3022 was previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient and is encoded bygermline genes IGHV5-51, IGHD3-10, IGHJ6 (heavy chain), and IGKV4-1, IGKJ2 (lightchain) (4). Based on IgBlast analysis (6), the IGHV of CR3022 is 3.1% somaticallymutated at the nucleotide sequence level, which results in eight amino-acid changesfrom the germline sequence, whereas IGKV of CR3022 is 1.3% somatically mutatedresulting in three amino-acid changes from the germline sequence (fig. S1). Wetherefore determined the crystal structure of CR3022 with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD at 3.1\u00c5 resolution (table S1 and fig.S2, A and B) (7). CR3022 uses both heavy and lightchains (Fig. 1B), and all six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops (Fig. 1C)6364656667686970717273747576777879808182838485868788for interaction with the RBD. The buried surface area on the epitope is 917 \u00c52 andSARS-CoV-2 recognition by CR3022 is largely driven by hydrophobic interactions (Fig.1E). Five out of 11 somatic mutations are found in the paratope region (fig. S2C),implying their likely importance in the affinity maturation process.Out of 28 residues in the epitope (defined as residues buried by CR3022), 24 (86%) areconserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1D). This high sequenceconservation explains the cross-reactivity of CR3022. Nonetheless, despite having ahigh conservation in the epitope residues, CR3022 Fab binds to SARS-CoV RBD (Kd = 1nM) with a much higher affinity than to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Kd = 115 nM) (Table 1 andfig. S3). We postulate that the difference in binding affinity of CR3022 betweenSARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs is due to the non-conserved residues in the epitope (fig.S4). The most dramatic difference between the CR3022 epitope in SARS-CoV-2 andSARS-CoV is an additional N-glycosylation site at N370 (N357 in SARS-CoVnumbering). The N-glycan sequon (NxS/T) arises from an amino-acid difference atresidue 372, where SARS-CoV has a Thr compared to Ala in SARS-CoV-2 (fig. S4B).Mass spectrometry analysis has shown that a complex glycan is indeed present at thisN-glycosylation site in SARS-CoV (8). An N-glycan at N370 would fit into a grooveformed between heavy and light chains (fig. S4C), which could increase contact and,hence, binding affinity to CR3022. We then tested whether CR3022 was able toneutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in an in vitro microneutralization assay (7).While CR3022 could neutralize SARS-CoV, it did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at thehighest concentration tested (400 \u00b5g/mL) (fig. S5). This in vitro neutralization result isconsistent with lower affinity binding of CR3022 for SARS-CoV-2, although otherexplanations are possible as outlined below.8990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114SARS-CoV-2 uses the same host receptor, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)as SARS-CoV (3, 9-11). Interestingly, the epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with theACE2-binding site (Fig. 2A). Structural alignment of CR3022-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexwith the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex (11) further indicates that binding of CR3022would not clash with ACE2 (12). This analysis implies that the neutralization mechanismof CR3022 does not depend on direct blocking of receptor binding, which is consistentwith the observation that CR3022 does not compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD(5). Unlike CR3022, most known SARS RBD-targeted antibodies compete with ACE2 forbinding to RBD (4, 13-16). The epitopes of these antibodies are very different from thatof CR3022 (Fig. 2B). In fact, it has been shown that CR3022 can synergize with otherRBD-targeted antibodies to neutralize SARS-CoV (4). Although CR3022 itself cannotneutralize SARS-CoV-2 in this in vitro assay, whether CR3022 can synergize with otherSARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted monoclonal antibodies for neutralization remains to bedetermined.Recently, the cryo-EM structure of homotrimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined(17, 18) and demonstrated that the RBD, as in other coronaviruses (19, 20) adopts twodifferent dispositions in the trimer. The RBD can then undergo a hinge-like movement totransition between \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d conformations (Fig. 3A). ACE2 host receptor can onlyinteract with the RBD when it is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation, whereas the \u201cdown\u201dconformation is inaccessible to ACE2. Interestingly, the epitope of CR3022 is also onlyaccessible when the RBD is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, theability for CR3022 to access the RBD also depends on the relative disposition of theRBD on the adjacent protomer. CR3022 can only access RBD when the targeted RBDon one protomer of the trimer and the RBD on the adjacent protomer are both in the \u201cup\u201dconformation. The variable region of CR3022 would clash with the RBD on the adjacent115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140protomer if the latter adopts a \u201cdown\u201d conformation (Fig. 3D). As a homotrimer, the Sprotein could potentially adopt four possible RBD configurations, namely none-\u201cup\u201d,single-\u201cup\u201d, double-\u201cup\u201d, and triple-\u201cup\u201d. It appears that CR3022 can only bind to the Sprotein when it is in double-\u201cup\u201d or triple-\u201cup\u201d configuration. Specifically, one molecule ofCR3022 can be accommodated in the double-\u201cup\u201d configuration (Fig. 3E), whereas threemolecules of CR3022 could potentially be accommodated in the triple-\u201cup\u201d configuration(Fig. 3F). Previous cryo-EM studies have also shown that the recombinant SARS-CoV Sprotein is mostly found in the none-\u201cup\u201d, single-\u201cup\u201d, or double-\u201dup\u201d conformations (19,21), but rarely in the triple-\u201cup\u201d conformation, even with ACE2 receptor bound (21, 22).Together with the fact that CR3022 was isolated from a convalescent SARS patient (4),these observations suggest that an antibody response can be elicited against this crypticepitope in SARS-CoV and possibly SARS-CoV-2. Structural comparison shows that, ascompared to SARS-CoV-2, the \u201cup\u201d conformation of RBD in SARS-CoV has a largerdihedral angle to the horizontal plane of the S protein (fig. S6), suggesting that theCR3022 epitope may be slightly more accessible in SARS-CoV than in SARS-CoV-2, inthese spike ectodomain constructs. Nevertheless, the availability of this cryptic epitopeon the actual virus surface still has to be quantified to fully comprehend itsimmunological role during natural infection.Overall, our study provides insight into how SARS-CoV-2 can be targeted by thehumoral immune response and revealed a conserved, but cryptic epitope sharedbetween SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Recently, our group and others have identified aconserved epitope on influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) that is located in the trimericinterface and is only exposed through protein \u201cbreathing\u201d (23-25), which is somewhatanalogous to the epitope of CR3022. Antibodies to this influenza HA trimeric interfaceepitope do not exhibit in vitro neutralization activity but can confer in vivo protection.141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166Similarly, antibodies to another conserved epitope that partially overlaps with theinfluenza HA trimeric interface also are non-neutralizing in vitro, but protective in vivo(26). Furthermore, there are other examples of antibodies that do not have in vitroneutralization activity but confer in vivo protection, such as reported for influenza virus(27), herpesvirus (28), cytomegalovirus (29), alphavirus (30), and dengue virus (31).Therefore, although CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro despite itsreasonable binding affinity, it is possible that this epitope can confer in vivo protection.The potential existence of non-neutralizing protective antibodies to SARS-CoV-2highlights the need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 infection mouse model, which has yetto be established.Since there is currently great urgency in the efforts to develop a vaccine againstSARSCoV-2, characterizing the epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S protein is extremely valuable.Much work is now ongoing in isolating human monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2patients. We anticipate that these investigations will decipher the antigenic propertiesand major epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the molecular features that antibodiesuse for targeting neutralizing epitopes can inspire development of therapeutics, such asantiviral peptides and small molecules (32). As this coronavirus outbreak continues topose an enormous global risk (33, 34), the availability of conserved epitopes may allowstructure-based design not only of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but also for cross-protectiveantibody responses against future coronavirus epidemics and pandemics. While a moreuniversal coronavirus vaccine is not the most urgent goal at present, it is certainlyworthwhile for future consideration especially as cross-protective epitopes are identifiedso that we can be better prepared for the next novel coronavirus outbreak.REFERENCES AND NOTES167168coronavirus: synergy and coverage of escape mutants.
