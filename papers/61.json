ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus(2019nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severerespiratory syndrome. B0AT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporterwhose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9\u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex withopen and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains (PDs) ofACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediateshomodimerization. Structural modelling suggests that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex canbind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecularbasis for coronavirus recognition and infection.        The 2019-nCoV is a type of positive-stranded RNA viruses that causes severerespiratory syndrome in human. The resulting outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has emerged as a severe epidemic, claiming more than one hundred liveseveryday (                  In the case of SARS-CoV, the spike glycoprotein (S protein) on the virion surfacemediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion (3, 4). During viral maturation, thetrimeric S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits (4, 5). S1 contains the receptorbinding domain (RBD), which directly binds to ACE2 (                    Although ACE2 is known to the public because it is hijacked by coronaviruses, theprimary physiological role of ACE2, as its name indicates, is to facilitate maturation ofangiotensin, a peptide hormone that controls vasoconstriction and blood pressure.ACE2 is a type I membrane protein expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine(1315). The expression level of ACE2 is associated with cardiovascular diseases (                    The PD of ACE2 also provides the direct binding site for the S proteins of coronaviruses.Crystal structure of the claw-like ACE2-PD (21) and structures of the complex betweenPD and S protein of SARS-CoV have revealed the molecular details of the interactionbetween the RBD of S protein and PD of ACE2 (                    Recent studies show that ACE2 moonlights as the chaperone for the membranetrafficking of an amino acid transporter, B0AT1, also known as SLC6A19 (24). B0AT1mediates uptake of neutral amino acids into intestinal cells in a sodium dependentmanner. Its deficiency may cause the Hartnup disorder, an inherited disease withpellagra, cerebellar ataxia and psychosis (25-27). Structures of SLC6 members of dDAT(Drosophila Dopamine transporter) and human SERT (Serotonin transporter, SLC6A4)have been reported (          Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2-B0AT1 complexat an overall resolution of 2.9 \u00c5. The complex exists as a dimer of heterodimers. Twoconformations of the PD in the ACE2 homodimer, open and close, were extracted fromthe same dataset. Docking of the structure of the complex between ACE2-PD and theSARS-CoV S protein suggests that two S protein trimers can simultaneously bind to anThe full-length human ACE2 and B0AT1, with Strep and FLAG tags on their respectiveN-terminus, were co-expressed in HEK293F cells and purified through tandem affinityresin and size exclusion chromatography. The complex was eluted in a singlemonodisperse peak, indicating high homogeneity (Fig. 1A). Details of cryo-samplepreparation, data acquisition, and structural determination are illustrated in Materialsand Methods. Eventually, out of 418,140 selected particles, a 3D reconstruction wasobtained at an overall resolution of 2.9 \u00c5. An organization of dimer of the ACE2-B0AT1heterodimers was immediately revealed (Fig. 1B). After application of focusedrefinement and C2 symmetry expansion, the resolution of the extracellular domains wasimproved to 2.7 \u00c5, while the TM domain remains the same (Figs. 1B, SupplementaryThe high resolution supported reliable model building. For ACE2, side chains can beassigned to residues 19-768 that contain the PD (residues 19-615) and the newlyrevealed CLD consisting of a small extracellular domain, a long linker, and the singleTM (Fig. 1C). The small domain, sharing a ferredoxin-like fold, will be referred to asthe Neck domain because it connects the PD and the TM (Fig. 1C, Supplementaryby B0AT1. Both the PD and Neck domain contribute to dimerization, while each B0AT1interacts with the Neck and TM in the adjacent ACE2 (Fig. 1C). The extracellular regionis highly glycosylated, with 7 and 5 glycosylation sites on ACE2 and B0AT1,respectively.During classification, another subset with 143,857 particles was processed to an overallresolution of 4.5 \u00c5. It is apparent that while the Neck domain still dimerizes, the PDsare separated from each other in this reconstruction (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Figure1H-K). We therefore define the two classes as the open and closed conformations.Structural comparison shows that the conformational changes are achieved throughrotation of the PD domains only, with the rest of the complex nearly unchanged(Supplementary Movie 1).Dimerization of ACE2 is mainly mediated by the Neck domain, with PD contributinga minor interface (Fig. 2A). To facilitate structural illustrations, we will refer to the twoACE2 protomers A and B, with residues in protomer B labeled with \u2019. Extensive polarinteractions are mapped to the interface between N2 and N4 helices on the Neck domain(Fig. 2B). Arg652 and Arg710 in ACE2-A form cation-\uf070 interaction with Tyr641\u2019 andTyr633\u2019 from ACE2-B, respectively. Meanwhile, Arg652 and Arg710 are respectivelyhydrogen-bonded (H-bond) to Asn638\u2019 and Glu639\u2019, which simultaneously interactwith Gln653, in addition to Asn636\u2019. Ser709 and Asp713 from ACE2-A are H-bondedto Arg716\u2019. This extensive network of polar interactions indicates a stable dimerformation.The PD dimer interface appears much weaker with only one pair of interactionsbetween Gln139 and Gln175\u2019 (Fig. 2C). Note that Gln139 is positioned on a loop whichis stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys133 and Cys141 as well as multipleintroloop polar interactions (Fig. 2C). The weak interaction is consistent with the presenceof the open conformation, in which the interface between the Neck domains remainsthe same while the PDs are separated from each other by ~ 25 \u00c5 (Fig. 2D,The available structures for the complex between the SARS-CoV S protein and ACE2are limited to the isolated PD only. We next examined whether a dimeric ACE2 cansimultaneously accommodate two S protein trimers. When the S protein-PD complex(PDB code: 6ACJ) is superimposed with the PD in the closed or open states of theACE2-B0AT1 complex, the PD domains can be aligned with root mean squareddeviation of ~ 1.9 \u00c5 over ~ 550 pairs of C\uf061 atoms with the closed conformation or of ~4.9 \u00c5 over ~ 590 pairs of C\uf061 atoms with the open conformation (Fig. 3A, B,Supplementary Figure 5). In both states, S protein is positioned on the outer side ofACE2 dimer. Therefore, a dimeric ACE2 can accommodate two S protein trimers,simultaneously. This observation immediately implies potential clustering betweendimeric ACE2 and trimeric S proteins, which may be important for invagination of themembrane and endocytosis of the viral particle, a process similar to otherreceptormediated endocytosis.        Because our proteins were expressed in mammalian cells, whereas the publishedACE2PD was obtained from baculovirus-infected insect cells, more glycosylation sites, sixvs two, were observed on the surface of PD (Fig. 3C). The significance of glycosylationin the recognition between viruses and receptors has drawn increasing attention. Amongthe observed glycosylation sites on PD, three are in the vicinity of the RBD binding site(Fig. 3D). Two, Asn90 and Asn322, were observed previously (                As the PD and Neck domain are connected to the TM though an elongated linker, it islikely that the extended conformation is stabilized by B0AT1. Indeed, a close look atthe heterodimer shows extensive interface along one side of the Neck domain and TMof ACE2 with an extended TM7 and TM4 of B0AT1 (Fig. 4A), reminiscent to theinteractions between 4F2hc and LAT1 (        Compared to dDAT and other LeuT-fold transporters, TM7 of B0AT1 is particularlylong with its C-terminus extruding out of the membrane by ~ 25 \u00c5 (Supplementaryother extracellular segments of B0AT1 that participate in the complex formation withACE2. On the extracellular side, the Neck domain of ACE2 associates with theCterminal end of TM7 and the ensuing sequence of EL7-8 (extracellular loop betweenTMs 7 and 8) of B0AT1 via a number of polar or charged residues. Asn346 and Glu352of B0AT1 bind to Ser626 and Arg678 of ACE2, respectively. Asp349 of B0AT1 interactswith Lys676 of ACE2 directly and with Lys619 and Arg621 through a water molecule(Fig. 4B).Below the Neck domain, the linker is close to the EL3-4 loop of B0AT1 (SupplementaryFigure 6B). However, the density for this region is relatively weak. No specificinteractions can be identified. Further down to the membrane, the TM of ACE2 closelypacks against TM3 and TM4 of B0AT1 via van der Waals contacts throughout the heightof the lipid bilayer. At the C-terminal cytoplasmic tip of the TM, Arg768 of ACE2interacts with Glu456 on TM9 of B0AT1 to further secure the binding of the twoproteins (Fig. 4C).Although ACE2 is a chaperon for B0AT1, our focus is on ACE2 in this study. With thestabilization by B0AT1, we elucidated the structure of the full-length ACE2, whichprovides important insight into the molecular basis for viral infection by SARS-CoV aswell as 2019-nCoV.There has been no report on the oligomerization state of ACE2. Our structure revealsthe assembly of a dimer of heterodimers between ACE2 and B0AT1. B0AT1 is notinvolved in homo-dimerization, whereas the contacts between the Neck domains ofACE2 are extensive. Therefore ACE2 likely exists as a homodimer even in the absenceof B0AT1. This analysis provides immediate clue to the molecular basis for viralinfection by SARS-CoV or 2019-nCoV.        Cleavage of the S protein of SARS-CoV was reported to be facilitated by cathepsin Lin endosomes, indicating a mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis (        ACE2 with trimeric S protein suggests possible clustering that may facilitate membraneinvagination for endocytosis. Further characterizations are required to examine theinteractions between ACE2 and the viral particle as well as the effect of co-factors suchas B0AT1 and integrin on this process.        For membrane fusion, cleavage of the C-terminal segment, especially residues 697 to716 (Supplementary Figure 4), of ACE2 by proteases, such as transmembrane proteaseserine 2 (TMPRSS2), can enhance S protein-driven viral entry (        We started this work because of our serious concern with the COVID-19. Thereforethe focus of structural analysis is mainly on ACE2. In fact, B0AT1, as an importantnutrient importer, exhibits many interesting structural features that are different fromother LeuT-fold transporters. We will aim for structural determination of B0AT1 inmore conformations and present structural analysis of B0AT1 in separate studies.In summary, our structural reveals the high-resolution structures of full-length ACE2in a dimeric assembly. Modelling analysis suggests simultaneous binding of two Sprotein trimer of coronavirus to an ACE2 dimer. The structure presents here serves asan important framework to dissect the mechanism of 2019-nCoV infection and mayfacilitate development of potential therapeutics.We thank the Cryo-EM Facility and Supercomputer Center of Westlake University forproviding cryo-EM and computation support, respectively.
