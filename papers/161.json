Type II strains were likely evolved from Type I and are more prevalent than Type I among infected patients (68 Type II strains vs 29 Type I strains in total). Our results suggest the outbreak of type II COVID-19 likely occurred in the Huanan market, while the initial transmission of the type I virus to humans probably occurred at a different location in Wuhan. Second, by analyzing the three genomic sites distinguishing Type I and Type II strains, we found that the synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II straints are more prevalent, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control. The timely sharing of our findings would benefit the public health officials in making policies, diagnosis and treatments.", "text": "        The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, previously known as2019-nCoV) has been diagnosed in more than 70,000 deaths, more than 2,000 deaths,and more than 10,000 severe cases (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/global.html). Thecurrent spread trend in China is declining, but it is increasing in other countries.Therefore, it is still challenging to effectively control this ourbreak worldwide. Therecent COVID-19 virus was named as SARS-CoV-2, mainly based on its closestrelationship with the SARS-CoV virus. Our recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2and SARS-CoV have common ancestors, as they form sister groups, andSARS-CoV-2 aggregates with two SARS-like bat viruses [        We obtained 97 complete genomes of COVID-19 samples from GISAID(www.gisaid.org), NCBI and NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/#/nCov/). Sequence alignmentof 97 COVID-19 genomes plus the strain BatCoV RaTG13 used by MAFFT(https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/). Genome variable sites of Sequencealignment used the noisy (http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/noisy/). Thethree type-specific variants correspond to the genomic positions 8750, 28112, and29063, respectively; the coordinates are referred to as the sequence MN938384.1. Themaximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree used by FastTree(http://meta.microbesonline.org/fasttree/). The tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) valueswere computed using Bio::CUA (https://metacpan.org/release/Bio-CUA), and thenumbers of human tRNA genes were downloaded from http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu.We obtained 97 complete genomes of COVID-19 samples and inferred theirevolutionary relationships based on their genomic variants (Figure 1). Overall, wefound only 0 to 3 mutations among the majority of COVID-19 genomes, and there areonly 95 variable sites (Figure 1B). Their phylogenetic relationships suggest thepresence of two major types of COVID-19, namely Type I and II (Figure 1A). Thegenomes of the two types mainly differ at three sites (Figure 1B), which are 8750,28112, and 29063, based on MN938384.1\u2019s genome coordinates. Specifically, thenucleotides at the three sites are T, C, and T/C in Type I , and C, T, and C in Type II,respectively. Based on the nucleotide at the site 29063, the Type I strains can befurther divided into Type IA and IB. The number of genomes belonging to Type IA,IB and II are 10, 18, and 69, respectively. This finding suggests that the Type II strainsare dominant in the infected populations.        We found that the three sites in Type IA and two in Type IB are identical to those inthe BatCoV RaTG13 [2] (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the Type I may be more closelyrelated to the ancestral human-infecting strain than Type II, consistent with a previousreport [        To further understand the functional effects of the three variants, we examined howthese genmic variants might affect the translation of virus mRNAs in human cells.The mutations at 8750 and 29063 are synonymous (in gene orf1ab and N, repectively)and the one at 28112 is nonsynonymous, leading to a change from Leucine to Serinein the gene ORF8. Interestingly, we found that the two synonymous changes bothconfer higher translational efficiencies for the Type II strains than for the Type I ones(Figure 1C), based on the number of tRNA genes matching each codon and tRNAAdaptation Index (tAI) [6]. We speculate that the higher translational efficienciesmight have enabled faster production of Type II virus particles, facilitated its spread,and led to its becoming dominant strains, implying that Type II is more contagious(transmissible) than Type I.Our results above divided the current SARS-CoV-2 into two main types, with threesources of transmission, namely Type IA, Type IB, and Type II (Figure 2). Amongthem, Type IA is the earliest transmission source, and it did not occur in the HuananMarket, indicating that the original transmission source was not from the HuananMarket. Type II comes from the Huanan Market. As most samples detected belong toType II, we speculated that type II is the major outbreak source. It is possible thatType IA, Type IB, and Type II may lead to different patient symptoms. It would bevaluable to compare the symptoms of patients infected by different types of viruses.Recently, some asymptomatic carriers have been found [7], and it is worth to examinethe specific type of virus they infected and to determine whether the pathogenicity isdifferent among different types of SARS-CoV-2 viruses.In summary, our analyses show that there are two groups of COVID-19 viruses.Our results suggest the Huanan market is the third transmission source of the outbreak,while initial transmission of the virus to humans likely occurred at a differentlocation. With more sequencing data of 2019-nCoV, we expect a more complete oftransmission history to emerge. Our discovery suggests that patients infected with thedifferent groups of viruses may need different treatments, because the Type II oftranslation is more efficient and may lead to faster onset of illness in infected patients.Comparative studies of the symptoms of patients infected by the two types of2019-nCoVs will improve our understanding of virulent effects of the three variants.Because virus genomes are vulable for identifying their transmission sources and formonitoring the accumulation of new mutaions, we urge a more rapid sequencing andrelease of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.Acknowledgments.
