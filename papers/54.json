An angiogenic growth factor vascular endothelial growthfactor A (VEGFA) plays a crucial role in CNV pathogenesis and anti-VEGFAtherapy using humanized antibodies has been widely used in treating AMD, withthe therapeutic effects maintained by regular injections of antibodies2,3. Tworecent studies showed that in a mouse model of AMD that permanent Vegfagene disruption could be induced by SpCas9 or LbCpf1 editing4,5. However, risksassociated with permanent DNA modifications, including unwanted off-target andon-target effects, need to be considered6,7.The Cas13 protein family was recently shown to be a programmableRNAtargeting CRISPR system8-13, which could mediated RNA knockdown with highefficiency and specificity relative to other existing RNA interferenceapproaches8,9,12. Several Cas13 proteins have been identified, among whichRfxCas13d (CasRx) has the smallest size and highest RNase activity12. Here, weexamine the potential application of CasRx system for in vivo gene therapy,using a laser-induced mouse model of AMD. Our results show thatadenoassociated viral (AAV)-delivered CasRx could knockdown Vegfa transcriptsefficiently, resulting in the significant reduction of CNV area in this AMD model.We first identified two CasRx targeting sites that are conserved in the humanand mouse Vegfa gene. To achieve efficient Vegfa mRNA knockdown, two guideRNAs (gRNAs) targeting these two sites respectively were designed (Fig. 1a).We found that transient transfection of vectors expressing CasRx and the gRNAresulted in marked reduction of the Vegfa mRNA level in cultured human 293Tcells (12+/- 3.5%, s.e.m.) and mouse N2a cells (29.5 +/- 8.4%, s.e.m.) within twodays, as compared to cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 1b, c). TheVEGFA protein levels were also significantly reduced in mouse N2a cells (Fig.1d). To determine targeting specificity of CasRx, we performedtranscriptomewide RNA-seq analysis. Besides Vegfa, the expression levels of many othergenes were changed and more than half of top-ranked genes with alteredexpression were related with Vegfa according to previous studies.(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). To investigate theknockdown efficiency of CasRx in the normal mouse retina, we intravitreallyinjected AAVs encoding CasRx and a dual-gRNA array targeting Vegfa (referredas AAV-CasRx-Vegfa). Three weeks after injection, choroid-retinal pigmentepithelial (RPE) tissue complex was isolated for qPCR analysis (Fig. 1e,f). Weobserved the expression of AAV-CasRx-Vegfa (Fig. 1g) and found that Vegfatranscripts in the treated eye were potently suppressed (65.4 +/- 8.7%, s.e.m), ascompared to those in the contralateral eye injected with PBS (Fig. 1h).We next created the AMD mice by inducing CNV in both eyes by laserirradiation (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b, also see Methods). To investigate thepotential usefulness of mRNA knockdown approach for treating AMD, weinjected AAV-CasRx-Vegfa into one eye of the mouse, and PBS in the other eyeas control (Fig 1f. Induction of CNV was performed in both eyes three weekslater. After laser burn, we confirmed successful infection of AAV-CasRx-Vegfa(Supplementary Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we found that the levels of Vegfa mRNAand VEGFA protein were significantly lower in the AAV-injected eye as comparedthat those in the contralateral PBS-injected eye (mRNA, 22.7 +/- 1.8% s.e.m., p =intravitreal injection of the Vegfa mRNA-targeting AAV was efficient toknockdown VEGFA expression in the injected eye. The therapeutic effect of thisCasRX approach was assessed by quantifying the CNV area 7 days after lasertreatment. Our results showed that Vegfa-targeting AAV markedly reduced thearea of CNV at two different levels of laser irradiation, as compared to the controleyes injected with PBS (Fig. 1k,l and Supplementary Fig. 3b and 4a,b. 180 mW,66 +/- 7.8%, s.e.m., n = 6 mice, p = 0.004; 240 mW, 36.5 +/- 6.9%, s.e.m., n = 4mice, p = 0.002; unpaired t-test). Reduction of CNV was also confirmed byinjecting AAV-CasRx-Vegfa into one eye, and AAV-CasRx with no gRNA into theother eye as control (Fig. 1m and Supplementary Fig. 4c). To evaluate thepotential toxicity of AAV-CasRx-Vegfa-mediated gene knockdown, we performedelectroretinography (ERG) recording in mice at one and two months after thesubretinal injection. Our results showed that there is no significant change in theresponses in mice injected with AAV-CasRx-Vegfa compared to that in miceinjected with PBS (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). In addition, we examined theexpression level of opsin in the retina at around 1 month after AAV injection. Wefound that injection of AAV-CasRx-Vegfa did not affect the opsin-positive areas(Supplementary Fig. 5c). Together, these results suggest thatAAV-CasRxmediated Vegfa knockdown is a safe way to treat AMD.In summary, our results demonstrate that AAV-mediated delivery of CasRx canpotently knockdown Vegfa mRNA and suppress pathogenic CNV development ina mouse model of AMD, supporting the notion that RNA-targeting CRISPRsystem could be useful for therapeutic purposes. The small size of CasRx issuitable for packaging with multiple gRNAs in a single AAV vector for in vivodelivery. Notably, AAV-delivered CasRx has the potential for sustained correctiveeffects on protein expression for up to 2 years with a single injection14. The risksassociated with mRNA editing could be lower than that of DNA editing, becauseof the existence of large number of transcripts, many of which may maintainnormal functions. Thus CasRx knockdown approach could complement existingtherapeutic strategies such as monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotidesand DNA nuclease editing. Intriguingly, a recent study demonstrated that Cas13showed potent activity against RNA viruses15. In the future, it is promising toexamine whether CasRx could be used to inhibit the reproduction of recentlyemerged deadly RNA viruses such as 2019-nCoV, Ebola, MERS and Zika.Acknowledgements: We thank Drs.

Plasmids transient transfectionwas performed as previously described1. 293T and N2a cells were cultured indulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum(FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin, and maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Cellswere seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 4 \u03bcg/well vectors expressingCasRx-GFP and gRNAs-mCherry (CasRx:gRNA-1:gRNA-2 = 2:1:1, seeSupplementary sequences) using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo FisherScientific). Control group was only transfected with 2 \u03bcg/well vectors containingCasRx-GFP. GFP+mCherry+ cells (GFP+ cells for control group) were isolatedusing flow cytometry 3 days after transfection. Total RNA was first purified usingTrizol (Ambion) and then transcribed into complementary DNA (HiScript Q RTSuperMix for qPCR, Vazyme, Biotech). qPCR reactions were tracked by SYBRgreen probe (AceQ qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix, Vazyme, Biotech). ForSupplementary Fig. 3, DNA was extracted from the RPE complex and used forqPCR. VEGFA qPCR primers are: Forward, 5\u2018-GGTGGACATCTTCCAGGAGTCasRx qPCR primers are: Forward, 5\u2018- CCCTGGTGTCCGGCTCTAA-3\u2019;Reverse, 5\u2019- GGACTCGCCGAAGTACCTCT-3\u2019. For RNA-seq, around 250000GFP-positive cells were collected and lysed. Total RNAs were extracted and thenconverted to cDNA, which was used for RNA-seq. The libraries were sequencedusing Illumina Xten platform. Low-quality reads were filtered with SolexaQA(V3.1.7.1) and aligned to mm10 reference genome with Hisat2 (V2.0.4). Readcounts and differentially expressed genes were calculated using htseq-count(v0.11.2) and DEseq2 (1.24.0), respectively. Genes were treated as differentiallyexpressed genes when the fold-change > 2 and FDR < 0.05.AAV production and intravitreal injection.AAV-CasRx-Vegfa and AAV-CasRx (AAV-PHP.eb capsid2) was packaged bytransfection of HEK293T cells using Polyethylenimine (PEI) (50 \u03bcg/ml). Viruseswere harvested, purified and concentrated 3\u20137 days after transfection. Mice(C57BL/6) aged 6-8 weeks were anesthetized for intravitreal injection. Intravitrealinjection of PBS, AAV-CasRx or AAV-CasRx-Vegfa (7.5*10^9 viral genomes in 1\u03bcl) was intravitreally injected using a Hamilton syringe with a 34G needle underan Olympus microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Mice with retinal hemorrhagewere excluded.Laser-induced CNV model, CNV staining and ERGAt 2-3 weeks after AAV injection, mice were used for laser burn. CNV modelswere induced as previously described3. In brief, mice were anesthetized andpupils were dilated with dilating eye drops to enlarge the pupil size. Laserphotocoagulation was performed using NOVUS Spectra (LUMENIS). The laserparameters used in this study were: 532 nm wave length, 70 ms exposure time,240 mW power (otherwise stated) and 50 \u03bcm spot size. 4 laser burns (30 laserburns for ELISA) around the optic disc were induced. Mice with vitreoushemorrhage were excluded in the study. 3 days after laser induction, mice wereperfused with saline and RPE complexes were dissociated for ELISA analysis(qPCR was performed 7 days after laser burn). CNV analysis was conducted 7days later after laser burn. Mice were perfused with PFA and the eyes were thenfixed with PFA for 2 hours. The retina was removed from the eyes, and onlyRPE/choroid/scleral complex was stained with isolectin-B4 (IB4, 10\u03bcg/ml, I21413,Life Technologies) overnight. RPE complexes were flat-mounted and visualizedwith microscope (VS120 Olympus). Only eyes with successful AAV-CasRx-Vegfainfection were included for quantification. After obtaining CNV images, DNA wasextracted from the RPE complex, the copy number of CasRx was evaluated byqPCR. The area of CNV was quantified using ImageJ software by a blindobserver. ERG was performed as previously described4.ELISAprotocol.RPE complex were collected for ELISA. To perform VEGFA ELISA, 30 laserburns were induced in each eye 3 weeks after AAV injection. Eyes wereenucleated 3 days post-induction, the RPE complexes were dissociated from theretinas and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer. VEGFA protein levels were determinedusing Quantikine ELISA kit (MMV00\uff0cR&D SYSTEMS) according to the standardStatistical analysis. All values are shown as mean \u00b1 s.e.m.
