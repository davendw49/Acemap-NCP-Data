Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report the identicfiation and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-conrfimed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from vfie patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage uflid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we conrfimed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.", "text": "Coronaviruses have caused two large-scale pandemics in the pasttwo\u00a0decades, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)8,9.It has generally been thought that SARSr-CoV\u2014which is mainly foundin bats\u2014could cause a future disease outbreak10,11. Here we reporton a series of cases caused by an unidentified pneumonia diseaseoutbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province, central China. This diseaseoutbreak\u2014which started from a local seafood market\u2014has grownsubstantially to infect 2,761\u00a0people in China, is associated with 80\u00a0deathsand has led to the infection of 33\u00a0people in 10\u00a0additional countriesas of 26 January 202012. Typical clinical symptoms of these patientsare fever, dry cough, breathing difficulties (dyspnoea), headacheand pneumonia. Disease onset may result in progressive respiratoryfailure owing to alveolar damage (as observed by transverse chestcomputerized-tomography images) and even death. The disease wasdetermined to be caused by virus-induced pneumonia by cliniciansaccording to clinical symptoms and other criteria, including a rise inbody temperature, decreases in the number of lymphocytes and whiteblood cells (although levels of the latter were sometimes normal), newpulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography and no obviousimprovement after treatment with antibiotics for three days. It appears thatmost of the early cases had contact history with the original seafoodmarket; however, the disease has now progressed to be transmittedby human-to-human contact.Samples from seven patients with severe pneumonia (six of whom aresellers or deliverymen from the seafood market), who were admitted tothe intensive care unit of Wuhan Jin Yin-Tan Hospital at the beginningof the outbreak, were sent to the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute ofVirology (WIV) for the diagnosis of the causative pathogen (ExtendedData Table\u00a01). As a laboratory investigating CoV, we first used pan-CoVPCR primers to test these samples13, given that the outbreak occurred inwinter and in a market\u2014the same environment as SARS infections. Wefound five samples to be PCR-positive for CoVs. One sample (WIV04),collected from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), was analysed bymetagenomics analysis using next-generation sequencing to identifypotential aetiological agents. Of the 10,038,758\u00a0total reads\u2014of which1,582\u00a0total reads were retained after filtering of reads from the humangenome\u20141,378 (87.1%) sequences matched the sequence ofSARSrCoV (Fig.\u00a01a). By de\u00a0novo assembly and targeted PCR, we obtained a29,891-base-pair CoV genome that shared 79.6% sequence identityto SARS-CoV BJ01 (GenBank accession number AY278488.2). Highgenome coverage was obtained by remapping the total reads to thisgenome (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01). This sequence has been submitted toGISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) (accession number EPI_ISL_402124).Following the name given by the World Health Organization (WHO),we tentatively call it novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). Four morefull-length genome sequences of 2019-nCoV (WIV02, WIV05, WIV06 andSARSr-CoV (1,378)ORF1aWIV07) (GISAID accession numbers EPI_ISL_402127\u2013402130) that weremore than 99.9% identical to each other were subsequently obtainedfrom four additional patients using next-generation sequencing andPCR (Extended Data Table\u00a02).The virus genome consists of six major open-reading frames (ORFs)that are common to coronaviruses and a number of other accessorygenes (Fig.\u00a01b). Further analysis indicates that some of the 2019-nCoVgenes shared less than 80% nucleotide sequence identity to SARS-CoV.However, the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicasedomains in ORF1ab that were used for CoV species classification were94.4% identical between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, suggesting thatthe two viruses belong to the same species, SARSr-CoV.We then found that a short region of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase(RdRp) from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13)\u2014which was previouslydetected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province\u2014showed highsequence identity to 2019-nCoV. We carried out full-length sequencingon this RNA sample (GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_402131). Simplotanalysis showed that 2019-nCoV was highly similar throughout thegenome to RaTG13 (Fig.\u00a01c), with an overall genome sequence identityof 96.2%. Using the aligned genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, RaTG13,SARS-CoV and previously reported bat SARSr-CoVs, no evidence forrecombination events was detected in the genome of 2019-nCoV.Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome and the gene sequences ofRdRp and spike (S) showed that\u2014for all sequences\u2014RaTG13 is theclosest relative of 2019-nCoV and they form a distinct lineage from otherSARSr-CoVs (Fig.\u00a01d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02). The receptor-bindingspike protein encoded by the S gene was highly divergent from otherCoVs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a02), with less than 75% nucleotide sequenceSaccharomyces cerevisiaekiller virus M1, complete genome (52)Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirussegment C9, complete sequence (36)Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirussegment C10, complete sequence (36)Hyposoter fugitivus ichnovirussegment B5, complete sequence (24)S 3aE 6 8M 7a 7bN25,00030,000d100761001001001008586 86100identity to all previously described SARSr-CoVs, except for a 93.1%nucleotide identity to RaTG13 (Extended Data Table\u00a03). The S genes of2019-nCoV and RaTG13 are longer than other SARSr-CoVs. The majordifferences in the sequence of the S gene of 2019-nCoV are the threeshort insertions in the N-terminal domain as well as changes in four outof five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif compared withthe sequence of SARS-CoV (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03). Whether theinsertions in the N-terminal domain of the S protein of 2019-nCoV confersialic-acid-binding activity as it does in MERS-CoV needs to be furtherstudied. The close phylogenetic relationship to RaTG13 providesevidence that 2019-nCoV may have originated in bats.We rapidly developed a qPCR-based detection method on the basisof the sequence of the receptor-binding domain of the S gene, whichwas the most variable region of the genome (Fig.\u00a01c). Our data showthat the primers could differentiate 2019-nCoV from all other humancoronaviruses including bat SARSr-CoV WIV1, which shares 95% identitywith SARS-CoV (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a, b). Of the samples obtained fromthe seven patients, we found that six BALF and five oral swab sampleswere positive for 2019-nCoV during the first sampling, as assessedby qPCR and conventional PCR. However, we could no longer detectvirus-positive samples in oral swabs, anal swabs and blood samplestaken from these patients during the second sampling (Fig.\u00a02a).However, we recommend that other qPCR targets, including the RdRp orenvelope (E) genes are used for the routine detection of 2019-nCoV.On the basis of these findings, we propose that the disease could betransmitted by airborne transmission, although we cannot rule outother possible routes of transmission, as further investigation,including more patients, is required.WIV01WIV02WIV03WIV04WIV05WIV06WIV07OSASIgMIgG3.002.001.000.100.050For serological detection of 2019-nCoV, we used a previouslydeveloped nucleocapsid (N) protein from bat SARSr-CoV Rp3 as antigenfor IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), asthis protein shared 92% amino acid identity to N protein of 2019-nCoV(Extended Data Fig.\u00a05) and showed no cross-reactivity against otherhuman coronaviruses except SARSr-CoV7. We were only able to obtainfive serum samples from the seven patients with viral infections. Wemonitored viral antibody levels in one patient (ICU-06) 7, 8, 9 and18 days after the onset of disease (Extended Data Table\u00a02). A clear trendwas observed in the IgG and IgM titres, which increased over time,except that the IgM titre was decreased in the last sample (Fig.\u00a02b).As a second analysis, we tested samples from 5 of the 7 virus-positivepatients around 20 days after disease onset for the presence of viralantibodies (Extended Data Tables\u00a01, 2). All patient samples\u2014but notsamples from healthy individuals\u2014were strongly positive for viral IgG(Fig.\u00a02b). There were also three IgM-positive samples, indicating anacute infection.We next successfully isolated the virus (called 2019-nCoV BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) from both Vero E6 and Huh7 cells using the BALFsample of patient ICU-06. Clear cytopathogenic effects were observedin cells after incubation for three days (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a, b). Theidentity of the strain WIV04 was verified in Vero E6 cells byimmunofluorescence microscopy using the cross-reactive viral N antibody(Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c, d) and by metagenomics sequencing, most ofthe reads of which mapped to 2019-nCoV, and qPCR analysis showedthat the viral load increased from day\u00a01 to day\u00a03 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06e, f).Viral particles in ultrathin sections of infected cells displayed atypical coronavirus morphology, as visualized by electron microscopy(Extended Data Fig.\u00a06g). To further confirm the neutralization activityof the viral IgG-positive samples, we conducted serum-neutralizationassays in Vero E6 cells using the five patient sera that were IgG-positive.We demonstrate that all samples were able to neutralize 100 TCID50ELISA OD ratios for IgM and IgG, respectively. c, Serological test of 2019-nCoVantibodies in five patients (Extended Data Table\u00a02). The asterisk indicates datacollected from patient ICU-06 on 10 January 2020. b, c, The cut-off was to 0.2for the IgM analysis and to 0.3 for the IgG analysis, according to the levels ofhealthy controls.(50% tissue-culture-infective dose) of 2019-nCoV at a dilution of1:40\u20131:80. We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized byhorse anti-SARS-CoV serum (gift from L.-F. Wang) at dilutions of 1:40;however, the potential for cross-reactivity with SARS-CoVantibodies needs to be confirmed with anti-SARS-CoV serum from humans(Extended Data Table\u00a04).ACE2 is known to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV14. To determinewhether 2019-nCoV also uses ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor, weconducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells that expressed ordid not express ACE2 proteins from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats,civets, pigs and mice. We show that 2019-nCoV is able to use all ACE2proteins, except for mouse ACE2, as an entry receptor to enterACE2expressing cells, but not cells that did not express ACE2, indicating thatACE2 is probably the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters cells(Fig.\u00a03). We also show that 2019-nCoV does not use other coronavirusreceptors, such as aminopeptidase N (APN) and dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07).The study provides a detailed report on 2019-nCoV, the likelyaetiological agent responsible for the ongoing epidemic of acute respiratorysyndrome in China and other countries. Virus-specificnucleotidepositive and viral-protein seroconversion was observed in all patientstested and provides evidence of an association between the disease andthe presence of this virus. However, there are still many urgentquestions that remain to be answered. The association between 2019-nCoVand the disease has not been verified by animal experiments to fulfilthe Koch\u2019s postulates to establish a causative relationship between amicroorganism and a disease. We do not yet know the transmissionroutine of this virus among hosts. It appears that the virus isbecoming more transmissible between humans. We should closely monitorwhether the virus continues to evolve to become more virulent. Owingto a shortage of specific treatments and considering the relatedness of2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV, some drugs and pre-clinical vaccines against2ECAh2ECAb2ECAs2ECAc2ECAmdetcefsnartnUSARS-CoV could probably be used to treat this virus. Finally,considering the wide spread of SARSr-CoV in their natural reservoirs, futureresearch should be focused on active surveillance of these virusesfor broader geographical regions. In the long term, broad-spectrumantiviral drugs and vaccines should be prepared for emerginginfectious diseases that are caused by this cluster of viruses in the future.Most importantly, strict regulations against the domestication andconsumption of wildlife should be implemented.Note added in proof: Since this paper was accepted, the ICTV hasdesignated the virus as SARS-CoV-215; in addition, the WHO has released theofficial name of the disease caused by this virus, which is COVID-1916.Online contentAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reportingsummaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information,acknowledgements, peer review information; details of authorcontributions and competing interests; and statements of data and codeavailability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7.Publisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims inpublished maps and institutional affiliations.Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distributionand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriatecredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license,and indicate if changes were made.

Theexperiments were not randomized and the investigators were notblinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.Sample collectionHuman samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs, blood and BALFsamples were collected by Jinyintan hospital (Wuhan, China) withthe consent of all patients and approved by the ethics committee ofthe designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Patientswere sampled without gender or age preference unless indicated.For swabs, 1.5\u00a0ml DMEM containing 2% FBS was added to each tube.The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 2,500\u00a0rpm,vortexing for 60\u00a0s and a standing period of 15\u201330\u00a0min. Thesupernatant from swabs or BALF (no pre-treatment) was added to either lysisbuffer for RNA extraction or to viral transport medium for isolationof the virus. The viral transport medium was composed of Hank\u2019sbalanced salt solution (pH\u00a07.4) containing BSA (1%), amphotericin(15\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml \u22121), penicillin G (100\u00a0units\u00a0ml\u22121) and streptomycin (50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml \u22121).Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3,000g for 15\u00a0min within24\u00a0h of collection, followed by inactivation at 56\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, and wasthen stored at 4\u2009\u00b0C until use.Virus isolation, cell infection, electron microscopy andneutralization assayThe following cell lines were used for virus isolation in this study: VeroE6 and Huh7 cells, which were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Allcell lines were tested and free of mycoplasma contamination, submittedfor species identification and authenticated by morphologicalevaluation by microscopy. None of the cell lines was on the list of commonlymisidentified cell lines (by ICLAC).Culturedcellmonolayersweremaintainedintheirrespectivemedium.The PCR-positive BALF sample from ICU-06 patient was spun at 8,000gfor 15\u00a0min, filtered and diluted 1:2 with DMEM supplemented with16\u00a0g\u03bc\u00a0ml \u22121 trypsin before it was added to the cells. After incubation at37\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh culturemedium containing antibiotics (see below) and 16\u00a0g\u03bc\u00a0ml \u22121 trypsin. Thecells were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C and observed daily for cytopathogeniceffects. The culture supernatant was examined for the presence of virusby qRT\u2013PCR methods developed in this study, and cells were examinedby immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-SARSr-CoV Rp3 Nantibodythatwasgeneratedin-house(1:1,000).Penicillin(100\u00a0units\u00a0ml\u22121)and streptomycin (15\u00a0g\u03bc\u00a0ml \u22121) were included in all tissue culture media.Vero E6 cells were infected with the new virus at a multiplicity ofinfection (MOI) of 0.5 and collected 48\u00a0h after infection. Cells were fixedwith 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydratedthrough a graded series of ethanol concentrations (from 30 to 100%)and embedded with epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (80\u00a0nm) ofembedded cells were prepared, deposited onto Formvar-coated copper grids(200\u00a0mesh), stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and analysedusing a 200-kV Tecnai G2 electron microscope.The virus neutralization test was carried out in a 96-well plate.The patient serum samples were heat-inactivated by incubation at56\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h before use. The serum samples were diluted to 1:10, 1:20,1:40 or 1:80, and then an equal volume of virus stock was added andincubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 60\u00a0min in a 5% CO2 incubator. Diluted horseanti-SARS-CoV serum or serum samples from healthy individualswere used as control. After incubation, 100\u00a0\u03bcl mixtures were inoculated onto a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate for 1\u00a0h. Eachserum was assessed in triplicate. After removing the supernatant, theplate was washed twice with DMEM medium. Cells were incubatedwith DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 3\u00a0days. Subsequently,the cells were checked for cytopathogenic effects.RNA extraction and PCRWhenever commercial kits were used, the manufacturer\u2019s instructionswere followed without modification. RNA was extracted from 200\u00a0\u03bclof samples with the High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche). RNA was eluted in50\u00a0\u03bcl of elution buffer and used as the template for RT\u2013PCR.For qPCR analysis, primers based on the S gene of 2019-nCoV weredesigned: RBD-qF1, 5\u2032-CAATGGTTTAACAGGCACAGG-3\u2032; RBD-qR1,5\u2032-CTCAAGTGTCTGTGGATCACG-3\u2032. RNA extracted as describedabove was used for qPCR using the HiScript II One Step qRT\u2013PCRSYBR Green Kit (Vazyme Biotech). Conventional PCRs were alsoperformed using the following primer pairs: ND-CoVs-951F,5\u2032-TGTKAGRTTYCCTAAYATTAC-3\u2032; ND-CoVs-1805R,5\u2032-ACATCYTGATANARAACAGC-3\u2032. The 20-\u03bcl qPCR reaction mix contained 10\u00a0\u03bcl 2\u00d7 OneStep SYBR Green mix, 1\u00a0\u03bcl One Step SYBR Green Enzyme mix, 0.4\u00a0\u03bcl50\u00d7 ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.4\u00a0\u03bcl of each primer (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and 2\u00a0\u03bcltemplate RNA. Amplification was performed as follows: 50\u2009\u00b0C for3\u00a0min, 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s followed by 40\u00a0cycles consisting of 95\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u00a0sand 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s, and a default melting curve step in an ABI 7500Real-time PCR machine.Serological testIn-house anti-SARSr-CoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits were developed usingSARSr-CoV Rp3 N protein as antigen, which shared more than 90%amino acid identity to all SARSr-CoVs2. For IgG analyses, MaxiSorpNunc-immuno 96-well ELISA plates were coated (100\u00a0ng per well)overnight with recombinant N protein. Human sera were used at a dilutionof 1:20 for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. An anti-human IgG HRP-conjugated monoclonalantibody (Kyab Biotech) was used at a dilution of 1:40,000. The ODvalue (450\u2013630\u00a0nm) was calculated. For IgM analyses, MaxiSorpNuncimmuno 96-well ELISA plates were coated (500\u00a0ng per well) overnightwith anti-human IgM (\u03bc chain). Human sera were used at a 1:100dilution for 40\u00a0min at 37\u2009\u00b0C, followed by incubation with an anti-Rp3 NHRP-conjugated antibody (Kyab Biotech) at a dilution of 1:4,000. TheOD value (450\u2013630\u00a0nm) was calculated.Examination of ACE2 receptor for 2019-nCoV infectionHeLacellstransientlyexpressingACE2werepreparedusingLipofectamine3000(ThermoFisherScientific)ina96-wellplate;mock-transfectedcellswere used as controls. 2019-nCoV grown in Vero E6 cells was used forinfection at a MOI of 0.5. APN and DPP4 were analysed in the same way.The inoculum was removed after absorption for 1\u00a0h and washed twicewith PBS and supplemented with medium. At 24\u00a0h after infection, cellswere washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH\u00a07.4)for 20\u00a0min at room temperature. ACE2 expression was detected usinga mouse anti-S tag monoclonal antibody and a FITC-labelled goatantimouse IgG H&L (Abcam, ab96879). Viral replication was detected usingarabbitantibodyagainsttheRp3Nprotein(generatedin-house,1:1,000)andaCy3-conjugatedgoatanti-rabbitIgG(1:200,Abcam,ab6939).Nucleiwere stained with DAPI (Beyotime). Staining patterns wereexaminedusingconfocalmicroscopyonaFV1200microscope(Olympus).High-throughput sequencing, pathogen screening and genomeassemblySamples from patient BALF or from the supernatant of viruscultures were used for RNA extraction and next-generation sequencing(NGS) using BGI MGISEQ2000 and Illumina MiSeq 3000 sequencers.Metagenomic analysis was carried out mainly based on thebioinformatics platform MGmapper (PE_2.24 and SE_2.24). The rawNGS reads were first processed by Cutadapt (v.1.18) with minimumread length of 30\u00a0base pairs. BWA (v.0.7.12-r1039) was used to alignreads to a local database with a filter hits parameter of 0.8\u00a0FMM((match\u00a0+\u00a0mismatch)/read length\u00a0\u2265\u00a0fraction] value and minimumalignment score of 30. Parameters for post-processing of assignedreads were set to a minimum size normalized abundance of 0.01,minimum read count of 20 and were otherwise set to defaultparameters. A local nucleic acid database for human and mammals was Data availabilityused to filter reads of host genomes before mapping reads to the Sequence data that support the findings of this study have beendeposvirus database. The results of the metagenomic analysis were dis- ited in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) with accession numbersplayed as pie charts using Microsoft Office 2010.

As a laboratory investigating CoV, we first used pan-CoVPCR primers to test these samples13, given that the outbreak occurred inwinter and in a market\u2014the same environment as SARS infections. Four morefull-length genome sequences of 2019-nCoV (WIV02, WIV05, WIV06 andSARSr-CoV (1,378)ORF1aWIV07) (GISAID accession numbers EPI_ISL_402127\u2013402130) that weremore than 99.9% identical to each other were subsequently obtainedfrom four additional patients using next-generation sequencing andPCR (Extended Data Table\u00a02).The virus genome consists of six major open-reading frames (ORFs)that are common to coronaviruses and a number of other accessorygenes (Fig. We were only able to obtainfive serum samples from the seven patients with viral infections. 2b).As a second analysis, we tested samples from 5 of the 7 virus-positivepatients around 20 days after disease onset for the presence of viralantibodies (Extended Data Tables\u00a01, 2). b, c, The cut-off was to 0.2for the IgM analysis and to 0.3 for the IgG analysis, according to the levels ofhealthy controls.(50% tissue-culture-infective dose) of 2019-nCoV at a dilution of1:40\u20131:80. We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized byhorse anti-SARS-CoV serum (gift from L.-F. Wang) at dilutions of 1:40;however, the potential for cross-reactivity with SARS-CoVantibodies needs to be confirmed with anti-SARS-CoV serum from humans(Extended Data Table\u00a04).ACE2 is known to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV14. However, there are still many urgentquestions that remain to be answered. It appears that the virus isbecoming more transmissible between humans. Most importantly, strict regulations against the domestication andconsumption of wildlife should be implemented. Theexperiments were not randomized and the investigators were notblinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Patientswere sampled without gender or age preference unless indicated. For swabs, 1.5\u00a0ml DMEM containing 2% FBS was added to each tube. Thecells were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C and observed daily for cytopathogeniceffects. The virus neutralization test was carried out in a 96-well plate. After incubation, 100\u00a0\u03bcl mixtures were inoculated onto a monolayer of Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate for 1\u00a0h. Eachserum was assessed in triplicate.
