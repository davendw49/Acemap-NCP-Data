Knowing whether mind-body therapies may benefit patients treated with opioids for acute, procedural, and chronic pain conditions may be useful for prescribers, payers, policy makers, and patients. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association of MBTs with pain and opioid dose reduction in a diverse adult population with clinical pain. DATA SOURCES For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews from date of inception to March 2018. Search logic included (pain OR analgesia OR opioids) AND mind-body therapies. The gray literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, and relevant bibliographies were also searched. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials that evaluated the use of MBTs for symptom management in adults also prescribed opioids for clinical pain. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted using standardized mean differences in pain and opioid dose to obtain aggregate estimates of effect size with 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was pain intensity. The secondary outcomes were opioid dose, opioid misuse, opioid craving, disability, or function. RESULTS Of 4212 citations reviewed, 60 reports with 6404 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, MBTs were associated with pain reduction (Cohen d = \u22120.51; 95% CI, \u22120.76 to \u22120.26) and reduced opioid dose (Cohen d = \u22120.26; 95% CI, \u22120.44 to \u22120.08). Studies tested meditation (n = 5), hypnosis (n = 25), relaxation (n = 14), guided imagery (n = 7), therapeutic suggestion (n = 6), and cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 7) interventions. Moderate to large effect size improvements in pain outcomes were found for meditation (Cohen d = \u22120.70), hypnosis (Cohen d = \u22120.54), suggestion (Cohen d = \u22120.68), and cognitive behavioral therapy (Cohen d = \u22120.43) but not for other MBTs. Although most meditation (n = 4 [80%]), cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 4 [57%]), and hypnosis (n = 12 [63%]) studies found improved opioid-related outcomes, fewer studies of suggestion, guided imagery, and relaxation reported such improvements. Most MBT studies used active or placebo controls and were judged to be at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest that MBTs are associated with moderate improvements in pain and small reductions in opioid dose and may be associated with therapeutic benefits for opioid-related problems, such as opioid craving and misuse. Future studies should carefully quantify opioid dosing variables to determine the association of mind-body therapies with opioid-related outcomes.", "type": "Original Investigation", "text": "T gency at both clinical and policy levels. For much of thehe opioid crisis is being addressed with heightenedur20th century, opioids were prescribed primarily forpostoperative and cancer-related pain.1 In the 1990s, prescriptionof opioids to treat all forms of pain became standard care.1Consequently, opioid prescriptions increased to 208 million by2011.1 Currently, more than 35% of the US adult population isprescribed opioids in a given year.2 This marked increase inopioid prescriptions was paralleled by an increasing incidence ofopioid use disorder (OUD), which now affects approximately2 million individuals in the United States,3 and opioidmisuse, which affects 12 million individuals in the United Statesoverall.2 Since 2006, US deaths due to opioid overdose havetripled, increasing to 42 200 in 2016,4 and are projected to reach82 000 by 2025, resulting in 700 000 additional deaths in theUnited States.5The opioid c risis arose in part bec ause ofwellintentioned efforts to alleviate untreated pain. Althoughopioids are considered to be useful in managing a widecontinuum of pain, including acute, procedural, and chronic pain,evidence of their long-term efficacy and safety is limited.6 Tohelp combat the opioid crisis, guidelines encouragepractitioners to consider nonopioid pain management options,including mind-body therapies (MBTs).7 Mind-body therapiestarget \u201cinteractions among the brain, mind, body, andbehavior, with the intent to use the mind to affect physicalfunctioning and promote health.\u201d8 Mind-body therapies mightameliorate pain and prevent downstream transitions fromlongterm opioid use to OUD. Thus, the National Institutes of Healthinitiative Helping to End Addiction in the Long Term (HEAL)has called for studies of MBTs as interventions for painand OUD.The efficacy of MBTs should be examined across the paincontinuum. Reviews9-14 demonstrate that MBTs may beassociated with significantly alleviated clinical pain. Few of thestudies reviewed measured opioid use, and reviews includedpatients who were not prescribed opioids. However, noreview, to date, has examined the efficacy of MBTs specificallyfor the subset of patients prescribed opioid analgesics. Giventhe importance of this population, we provide, to ourknowledge, the first systematic review of MBTs for opioid-treatedpain. Because of the urgency of the opioid crisis, wereviewed all studies of MBTs for patients with opioid-treated painregardless of the study quality or clinical population toprovide comprehensive evidence to prescribers, patients,payers, and policy makers.7For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the followingbibliographic databases were searched for English-languagerandomized clinical trials and systematic reviews from the dateof inception to March 2018: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL,Emcare, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Library.

Studies wereexcluded if they collected data on pain medicine or analgesicswithout specifying that these medications were opioids.To constrain the considerable heterogeneity of MBTs, welimited our review to studies of psychologically oriented MBTsthat prioritize using mental techniques to ameliorate pain,including meditation, hypnosis, guided imagery, relaxation,therapeutic suggestion, and cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT). Meditation involves practices, such as mindfulness, tocultivate present-moment focused attention andmetaawareness, as well as acceptance of thoughts, emotions, andbody sensations.16 Hypnosis involves induction of an alteredstate of consciousness in which focused attention andreduced peripheral awareness enhance the capacity forresponding to suggestions for changing thoughts, emotions, andsensations.17 Guided imagery involves active imagination ofvisual, auditory, and somatic sensations and perceptions.18Relaxation involves the use of the mind to systematicallyrelease muscle tension throughout the body.19 Therapeuticsuggestion involves provision of suggestions to change thoughts,emotions, and sensations without directly inducing anhypnotic altered state.20 Cognitive behavioral therapy involves theuse of logic to challenge and change negative thinkingpatterns, thereby decreasing negative emotions and promotingadaptive behaviors.21Although acupuncture and spinal manipulation aresometimes labeled MBTs, given that these approaches rely onphysical (eg, needling and musculoskeletal adjustment) rather thanpsychological techniques, we did not include studies of thesetherapies in our review. Similarly, studies of yoga or Tai Chiwithout formal meditation practice were excluded. Weincluded studies of physical mind-body modalities or othercomplementary therapies only if 50% or more of theintervention involved delivery of psychologically oriented MBTtechniques. We elected to focus our review on MBTs thatprimarily use mental techniques because they may be more accessibleto people whose mobility is compromised by pain or used forpain relief during inpatient procedures when patients areimmobilized.The primary outcome was pain severity or intensity.Secondary outcomes were opioid use measured by prescriptionrecord, self-report, or urine toxicologic screening; opioid misuseand craving; and disability or functional impairment.Abstracts and full texts were screened and data extractedindependently by 2 reviewers (E.L.G., C.E.B., A.W.H., E.J.R.,R.M.A., S.A.G., K.R.F., J.Y., and/or M.F.) via Covidence (https://www.covidence.org/home). Risk of bias was assessed inCovidence using the Cochrane risk of bias tool by 2 independentreviewers (E.L.G., C.E.B., A.W.H., E.J.R., R.M.A., S.A.G., K.R.F., J.Y., and/or M.F.). Disagreements were resolved by a thirdreviewer (E.L.G., C.E.B., A.W.H., E.J.R., R.M.A., S.A.G., K.R.F., J.Y., or M.F.) or by discussion. To prevent conflict of interest,studies written by review authors were assessed by othermembers of the author team.Mixed-effects meta-analyses were performed using the RMetafor package22 for pain and opioid dose outcomes. Aftersending email requests for missing data to authors of studiesincluded in the review who did not provide sufficient data inthe original publication, 29 studies19,23-50 were included in thepain meta-analysis and 8 studies29,30,35,37-39,42,43 in theopioid dose meta-analysis. In studies with more than 1 MBT arm,data from both MBTs were included. Studies that reported Pvalues but did not report numerical means and SDs forbaseline or postintervention pain or opioid use could not beincluded in the meta-analysis. Pain values were standardizedusing a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale, and opioid dosewas standardized into morphine equivalents using standardequianalgesic conversion tables.7 Change scores werecreated by subtracting the baseline value from the mostproximal postintervention end point; this end point was selectedbecause it was consistently collected despite great variabilityin time points across studies. The SDs of the change scores wereimputed via Cochrane best practices.51 Effect size estimateswere calculated as standardized mean differences.22 Studyheterogeneity was investigated using Baujat plots inconjunction with the Q and I2 statistics.52,53 Publication bias wasexamined with funnel plots and the Egger test.53,54 Although weperformed quantitative meta-analyses on all studies for whichwe could extract data, the entire body of studies wassystematically reviewed in a qualitative manner (summary studydata19,23-50,55-86 are presented in Table 1 and detailed study datain the eMethods in the Supplement).We screened 4212 citations and 603 full-text articles. Sixtystudies with a total of 6404 participants were ultimately includedin the review (Figure 1). The 60 studies focused on variousclinical pain targets: procedural pain (n = 39), burn pain (n = 7),cancer pain (n = 5), chronic pain (n = 8), or heterogeneous acutepain conditions (n = 1).

Inspection of Baujat plots(eFigure 6 in the Supplement) revealed that 2 studies,23,24 bothof which demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in favor ofMBTs, were appropriate for removal as outliers: 1 in the painmeta-analysis and 1 in the opioid use meta-analysis. We choseto remove those studies to obtain stable and reliablemetaanalytic effect size estimates per best practice guidelines.87Pain-Related Outcome ResultsOverall, MBTs had a significant, moderate association withreduced pain (Cohen d = \u22120.51; 95% CI, \u22120.76 to \u22120.27; P < .001)(Figure 2A). Computation of the Q (\u03c72 = 287.21, P < .001) andI2 (90.53%) statistics showed some heterogeneity of effect sizes.These data were derived from 29 studies (n = 2916), with 1679patients receiving an MBT. A funnel plot (eFigure 7 in theSupplement) and the Egger statistic (z = \u22120.65, P = .52) did notindicate publication bias.Opioid-Related Outcome ResultsOverall, MBTs had a significant, small association withopioid use (Cohen d = \u22120.26; 95% CI, \u22120.44 to \u22120.08; P = .01)(Figure 2B). Computation of the Q (\u03c72 = 6.70, P = .82) and I2(0.0%) statistics showed homogeneity of effect sizes. Thesedata were derived from 8 distinct studies (n = 435), with 250patients receiving an MBT. A funnel plot (eFigure 8 in theSupplement) and the Egger statistic (z = \u22120.30, P = .76) did notindicate publication bias.To our knowledge, this study represents the first systematicevaluation of the therapeutic benefits of MBTs foropioidtreated clinical pain in studies including more than 6000patients. Overall meta-analytic results revealed that MBTs hada statistically significant, moderate association with reducedpain intensity and a statistically significant, small associationwith reduced opioid dosing compared with a range of controlarms. The strength of the evidence for the therapeutic effectsof MBTs on pain and opioid dose reduction was moderate,although this evidence varied by specific MBT. Taken togetherwith descriptive results from this systematic review, MBTsoverall may be associated with improved pain andopioidrelated outcomes for a variety of painful health conditions.Most studies used active or placebo controls and had low riskof bias (Figure 3 and eFigures 9-14 in the Supplement),increasing confidence that the reported benefits are not solelythe result of nonspecific therapeutic factors.From a more granular perspective, differences emergedregarding the efficacy of the specific types of MBTs studied.Most studies of meditation, hypnosis, and CBT reportedsignificant therapeutic associations with opioid-relatedoutcomes, including opioid dosing, craving, and opioid misuse,whereas comparatively fewer studies of suggestion,imagery, and relaxation reported significant associations withopioid-related outcomes. Of note, 2 studies37,74 reportedsignificantly worsened opioid dosing outcomes afterrelaxation, suggesting the possibility of adverse effects.However, few studies reported adverse effects or harms of MBTs.Because of insufficient statistical power from the paucity ofstudies reporting opioid dose data, we could not conductseparate meta-analyses for each type of MBT on opioiddosing.A different pattern emerged with regard to painoutcomes. Separate meta-analyses by specific MBT typedemonstrated significant associations of meditation, hypnosis, CBT,and suggestion with pain outcomes, with the largest effect sizesobserved for meditation studies. Differences in therapeuticefficacy between MBTs could be ascertained through rigorouscomparative effectiveness trials. Although several of thestudies26,29,39,70-72 in this review compared 2 MBTs, they werenot sufficiently powered to detect what are likely to be smalleffect size differences between bona fide treatments.Furthermore, many of the MBTs reviewed involved combinations ofapproaches, including some with CBT. Dismantling trials couldunpack multimodal MBTs and determine the differentialeffects of their various treatment components.Differences also emerged with regard to foci of MBTclinical pain targets. Most of the meditation-based interventionstudies focused on treating chronic noncancer pain (eg, low backpain). In contrast, most hypnosis, relaxation, imagery, andsuggestion studies focused on treating acute, procedural, orcancerrelated pain. It is plausible that MBTs have differentialassociations with acute vs chronic pain as well as opioid use dependingon their mechanisms of action. In that regard, mindfulnesstraining aims to increase acceptance, decrease catastrophizing, andfacilitate a shift from affective to sensory processing of painsensations by reappraising pain as innocuous sensoryinformation rather than an emotionally laden threat to bodily integrity.88These mechanisms might be especially efficacious for chronicpain conditions in which pain exacerbation occurs through thedevelopment of cognitive schemas, attentional hypervigilance,E10JAMA Internal Medicine Published online November 4, 2019 (Reprinted)and distress intolerance. In contrast, techniques such ashypnosis and guided imagery aim to reduce pain throughdissociation or imaginal superimposition of pleasurable sensations ontothe painful body part.89 These mechanisms might instead beefficacious for acute pain conditions or procedural pain wherenociceptive peripheral or visceral afference during noxiousstimulation causes suffering. However, mindfulness andhypnosis appear to help alleviate pain via corticothalamicmoducedural pain, they may serve as an important form of primaryprelation of ascending nociceptive input.90-93 Additional studiesvention of long-term opioid use and OUD.

The observed findings onopioids for a range of pain conditions, MBTs may help alleviateprocedural pain are especially notable; if MBTs can reduceprothe opioid crisis.E12jamainternalmedicine.comThis study has limitations. We could not draw quantitativeconclusions about outcome modifiers, such as dose ordelivery format, or about durability of treatment effects becauseof high levels of study heterogeneity. Outcomes rangedfrom immediate postintervention acute pain outcomes tooutcomes that lasted 3 months or longer. Approximatelyone-third of studies had small samples and therefore mayhave been underpowered. Although most studies had lowrisk of bias, a number of trials had biases, such as lack ofblinding of participants, personnel, and/or outcomesassessors, and lack of intention-to-treat analysis. Given thatnearly approximately half of the trials reviewed wereconducted before publication of the revised CONSORTstatement in 2001,95 some studies were missing clinical trialreporting information. Funnel plots and the Egger statisticindicated some publication bias for meditation andsuggestion studies.Another limitation was the insufficient reporting of opioiddosing in the MBT literature. A number of studies, includinghigh-impact trials,96 could not be included because the type ofanalgesic was unspecified and/or outcomes for opioid users werenot analyzed separately. Of the trials reviewed, less thanonefifth yielded opioid dosing data of sufficient detail to bemetaanalyzed.The findings suggest that MBTs are associated withmoderate improvements in pain and small reductions in opioiddose and may be associated with therapeutic benefits foropioid-related problems, such as opioid craving and misuse.Future studies should carefully quantify opioid dosingvariables to determine the association of mind-body therapieswith opioid-related outcomes.ARTICLE INFORMATIONAccepted for Publication: August 29, 2019.Published Online: November 4, 2019.doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.4917and Boston University School of Medicine, Boston,(Atchley); Independent consultant, Halifax, NovaConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Garlandreported serving as the director of the Center onMindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement(MORE), mindfulness-based therapy, and cognitivebehavioral therapy in the context of research trialsfor no cost to research participants; receivinghonoraria and payment for delivering seminars,lectures, and teaching engagements (related totraining practitioners in MORE and mindfulness)sponsored by institutions of higher education,government agencies, academic teaching hospitals,and medical centers; and receiving royalties fromthe sale of books related to MORE during theconduct of the study Dr Keefe reported a patentpending.
