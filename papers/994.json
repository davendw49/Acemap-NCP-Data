Onestudy from Vanderbilt found coronavirus in about 5% ofsamples from upper respiratory illness and 8% from lowerrespiratory illness [                Two events changed that picture: the discovery of MiddleEastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the explosiveoutbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [                As is well known, SARS causes a highly fatal infection inhumans. Research on the latter virus concluded that SARS islikely a virus with a reservoir in bats [                Nature frequently repeats itself, and a new coronavirus,named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has escaped froma market in the city of Wuhan in central China and is spreadingfrom there. Although mortality seems to be lower than in thecase of SARS, many of the infections cause lower respiratorytract disease requiring hospitalization. Although yet to beconfirmed at this writing, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2originated from infections transferred from small mammals in theWuhan market to humans. In any case, it is now spreadingby human-to-human contact. Respiratory secretions ofinfected individuals contain virus, and there is some evidencethat virus may be excreted in stool. Obviously, muchinformation is unpublished but is being exchanged through theWorld Health Organization (WHO) and websites. Sequencesof SARS-CoV-2 show 82% homology with SARS and there issome cross-neutralization by SARS antiserum againstSARSCoV-2, but probably not enough to be useful in protectinghuman populations [                Information about the new virus is evolving rapidly, aslaboratories throughout the world are working hard on it. Amongthe critical questions\u00a0are:1. How to grow the virus? (It does grow in some cell cultures.)2. Are antibodies to the virus protective or enhancing?3. What animal models can be used to study the virus?4. Do antibodies to SARS or MERS protect against SARS-CoV-2?Novel Coronavirus \u2022 jpids5. What is the best vaccine antigen: whole virus, spike protein,or receptor-binding domain of the spike protein?6. Can large amounts of a vaccine be made before next winter,assuming that SARS-CoV-2 becomes a seasonal threat?For obvious reasons, a single-dose vaccine would bepreferable to a vaccine requiring several doses. The current focus isto develop antibodies to the spike surface protein and inparticular to the receptor-binding domain on that protein. Themost obvious platforms to develop single-dose vaccines areattenuated viruses, DNA plasmids, and messenger RNAconstructs coding for viral proteins that stimulate neutralizingantibodies. However, subunit protein vaccines are also beingdeveloped. The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes thatnew agents will emerge from time to time to threaten humansand that mechanisms of rapid response should be in placebeforehand. That was the reason CEPI was developed and,indeed, CEPI and the WHO together are marshalinglargescale preventive and therapeutic responses to the new virus[        Aside from the development of vaccines againstSARSCoV-2, a step the Chinese government should take is to banthe sale of small mammals in their markets to prevent theintroduction of other coronaviruses or, for that matter, pathogens ingeneral that could adapt to humans.NotePotential coniflcts of interest. \u00a0 Dr. Plotkin consults for many vaccinemanufacturers and biotechnology organizations. eTh author has submittedthe ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.
