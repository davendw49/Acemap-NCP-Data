No infectious virus couldbe detected after a 30-minute incubation at 56\uf0b0C or a 5-minute incubation at 70\uf0b0C.We further investigated the stability of this virus on different surfaces at RT. In brief, a5\u00b5L droplet of virus culture (\uf07e7.8 Log unit of TCID50/mL) was pipetted on a small surface (Table B;\uf07e1 cm2 per piece). The inoculated objects were retrieved at various time points and each objectwas then immediately soaked with 200 \u00b5L of VTM for 30 minutes at RT to elute the virus. Forprinting and tissue papers, no infectious virus could be recovered from these surfaces after a3hour incubation. No infectious virus from treated cloth and stainless steel could be recovered onDays 2 and 7, respectively. Strikingly, a significant level of infectious virus could still be detectedon the outer layer of a surgical mask on Day 7 (\uf07e0.1% of the original inoculum), indicatingSARSCoV-2 is extremely stable on this surface. Representative negative eluents recovered from eachsurface were tested positive by RT-PCR3 (N=39; data not shown).We also tested the virucidal effects of disinfectants by adding 15 \u00b5L of SARS-CoV-2 culture(\uf07e7.8 Log unit of TCID50/mL) to 135 \u00b5L of various disinfectants at working concentration (TableC). With the exception of a 5-min incubation with hand soap, no infectious virus could bedetected after a 5-minute incubation at RT.Overall, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly stable in a favourable environment, but it is also susceptibleto standard disinfection methods.We declare that we have no competing interests.
