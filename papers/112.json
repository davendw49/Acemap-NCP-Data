Previous studies indicated that some ofthose bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report theidentification and characterization of a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) whichcaused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans, in Wuhan, China.The epidemic, started from December 12th, 2019, has caused 198 laboratoryconfirmed infections with three fatal cases by January 20th, 2020. Full-lengthgenome sequences were obtained from five patients at the early stage of theoutbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequenceidentify to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96%identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise proteinsequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins show that this virusbelongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. The nCoV-2019 virus was then isolatedfrom the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, which can beneutralized by sera from several patients. Importantly, we have confirmed thatthis novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV.Coronavirus has caused two large-scale pandemic in the last two decades, SARS andMERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome)8,9. It was generally believed thatSARSrCoV, mainly found in bats, might cause future disease outbreak10,11. Here we reporton a series of unidentified pneumonia disease outbreaks in Wuhan, Hubei province,central China (Extended Data Figure 1). Started from a local fresh seafood market, theepidemic has resulted in 198 laboratory confirmed cases with three death according toauthorities so far12. Typical clinical symptoms of these patients are fever, dry cough,4849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970dyspnea, headache, and pneumonia. Disease onset may result in progressiverespiratory failure due to alveolar damage and even death. The disease wasdetermined as viral induced pneumonia by clinicians according to clinical symptomsand other criteria including body temperature rising, lymphocytes and white bloodcells decreasing (sometimes normal for the later), new pulmonary infiltrates on chestradiography, and no obvious improvement upon three days antibiotics treatment. Itappears most of the early cases had contact history with the original seafood market,and no large scale of human-to-human transmission was observed so far.Samples from seven patients with severe pneumonia (six are seafood market peddlersor delivers), who were enrolled in intensive unit cares at the beginning of the outbreak,were sent to WIV laboratory for pathogen diagnosis (Extended Data Table 1). As aCoV lab, we first used pan-CoV PCR primers to test these samples13, considering theoutbreak happened in winter and in a market, same environment as SARS. We foundfive PCR positive. A sample (WIV04) collected from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF) was analysed by metagenomics analysis using next-generation sequencing(NGS) to identify potential etiological agents. Of the 1582 total reads obtained afterhuman genome filtering, 1378 (87.1%) matched sequences of SARSr-CoV (Fig. 1a).By de novo assembly and targeted PCR, we obtained a 29,891-bp CoV genome thatshared 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV BJ01 (GenBank accession numberAY278488.2). This sequence has been submitted to GISAID (accession no.EPI_ISL_402124). Following the name by WHO, we tentatively call it novelcoronavirus 2019 (nCoV-2019). Four more full-length genome sequences ofnCoV7273747576777879808182838485868788899091929394EPI_ISL_402127-402130) that were above 99.9% identical to each other weresubsequently obtained from other four patients (Extended Data Table 2).The virus genome consists of six major open reading frames (ORFs) common tocoronaviruses and a number of other accessory genes (Fig. 1b). Further analysisindicates that some of the nCoV-2019 genes shared less than 80% nt sequenceidentity to SARS-CoV. However, the seven conserved replicase domains in ORF1abthat were used for CoV species classification, are 94.6% aa sequence identicalbetween nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV, implying the two belong to same species(Extended Data Table 3).We then found a short RdRp region from a bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13which we previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province showedhigh sequence identity to nCoV-2019. We did full-length sequencing to this RNAsample. Simplot analysis showed that nCoV-2019 was highly similar throughout thegenome to RaTG13 (Fig. 1c), with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity. Thephylogenetic analysis also showed that RaTG13 is the closest relative of thenCoV2019 and form a distinct lineage from other SARSr-CoVs (Fig. 1d). The receptorbinding protein spike (S) gene was highly divergent to other CoVs (Extended DataFigure 2), with less than 75% nt sequence identity to all previously describedSARSrCoVs except a 93.1% nt identity to RaTG13 (Extended Data Table 3). The S genes ofnCoV-2019 and RaTG13 S gene are longer than other SARSr-CoVs. The majordifferences in nCoV-2019 are the three short insertions in the N-terminal domain, andfour out of five key residues changes in the receptor-binding motif, in comparison96979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118with SARS-CoV (Extended Data Figure 3). The close phylogenetic relationship toRaTG13 provides evidence for a bat origin of nCoV-2019.We rapidly developed a qPCR detection based on the receptor-binding domain ofspike gene, the most variable region among genome (Fig. 1c). Our data show theprimers could differentiate nCoV-2019 with all other human coronaviruses includingbat SARSr-CoV WIV1, which is 95% identity to SARS-CoV (Extended Data Figure4a and 4b). From the seven patients, we found nCoV-2019 positive in six BALF andfive oral swab samples during the first sampling by qPCR and conventional PCR(Extended Data Figure 4c). However, we can no longer find viral positive in oralswabs, anal swabs, and blood from these patients during the second sampling (Fig.2a). Based on these findings, we conclude that the disease should be transmittedthrough airway, yet we can\u2019t rule out other possibilities if the investigation extendedto include more patients.For serological detection of nCoV-2019, we used previously developed batSARSrCoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein (NP) as antigen in IgG and IgM ELISA test, whichshowed no cross-reactivity against other human coronaviruses except SARSr-CoV7.As a research lab, we were only able to get five serum samples from the seven viralinfected patients. We monitored viral antibody levels in one patient (ICU-06) at seven,eight, nine, and eighteen days after disease onset (Extended Data Table 2). A cleartrend of IgG and IgM titre (decreased at the last day) increase was observed (Fig. 2b).For a second investigation, we tested viral antibody for five of the seven viral positivepatients around twenty days after disease onset (Extended Data Table 1 and 2). Allpatient samples, but not samples from healthy people, showed strong viral IgGpositive (Fig. 2b). We also found three IgM positive, indicating acute infection.We then successfully isolated the virus (named nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019), in Vero and Huh7 cells using BALF sample fromICU-06 patient. Clear cytopathogenic effects were observed in cells after three daysincubation (Extended Data Figure 5a and 5b). The identity of the strain WIV04 wasverified in Vero E6 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using cross-reactiveviral NP antibody (Extended Data Figure 5c and 5d), and by metagenomic sequencing,from which most of the reads mapped to nCoV-2019 (Extended Data Figure 5e and5f). Viral partials in ultrathin sections of infected cells displayed typical coronavirusmorphology under electron microscopy (Fig. 3). To further confirm the neutralizationactivity of the viral IgG positive samples, we conducted serum-neutralization assaysin Vero E6 cells using the five IgG positive patient sera. We demonstrate that allsamples were able to neutralize 120 TCID50 nCoV-2019 at a dilution of 1:40-1:80.We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized by horse anti-SARS-CoVserum at dilutions 1:80, further confirming the relationship of the two viruses(Extended Data Table 4).Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was known as cell receptor forSARSCoV14. To determine whether nCoV-2019 also use ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor,we conducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells expressing or not expressingACE2 proteins from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, pig, and mouse. Weshow that nCoV-2019 is able to use all but mouse ACE2 as an entry receptor in theACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2, indicating which is likely the cellreceptor of nCoV-2019 (Fig. 4). We also proved that nCoV-2019 does not use othercoronavirus receptors, aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Extended DataFigure 6).The study provides the first detailed report on nCoV-2019, the likely etiology agentresponsible for ongoing acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Wuhan, central China.Viral specific nucleotide positive and viral protein seroconversion observed in allpatients tested provides evidence of an association between the disease and thepresence of this virus. However, there are still many urgent questions to be answered.We need more clinical data and samples to confirm if this virus is indeed the etiologyagent for this epidemic. In addition, we still don\u2019t know if this virus continue evolvingand become more transmissible between human-to-human. Moreover, we don\u2019t knowthe transmission routine of this virus among hosts yet. We showed viral positive inoral swabs, implying nCoV-2019 may be transmitted through airway. However, thisneeds to be confirmed by extending detection range. Finally, based on our results, itshould be expected and worth to test if ACE2 targeting or SARS-CoV targeting drugscan be used for nCoV-2019 patients. At this stage, we know very little about the virus,including basic biology, animal source or any specific treatment. The almost identicalsequences of this virus in different patients imply a probably recent introduction inhumans, thus future surveillance on viral mutation and transmission ability andfurther global research attention are urgently needed.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: We thank the Pei Zhang and An-na Du from WIV corefacility and technical support for their help with producing TEM micrographs.

Thefollowing cells were used for virus isolation in this study: Vero, Vero E6, and Huh7that were cultured in DMEM +10% FBS. A list of cells were used for susceptibilitytest (Extended Data Fig. 6). All cell lines were tested free of mycoplasmacontamination, applied to species identification and authenticated by microscopicmorphologic evaluation. None of cell lines was on the list of commonly misidentifiedcell lines (by ICLAC).Cultured cell monolayers were maintained in their respective medium. PCR-positiveBALF sample from ICU-06 patient was spin at 8,000 g for 15 min, filtered anddiluted 1:2 with DMEM supplied with 16 \u03bcg/ml trypsin before adding to cells. Afterincubation at 37 0C for 1 h, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh culturemedium containing antibiotics (below) and 16 \u03bcg/ml trypsin. The cells were incubatedat 37 0C and observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). The culture supernatant wasexamined for presence of virus by qRT-PCR developed in this study, and cells wereexamined by immunofluorescent using SARSr-CoV Rp3 NP antibody made in house(1:100). Penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (15 \u03bcg/ml) were included in alltissue culture media.The Vero E6 cells were infected with new virus at MOI of 0.5 and harvested 48 hpi.Cells were fixed with 2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide, andthen dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol concentrations (from 30 to 100%),and embedded with epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) of embedded cells wereprepared, deposited onto Formvar-coated copper grids (200 mesh), stained withuranyl acetate and lead citrate, then observed under 200 kV Tecnai G2 electronmicroscope.The virus neutralization test was carried out in a 48-well plate. The patient serumsamples were heat-inactivated by incubation at 56 0C for 30 min before use. Theserum samples (5 \u00b5L) were diluted to 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 or 1:80, and then an equalvolume of virus stock was added and incubated at 37 0C for 60 min in a 5% CO2incubator. Diluted horse anti SARS-CoV serum or serum samples from healthypeople were used as control. After incubation, 100 \u00b5L mixtures were inoculated ontomonolayer Vero E6 cells in a 48-well plate for 1 hour. Each serum were repeatedtriplicate. After removing the supernatant, the plate was washed twice with DMEMmedium. Cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 24 hours.Then the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde.

For IgG test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 well ELISA platesExamination of ACE2 receptor for nCoV-2019 infection. HeLa cells transientlyexpressing ACE2 were prepared by a lipofectamine 3000 system (Thermo FisherScientific) in 96-well plate, with mock-transfected cells as controls. nCoV-2019grown from Vero E6 cells was used for infection at multiplicity of infection 0.05.Same for testing of APN and DPP4. The inoculum was removed after 1 h absorptionand washed twice with PBS and supplemented with medium. At 24 hpi, cells werewashed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min atroom temperature. ACE2 expression was detected using mouse anti-S tag monoclonalantibody followed by FITC-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG H&L (Abcam, ab96879).Viral replication was detected using rabbit antibody against the Rp3 NP protein (madein house, 1:100) followed by cyanin 3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50, Abcam,ab6939). Nucleus was stained with DAPI (Beyotime). Staining patterns wereexamined using the FV1200 confocal microscopy (Olympus).High throughput sequencing, pathogen screening and genome assembly. Samplesfrom patient BALF or from virus culture supernatant were used for RNA extractionand next-generation sequencing using Illumina MiSeq 3000 sequencer. Metagenomicanalysis was carried out mainly base on the bioinformatics platform MGmapper(PE_2.24 and SE_2.24). The raw NGS reads were firstly processed by Cutadapt(v1.18) with minimum read length of 30bp. BWA (v0.7.12-r1039) was utilized toalign reads to local database with a filter hits parameter at 0.8 FMM value andminimum alignment score at 30. Parameters for post-processing of assigned reads wasset with minimum size normalized abundance at 0.01, minimum read count at 20 andother default parameters. A local nucleic acid database for human and mammals wasemployed to filter reads of host genomes before mapping reads to virus database. Theresults of metagenomic analysis were displayed through pie charts using WPS Office2010. NGS reads were assembled into genomes using Geneious (v11.0.3) andMEGAHIT (v1.2.9). PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed to fill gaps in thegenome. 5\u2019-RACE was performed to determine the 5\u2019-end of the genomes usingSMARTer RACE 5\u2019/3\u2019 Kit (Takara). Genomes were annotated using Clone ManagerProfessional Suite 8 (Sci-Ed Software).Phylogenetic analysis. Routine sequence management and analysis was carried outusing DNAStar. Sequence alignment and editing were conducted using ClustalW andGeneDoc. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees based on nucleotide sequences offull-length ORF1b and S genes were constructed using the Jukes-Cantor model withbootstrap values determined by 1000 replicates in the MEGA6 software package.Data Availability statement.

Allpatient samples, but not samples from healthy people, showed strong viral IgGpositive (Fig. We demonstrate that allsamples were able to neutralize 120 TCID50 nCoV-2019 at a dilution of 1:40-1:80.We also show that this virus could be cross-neutralized by horse anti-SARS-CoVserum at dilutions 1:80, further confirming the relationship of the two viruses(Extended Data Table 4).Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was known as cell receptor forSARSCoV14. However, there are still many urgent questions to be answered. In addition, we still don\u2019t know if this virus continue evolvingand become more transmissible between human-to-human.

Patients were sampled without gender or age preference unless whereindicated. Supernatant was collected after 2500 rpm, 60 s vortex and 15-30 min standing. VTMcomposed of Hank's balanced salt solution at pH7.4 containing BSA (1%),amphotericin (15 \u03bcg/ml), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/ml).Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 15 min within 24 h of collection,followed by 56 0C 30 min inactivation, and then stored at 4 0C until use. The virus neutralization test was carried out in a 48-well plate. After incubation, 100 \u00b5L mixtures were inoculated ontomonolayer Vero E6 cells in a 48-well plate for 1 hour. Cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 24 hours. For IgG test, MaxiSorp Nunc-immuno 96 well ELISA platesExamination of ACE2 receptor for nCoV-2019 infection. The inoculum was removed after 1 h absorptionand washed twice with PBS and supplemented with medium. Staining patterns wereexamined using the FV1200 confocal microscopy (Olympus).High throughput sequencing, pathogen screening and genome assembly. 5\u2019-RACE was performed to determine the 5\u2019-end of the genomes usingSMARTer RACE 5\u2019/3\u2019 Kit (Takara)."}
