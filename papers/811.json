The primer set seems to have been adapted already by many researchers worldwide and contributed for the high-quality and prompt genome epidemiology of this potential pandemic virus. We have also seen the great performance of their primer set and protocol; the primer set was able to amplify all desired PCR products with fairy small amplification bias from clinical samples with relatively high viral load. However, we observed acute drop of reads derived from two particular PCR products, 18 and 76, out of the 98 designated products as sample's viral load decreases. We suspected the reason for this low coverage issue was due to dimer formation between primers used to amplify those two PCR products. Here, we propose replacing just one of those primers, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT(-), to a newly designed primer. The result of the replacement of primer showed improvement in coverage at both regions targeted by the products, 18 and 76. We expect this simple modification will extend the limit for whole SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis to samples with lower viral load and enhance genomic epidemiology of this pathogen.", "text": "        The spreading of the novel corona virus, SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for therespiratory illness, COVID-19, starting from December 2019 has become a huge concern inthe medical community around the world. In modern epidemiology, it is important to capturevariations in genome sequence among isolates of such outbreaking pathogens for monitoringpathogen\u2019s evolution or tracking epidemiological chains in local to even global scale.Relatively large genome of the corona virus (approx. 30 kb), however, makes it challengingto reconstruct whole genome of the virus from samples with various viral loads incosteffective manner. Recently, a group of molecular biologists which is called ARTIC Network(https://artic.network/) proposed 98 multiplexing PCR primer pairs        We have already tested the ARTIC primer set and their protocol for several clinical samples,mostly RNA from pharyngeal swab, and observed a great performance of their primer set.Actually, the primer set works quite well for samples with relatively high viral load (Ct < 25 inclinical qPCR test). For such high viral load samples, all designated products are amplifiedwithin acceptable level of coverage bias for subsequent NGS analysis. The approach ofARTIC Network is expected to save resources and scale to a number of samples with a givenNGS sequencing capacity, which will be crucial for large epidemic situation being concernedin many countries. As sample\u2019s viral load decreases, however, gradual increase of the entirecoverage bias was observed with their protocol. Although such phenomenon is normallyexpected in multiplex PCR for low-copy templates, we observed that coverages for the twoparticular PCR products, 18 and 76, which correspond to the genomic regions coding for thensp3 in ORF1a and S protein, respectively, decays far more rapidly than other products (eachupper half of Fig1A and B). In our experience so far, low to absolute-zero depth for those twofragments tends to be most frequent bottle neck for completion of all targeted genomicregions from samples with middle to low viral load (Ct > 27). This low coverage issue at theproducts 18 and 76 are also seen in data published from other groups (e.g.https://cadde.s3.climb.ac.uk/covid-19/BR1.sorted.bam).In ARTIC primes set, the PCR products, 18 and 76, are amplified by the primer pairsnCoV2019_18_LEFT(+) and nCoV-2019_RIGHT(-) and nCoV-2019_76_LEFT(+) andnCoV2019_RIGHT(-), respectively, which are included in the same multiplex reaction \u201cpool_2\u201d. Wenoticed that two of those primers, nCoV-2019_18_LEFT(+) and nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT(-)are perfectly complement to each other by their 10-nt sequence at the 3\u2019-end (Fig 2). Fromthis observation, we reasoned that the rapid decrease of the amplification efficiencies ofthose PCR products was due to a primer dimer formation between nCoV-2019_18_LEFT(+)and nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT(-), that could complete to the intended amplification reactions.Indeed, we observed many NGS reads derived from the predicted dimer in raw FASTQ data(data not shown).Then, we replaced one of those \u2018unlucky\u2019 primer pair, nCoV-2019_76_RIGHT(-), in the pool_2to a newly designed 2019_76_RIGHTv2(-) (Table 1) which locates at 48-nt downstream tonCoV-2019_76_RIGHT(-).Comparison of original and new primer set for 8 clinical samples with Ct-values rangingfrom 25 to 30 are shown in Fig 3. The replacement certainly added notable improvement inread depths at the regions covered by the products 18 and 76 (Fig 3 and upper half of eachFig 1A and B as an example). There was no notable adverse effect observed in other PCRproducts by this replacement of a primer.
