We calculate the exponential growth of the mosta ected countries, showing the evolution along time after the rst local case. Weidentify clearly di erent patterns in the analyzed data and we give interpretationsand possible explanations for them. The analysis and conclusions of our study canhelp countries that, after importing some cases, are not yet in the local spreadingphase, or have just started.All the provinces of China show very similar epidemic behaviour.Early stages of spreading can be explained in terms of SIR standardmodel, considering that reported cases accounts for the removedindividuals, with algebraic growing (sub-exponential) in most locations.Worldwide, we observe two classes of epidemic growth: sub-exponentialduring almost all stages (China and Japan) and exponential on the restof the countries, following the early stage.The exponential growth rates ranges from 0.016day 1 (South Korea) to0.725day 1 (Brunei) which means 1.6% to 107% of new cases per day,for the di erent countries but China.        The COVID-19 pandemic [        The disease has already spread to more than 140 other countries |and islikely to reach all countries| thus, understanding its behavior is a priority.In Fig. 1 we see the evolution of the cases detected with the virus in Chinaand the rest of the world, with clearly very di erent trends. As China hasasymptotically reached 81,000 cases, the sum of cases from all other countrieshas exceeded that number on March 15th, 2020, after 55 days of the rst caseoutside of China.As local outbreaks are still in the early stages in most countries,identifying and analyzing the propagation patterns in countries with a considerablenumber of cases is crucial in helping others prepare, anticipate and, hopefully,avoid the overload point of each national health system.recorded day at JHU, Jan 22nd, until March 15th, 2020.        The infection from the COVID-19 virus produces u symptoms in mostcases, with an asymptomatic but potentially infecting phase. [        I()I;(1)R(t)) e(1at + bt2where I and S are the density of infected an susceptible, respectively. Thesolution of Eq. (1) has the form I(t) I(0)e( )t. In this framework,therefore, an exponential growing phase is expected with growth rate r = ,from where the infectiousness parameter or the basic reproductive numberR0 could be derived, if we know the recovery rate .Such behavior of the number of infected happens only when there is nointervention at all. Also, it refers to the number of infected of a given epidemic,which is in general unknown. However, in the ongoing pandemic ofCOVID19, there is a continuous, daily account of the number of con rmed cases,worldwide. And the identi ed individuals, after tested positive for the Coronavirus, are then isolated or set to quarantine, i.e., they are removed from thedynamics. They actually account for the R compartment, which is governedinstead by the di erential equation ddRt = I, with early-stage solution:I(0) )t(where a = I(0) and b = I(0)( )=2.Based on the above arguments, in the next Section, we analyse the timeseries of the 32 provinces/regions of China, assuming that the increase of casesis of algebraic type. However, we do not force the t to the expression (2), wet with a N = atb relation instead, and obtain the resulting exponents. Thetting of the power-law is made in a moving window of seven days, and plotthe b exponent as a function of day for the whole time series, starting at dayone for each province and ending on March 12th (as March 15th is the lastday considered in this study and each value correspond to the center of the 7days window).For the international outbreak, we rst applied the parabolic tting ofEq. (2) to three countries (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and compare themwith China (Fig. 2). After that, we dismiss the algebraic tting and use the(2)exponential growth (I (t)I(0)e()t = AeBt), from Eq. (1), instead.Consequently, we t an exponential function in a moving window of seven daysand plot the B growth rate as a function of day for the whole time series.Before delving into more speci c analysis, we rst observe in Fig. 2 theresults of the algebraic t R(t)at + bt2 in comparison with the real data forfour di erent countries: China, Italy, Japan and Germany.in four countries. From top left to bottom right, in Italy, Japan, China andGermany since Feb 21th or the rst outbreak day (for China) and thecorresponding algebraic tting R(t)at + bt2 compatible with early-time expansionof the unconstrained SIR model, see Eq. (2)The patterns observed in Fig. 2 suggest that di erent models should beapplied according to the country that is being analysed. Clearly, Italy andGermany deviate from the algebraic behavior and become exponential afterabout 15 days from the outbreak, signaling the substantial delay with respectto China and Japan of the implementation of containment strategies. For thatreason, we divided the analysis: for China 1 we focused on the sub-exponentialmodel; for the other countries, we focused on the exponential t.We start by presenting in Fig. 3 the coe cient b of the tted law Cases = atbfor Chinese provinces. The tting of the algebraic sub-exponential epidemicgrowth cover the period from Jan 22nd |the rst day of data| to Feb 11th,2020.tb, from day 1 to Feb 11th forthe 32 provinces/regions of China.As we can see in Fig. 3, the algebraic tting provides consistent values in allprovinces/regions, with exponent between 1 and 2, as stated by Eq. 2. This is1 While the parabola, according to Eq. 2, t very well the early stages of China data,an exponential t for a very shot period is valid too. However, in the long term, theexponential has to change its growth rate continuously as the algebraic is better forlonger periods.compatible with the hypothesis of the removing population represented by therecorded number of cases. Moreover, the fast isolation of infectives (turningthem into removed, indeed), means increasing the rate , so e ectively loweringthe basic reproductive number Ro.Then, the power-law tting is extended thorough a moving window of sevendays, covering the period from Jan 22nd to March 15th, 2020. The results ofthe ts, for each of the province/regions of China, are shown in Fig. 4.tb, as a function of days afteroutbreak, based on 7 days moving window, for all the Chinese provinces. FromJan 22nd to March 15th, 2020.The following general characteristics are evident: there is a peak (some caseswith exponent b3), mainly in the rst two weeks after the local outbreak,then a clear and continuous decrease in the exponent of the algebraic tting.The slowing down to b0 is almost general, except for two locations: Gansu,with a late peak, and Hong Kong, where the epidemic seems to be bouncingup. Therefore, the epidemic is not fully contained even when total numbers(all China) do not show that so clearly. Those peaks at di erent times indi erent regions may indicate the epidemic arriving later or national measuresimplemented later. It is also important to stress that the peaks are of theexponents. As the growth rate for a power law regime ntb isn=n = b=t,an exponent 3 at day 30 gives a growth rate of 10%, while an exponent 2 atday 10 represents a growth rate of 20%. Regardless of that, the general trendof algebraic tting, with most exponents going most zero, is a clear indicationof a coordinated e ort.For the international outbreak, we make the seven day moving windowanalysis, but using the exponential growth I(t))t = eBt. We thenplot in Fig. 5 the B rate as a function of day, for all the countries that havemore than 500 cases on March 15th, 2020. Even when we have shown in theprevious section that the data from China is well represented by an algebraicfunction, we include an exponential tting of the same data for comparisonwith the other countries.local outbreak, evaluated on a moving window of 7 days, for the countries withmore than 500 cases on March 15th, 2020.The Fig. 5 allows us to see the di erent behaviors of the COVID-19spreading in those countries. Apart from some particular cases |most distinctiveChina but South Korea, Japan, and maybe Iran too| the rest seem to t inone of two patterns, which we show in detail in Fig. 6. Either they have adormant phase (mostly imported cases with no local infections), followed bythe onset of the exponential local spreading inside the country (Fig. 6b), orthey skip the dormant phase and enter the exponential phase almostimmediately (Fig. 6c). The last behaviour occurs for many European countries thathave delayed the arriving of infected cases and are still facing the rst weeksof the outbreak. They are lowering the growth rate, apparently in a steadyway, but the growth rate0:3 are still high, which means a doubling time ofless than 2.5 days.1020 Daysafteroutbreak304050than 500 cases) countries by March 15th, 2020, From day one of each countryuntil March 15th, 2020. Short scales (c) are due to countries with morerecent outbreaks. (b) and (c) are displayed from day 15 and 20 respectively tohighlight the more recent data.The four countries displayed in Fig. 6a have the most distinctive behaviorfrom the rest. The common denominator is the steady lowering of the growthrate coe cient. But the paths to the lowering are di erent between them.While for China is very clear, except for two small bumps in the third, andseventh week, due to delayed burst in some regions (see Fig. 4), South Koreaand Japan show a more erratic pattern, oscillating around the 0:1 untilrecently, when South Korea nally managed to plunge its rate, following nowthe Chinese pattern. Iran, in turn, has not reached yet the 0:1 mark, but hasbeen consistently lowering its rate since the beginning of cases, although itmight be to soon to see if it is de nitely going down. Finally, although Japanhas managed to have less than 10% daily rate, it seems to struggle yet to lowereven more its rate.Figure 6d shows the data on the growth rate of the US and the UK. Theybelong to the same group as displayed in Fig. 6b, but we decided to separatefor the sake of clarity and show together with Germany as an example of (b)group. We see that they are at high values after a rebound in a qualitativelysame pattern as Germany. The di erence in the case of the UK and US isthat they had more uctuations (not seen in the panel) before the clear onsetof the local spreading phase.Applying the exponential t to all the countries with at least seven daysof con rmed cases, we can visualize the current situation of the COVID-19outbreak. Fig. 7 shows the worldwide distribution of the Percentage GrowthRate per Day based in the week of March 9th-15th, 2020. About some of thecountries that have received more coverage in the news recently, either becausewere the rst to show cases, or have a large numbers of cases, or high dailyrates: China is of course in the lower rate group, as it has virtually containedthe spreading of the virus. Japan is also in this group, with 8% spreading rate.In the second group there is Italy with 19% rate, after having rates over 100%more that 3 weeks after the arriving of the rst case. The group under 30%is the more populated, with many EU countries like France (24%), Sweden(28%), and Germany (29%). In the next group we have Switzerland (30%)and US (33%). In the group between 41% and 50%, we nd Brazil (41%),after 18 days from rst case, and Finland (46%), 46 days after its rst case.In the sixth group, we have South Africa (54%) and Denmark (55%). Over60%, we have Colombia (70%) and Qatar (72%). Finally, Brunei (107%) isthe only country over 100%. For the complete list of countries, see Table I inthe Appendix.week from March 9th-15th, 2020. The size of the pie-chart portions representthe fraction of countries inside each growth rate range.The analyzed data of the pandemic of COVID-19 in the period from Jan22nd - March 15th, 2020, points out two di erent types of epidemic growth:sub-exponential and exponential. The sub-exponential pattern is representedmainly by China with almost all its regions, South Korea after exiting fromthe exponential regime, and maybe Japan and Iran.The sub-exponential growing associated to a continuously slow of theexponent single out the result of simultaneous implementation of measures inChina that made possible the relatively fast containment of the outbreak,stabilizing the number of cases. As a result, two months after the rst o cialWHO report [6], the total number of reported cases in China is excellentlyrepresented by a sigmoid, as we can see in Fig. 8.20 30Day (after Jan 22nd 2020)4050University [4], as a function of days after rst reporting day (Jan 22nd, 2020)and tting with a sigmoid function, correlation coe cient R = 0:96.Another important fact about China is that all its provinces/regions followthe same epidemic pattern. This is an evidence that China was able to containthe outbreak through a series of nationwide coordinated measures,corroborating the ndings of WHO's joint mission in China [7] and setting China asthe most successful case in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemics so far.Apart from these exceptions, the remaining countries appear to follow anexponential pattern. But even within the exponential framework we canobserve di erent behaviours: either the countries have a dormant phase followedby an exponential stage or they already start on the exponential stage. Inboth cases, these patterns lead towards a quicker growth on the number ofcases than those seem in China. Besides that, the scenario described by Fig. 7is rather concerning: half of the countries are increasing cases counts on a 20%to 50% daily base, and almost one sixth is experiencing a growth even fasterthan this.Some comments regarding the basic reproductive number Ro, and itsestimation from the data here analyzed: the exponential growth rates from Fig. 7are related with the parameters(infectiveness) and(rate of removed) ofthe SIR model (sol. of Eq. (1)) as B =. As= 1= , we end up withB= R01, where R0 =. Then R0 = 1 + B . Assuming thatcan be inthe range 5-10 days, we estimate R0 for three selected countries. With thelowest growth rate B = 0:016day 1 for South Korea, we obtain 1:08 < R0 < 1:16,nearly to the epidemic threshold. On the other hand, for the biggest growthrate B = 0:725day 1 for Brunei, we obtain 4:6 < R0 < 8:3. On theintermediate growth rates seeing in some EU countries, Sweden has 2:2 < R0 < 3:5, inagreement early estimates of this number that put it around 3 [8], and withother estimation [9]. However, if we take Italy at its worst day, we get R0 aslarge as 10.Although worsening of the international scenario is expected, there are othercountries out of China that can be look as examples of how to contain thisepidemics. In fact, we observe that it is possible to slow the epidemic spreadin both exponential frameworks: a few European countries - like Netherlandsand Switzerland - started directly in the exponential stage and were still ableto quickly reduce the magnitude of theirs coe cient. On the other hand, bothSouth Korea and Italy had a spike after the ending of their dormant phaseand have signi cantly lowered their growth rate per day after the adoptionof containment measures like massive testing (South Korea) and lock-downs(Italy). In the case of Italy the situation is much worse because the lower ofthe rate is not enough: still at 20% rate and with more than 27,000 cases, ifno further lowering is attained quickly, the nation health system can soon beoverwhelmed.There is still a growing pandemics of COVID-19 to be contained. For that,the two months epidemic in China and the more recent outbreaks in Europeand Asia already serve as examples for the rest of nations to decide on how tomanage this urgent and vital problem. The pattern observed in the currentmost a ected countries reinforces the need to immediately implement massive,e ective and coordinated containment strategies all around the world. Socialdistancing, isolation, quarantine have already mentioned as key-base [10]. Themassive use of protection when interaction can not be avoided is anothermeasure used in China and South Korea. And ultimately, temperature controls athouse's members as was done in China to have a detailed account of thenumbers of cases has to be considered too.SG acknowledges CAPES for support, under fellowship #003/2019PROPG - PRINT/UFRGS, and URPP Social Networks and University ofZu\u007frich for hospitality.Rate range (%) Countries010+1020+20+30+40+50+6030405060100Andorra, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cameroon, China, Holy See, Japan, Kuwait,Nepal, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, TogoAlgeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Georgia,India, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Monaco, San Marino,Thailand, United Arab Emirates, VietnamAfghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, CostaRica, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Lebanon,Liechtenstein, Martinique, Mexico, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Russia,Senegal, Sweden, Ukraine, United KingdomAustria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czechia, Ireland, Malta, Norway, Pakistan,Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, USBrazil, Chile, Finland, Indonesia, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, Philippines,Poland, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Spain, TunisiaArmenia, Colombia, Luxembourg, Qatar, Serbia+100Bruneispreading for the Covid-19.
