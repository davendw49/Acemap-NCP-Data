We have no conflictof interest to disclose.Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by thenovel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a hugethreat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regardingnosocomial infection of COVID-19 and the risk factors in favor of severe conversion ofnon-severe case with COVID-19.Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features ofCOVID-19 in terms of nosocomial infection and explain the association ofcardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases.Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 41 consecutive hospitalizedhealth staff from own hospital with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the CentralHospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020.Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data andin-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up wasFebruary 23, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs andthose without CVMs.Results: Of 41 hospitalized staff with COVID-19, clinicians and clinical nursesaccounted for 80.5%, while nosocomial infection by patient contact accounted for87.8%. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 \u00b1 9.2 and lesscomorbidities than community population, and featured predominantly mild course(95.1%). The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever(82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequentinitial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%).There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to theofficial standard in China. Only two cases (4.9%) suffered from respiratory failure oracute respiratory distress syndrome, defined as severe or critical cases. Patients withCVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively.Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lowerbaseline lymphocyte count (0.99 \u00b1 0.43 and 1.55 \u00b1 0.61, P<0.001), more who had atleast once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). Therate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group(75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that,coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated withinhospital adverse events.Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 were nosocomial infection,featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from moreinhospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were notindependently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.Key words: novel coronavirus pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; cardiovascular manifestation; nosocomialinfection          Ever since December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), which firstlyappeared in Wuhan and then rapidly spread nationwide and abroad, has taken 2445lives and confirmedly infected 77042 cases in China as of February 23, 2020. Outsideof China, cases have been reported in 28 countries [1-6]. The acute respiratoryinfectious disease caused by infection of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)          As clinic experiences increases, clinicians become conscious of cardiovascularcomorbidities and manifestations of COVID-19. Two reports showed that patients withCOVID-19 and hypertension or coronary artery disease had worse in-hospitaloutcomes [8, 9]. Cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) could be the initialpresentation or appear throughout the whole course of COVID-19. Liu et al analyzed137 cases with COVID-19 and found that patients who complains palpitation as initialsymptom accounted for 7.3% [10]. The first report of 41 cases with COVID-19 admittedfrom December 1, 2019 to January 2, 2020, revealed acute cardiac injury occurred in12% of patients [11]. Wang et al reported in a single-center case series involving 138patients with COVID-19, also found that cardiovascular complications of COVID-19were not rare, among which arrhythmia and acute cardiac injury accounted for 16.7%and 7.2%, respectively. The level of hypersensitive troponin I on admission wassignificantly higher in those who had been admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) thanthose who had not [12]. Meanwhile, Wang et al hospital-associated transmission of2019-nCoV was suspected in about 41% of patients. And clinician and clinical nurseaccounted for 29% of total, shockingly [12]. The NCP Emergency ResponseEpidemiology Team of China reported a total of 1716 health workers have becomeinfected and 5 have died (0.3%) as of February 11, 2020 [13]. The detailed data arestill limited, regarding the clinical manifestations, epidemiological characteristics,treatment situation and outcomes in this special population. Therefore, this studyanalyzed a group of hospital staff diagnosed as COVID-19 to figure out this issue.Further, a comparative study was applied to explain whether concomitant CVMs hadeffect on the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases.As a retrospective study and data analysis were performed anonymously, therequirement for informed consent was waived. The Ethics Committees of the CentralHospital of Wuhan approved this study.A group of staff of the Central Hospital of Wuhan with confirmed COVID-19admitted to the Pneumology Department of the Central Hospital of Wuhan fromJanuary 15 to January 24, 2020, were enrolled. Oral consent was obtained frompatients. The Central Hospital of Wuhan located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, theendemic areas of COVID-19, is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals affiliatedto Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and isresponsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by government. All patientswith COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according to WHO interimguidance, as well as the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme of COVID-19 (the fifth trialedition) by National Health Commission and National Administration of TraditionalChinese Medicine of China [14, 15]. The clinical outcomes (ie, in-hospital adverseevents, nucleic acid detection) were monitored up to February 23, 2020, the final dateof follow-up.The medical records of patients were collected into a database by the researcherof the Central Hospital of Wuhan from electronic medical records system.Epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings,treatment and outcomes data were first-hand obtained. The data were reviewed by atrained team of physicians in Fuwai hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciencesand Peking Union Medical College. Information recorded included demographic data,medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms and signs, laboratoryfindings, chest computed tomographic (CT) scans, nucleic acid detection of throatswab, treatment measures and in-hospital adverse events. The date of disease onsetwas defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. Treatment included antiviraltherapy, antibiotics or anti-fungus drugs, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous humanalbumin or immunoglobulin, thymosin, traditional Chinese medicine, mesenchymalstem cell therapy and respiratory support. None received kidney replacement therapy,plasma exchange or artificial liver.Respiratory failure (RF) was diagnosed according to arterial blood gas analysis.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined according to the Berlindefinition [15, 16]. Acute cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiacbiomarkers (mainly creatine kinase-MB and hypersensitive cardiac troponin I) wereabove the 99th percentile upper reference limit, with a tendency to rise or fall, or newabnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography during thewhole course of disease [12]. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to theKidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition [17]. Acute hepatic injury wasrecognized when elevated level of serum aminotransferase or bilirubin was detectedduring hospitalization, which cannot be explained by background disease. Acutemyocyte injury was recognized as myalgia or fatigue along with acute hypercreatinekinasemia (peak sCK is >or=3 x normal) while no evidence on myocardial injury [18].Shock was identified according to treatment guideline of severe sepsis/septic shock(China) [19]. Secondary infection was diagnosed by any one of: 1, elevated neutrophilpercentage or procalcitonin; 2, respiratory purulent secretion, increased coughing ofphlegm or moist rales; 3, radiological features of bacteria or fungus infection.Inhospital adverse events included RF or ARDS, transfer to ICU, invasive mechanicventilation, acute cardiac injury, AKI, acute hepatic injury, acute myocyte injury, shock,secondary infection and death. Cases with CVMs were defined by any one of thesethroughout the course of disease: 1, complain of palpitation or chest distress; 2,elevation of creatine kinase-MB or hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (above the 99thpercentile upper reference limit); 3, new abnormalities on electrocardiographyincluding sinus tachycardia.Throat swab samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 ribose nucleicacid (RNA) from patients with suspected or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (MiracleanTechnology Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China). After collection, the throat swabs were placedinto a collection tube with virus preservation solution, and total RNA was extractedusing the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit (Automated Nucleic Acid ExtractionSystem, Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd, China). The suspension was used for real-timereverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Two target genes, including open reading frame lab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsidprotein(N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time RT-PCRassay. The real time RT-PCR assay was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic aciddetection kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Shanghai BioGerm MedicalBiotechnology Co., Ltd, China). All SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Detection Kits wereprovided by Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A cycle thresholdvalue (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive result, while a Ct-value of 40 ormore was defined as negative. A Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required retest toconfirm. Specific primers and probes for detection SARS-CoV-2 and the diagnosticcriteria were referred to the recommendation by the National Institute for ViralData statistics was applied using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA).Student\u2019s t-tests were used to compare continuous variables, which conform to anormal distribution, while Chi\u2011square tests were applied to compare categoricalvariables between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses wereapplied to control baseline confounders. Covariates for logistic regression were thosevariables with significant differences between the two groups in baseline. All P valueswere two sided with a significance level of 0.05. Tendency of significant difference wasjudged when 0.05<P<0.1.Epidemiological CharacteristicsThe study population included 41 hospitalized staff with confirmed COVID-19.The mean age was 39.1 (\u00b1 9.2) years, and 17 (41.5%) were men. The clinician andclinical nurse, who had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, accounted for 46.3%and 34.1%, respectively. Cases from medical detection departments accounted for12.2%, who also had contact with COVID-19 patients or their specimen. Only 3 (7.3%)cases were from administrative or logistics departments, who mostly had contactedwith infected colleagues. Recalling epidemiological history, 97% of all could tell howthey infected. Definite nosocomial infection by patient contact accounted for 73.2%,while suspected nosocomial infection by possible patient contact accounted for 14.6%.Only 2 cases (4.9%) told contact with infected family members, but they had alsocontacted with suspected COVID-19 patients, making the clue questioning. (Table 1)As a young and middle-aged population, mostly of them were generally healthy,presented as less comorbidities (29.3%) than general community populationpreviously reported [11, 12]. The comorbidities with high incidence in the elderly likediabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and malignant tumor were all lower than 5.0%.The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed in this study werefever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three mostfrequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%), and cough(41.5%). Furthermore, other symptoms during course of disease included sputumproduction (39.0%), wheeze (34.1%), dyspnea (29.3%), chilly or shivering (29.3%),diarrhea (19.5%), dizziness (12.2%), somnipathy (12.2%), rhinobyon or running nose(9.8%), headache (4.9%), bloody sputum (2.4%), conjunctivitis (2.4%). (Table 1)The mean white blood cell (WBC) count was 4.89 (\u00b1 1.83) \u00d710\u2079/L. Cases with WBCcount below 4.0\u00d710\u2079/L accounted for 36.6%. The mean lymphocyte count was 1.22 (\u00b10.58) \u00d710\u2079/L. Cases with lymphocyte count below 1.0\u00d710\u2079/L accounted for 34.1%.Cases with procalcitonin below 0.2 ng/mL accounted for 97.6%. (Table 2)There were 26 of the 41 enrolled patients (63.4%) who showed bilateralinvolvement of chest computed tomography (CT) scan at the first time since onset.And cases with bilateral involvement of chest CT scan during admission accounted for80.5%, lower than the percentage previously reported [11, 12] (Table 2, Figure 1).All 41 cases received at least twice nucleic acid detection of throat swab duringadmission. Only those with normal temperature for more than 3 days, improvedrespiratory symptoms, obvious absorption of pulmonary inflammation on radiography,as well as twice negative nucleic acid detection of throat swab with interval more than24 hours, can be released from quarantine and discharged, according to the DiagnosisandTreatment(thefifthtrialedition)byNational Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional ChineseMedicine of China [15]. Cases with positive detection at first time accounted for 24.4%,while those with at least once positive result during admission accounted for 34.1%.(Table 2)There were 40 cases (97.6%) received at least one kind of antiviral drugsempirically including oseltamivir, ribavirin, arbidol or lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra),which were accessible clinically in China. Antibiotics or anti-fungus drugs were appliedin 95.1% cases regarding to confirmed secondary infection or preventing secondaryinfection in relatively severe cases. Corticosteroid was used in 78.0% cases tocontrol immune overreaction. Human albumin was applied when serum albumindecreased below 30g/L. Immunoglobulin was also applied empirically, as well asthymosin. Cases who received Chinese traditional medicine accounted for only 17.1%,including patent medicine and prescription. There were 3 cases as of February 23received mesenchymal stem cell therapy after informed consent. One of them firstlyconsented this empirical therapy on day 35 after symptom onset as pulmonaryinflammation poorly absorbed on CT scan (Figure 1). There were 23 cases (56.1%)underwent respiratory support, including oxygen therapy through only common nasalcatheter, face mask, both common nasal catheter and face mask simultaneously, highflow nasal cannula and mechanic ventilation. Only one case suffered fromirreformable hypoxemia, received noninvasive ventilator support, and latertransferred to ICU for tracheal intubation. (Table 3)There was none in-hospital death, and none suffered from acute cardiac injury orAKI during admission as to February 23,2020. Two cases were diagnosed as RF or ARDS(4.9%). Most cases featured non-severe course of disease, accounted for 95.1%according to official criteria [15, 25]. One case was recognized as acute myocyte injury(2.4%). Cases suffered from acute hepatic injury accounted for 19.5%, who all receivedconventional liver protecting treatment including Essentiale or diammoniumglycyrrhizinate. Secondary infection happened in 19 cases (46.3%). Only one case(2.4%) transferred to the negative pressure respiratory ward of ICU in Wuhan ChestHospital for invasive mechanical ventilation and received extracorporeal membraneoxygenation (ECMO) support on the next day due to rapid deterioration. The totalinhospital adverse event rate was 53.7%. There are still 8 cases not up to the dischargecriteria on the final date of follow-up, despite of clinical improvement, of which onecase whose nucleic acid detection of throat swab remains positive, being a possibilityof relapse [15, 25]. (Table 4)Among 41 cases analyzed, patients with CVMs and those without CVMsaccounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs,patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 \u00b10.43 and 1.55 \u00b1 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic aciddetection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and morereceived oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The in-hospital adverse eventshappened more in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001).Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, after adjustment of the possiblebaseline confounders, concomitant with CVMs was not independently associated within-hospital adverse events (OR 2.23, 95%CI 0.24-20.27, P = 0.478) in COVID-19 patients.Baseline lymphocyte count showed a tendency of significance between the twogroups in model (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.02-1.26, P = 0.081). (Table 5)The analyzed population is characterized as younger age, less comorbidities thancommon community patients [11, 12], and mostly featured non-severe course ofdisease, which is probably an important clinical characteristic of COVID-19 nosocomialinfection of hospital staff. As of February 23, 2020, only one case underwent invasivemechanic ventilation and ECMO support. Other cases all presented markedlyimprovement of symptoms and findings on chest CT images, due to aggressive andcomprehensive medical treatment, although they also suffered from many adverseevents during hospitalization, like secondary infection or acute hepatic injury. Thisresult is consistent with the situation of infected hospital workers in a large datareported by the NCP Emergency Response Epidemiology Team of China [13].Our data showed that, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital staff were mostlynosocomial, which was consistent with most reports. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2mainly characterized as confined space and close contact. No other countries aroundthe world experiences a similar time in great favor of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likethe Spring Festival and the Spring Festival travel season in China. During this period ofyear in China, people\u2019 s lives are full of behavior styles characterized as confined spaceand close contact, including air or railway transportation for return home or travel,various familial or public get-togethers. Nosocomial infection is another key featureof the outbreak. At the early time of prevalence, a large number of suspected patientssqueezed into fever clinics or emergency departments of hospitals in Wuhan, in whichhealth workers had not well prepared in terms of both protective supplies andawareness. Meanwhile, patients in incubation period of COVID-19 underwent electivesurgeries who were diagnosed after procedures made nosocomial infection quite afew on the early stage of the outbreak. As continually support of protective materialsfrom other areas into Hubei Province, as well as improved knowledge of protection,data with decreased risk of nosocomial infection are expected.Xu et al reported the pathological findings of a 50-year-old male with COVID-19,died of ARDS and sudden cardiac arrest. They found that there were a few interstitialmononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, but no other substantial damage in the hearttissue [20]. The result implied the possibility of coexisting myocarditis, as part ofsystemic inflammatory response syndrome. And the persistent hypoxemia maydirectly cause myocardial suppression, possibly related to sudden cardiac arrest [21].In other words, the CVMs of COVID-19 maybe more associated with the systemicimmune reaction, rather than direct damage of heart by virus attack. And thesemechanisms maybe explain the concomitant CVMs of COVID-19 were notindependently associated with adverse in-hospital outcomes to some extent.In this study, there were about 20.5% of cases with non-severe course ofCOVID19 suffered from acute hepatic injury, needed liver protection treatment. And itprobably should not be totally attributed to drug-induced liver injury and arousedmore concern on COVID-19 itself. Xu et al reported the liver biopsy specimens of thepatient with COVID-19 showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular andportal activity, indicating the injury could have been caused by either SARS-CoV-2infection or drug-induced liver injury [20]. Pathological findings were also in favor ofmore attention to the hepatic injury in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.There is no specific antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection up to now. Expectationmainly comes from evidences that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective inthe control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro, while their cytotoxicity remains in control[22]. It was reported that remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug, in previouslyclinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, exhibited broad-spectrumanti-coronavirus (CoV) activity. It could inhibit severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERSCoV) replication in multiple in vitro systems, and was also effective against bat CoVs,prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary humanlung cells. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and earlytherapeutic administration of remdesivir significantly reduced lung viral load andimproved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function [23]. These preclinicalevidences, together with successful clinical cases treated by remdesivir in USA andFrance [24] made us looking forward to the final result of the randomized controlledtrial unblinding before long in Wuhan. Meanwhile, chloroquine has been recentlywritten into official recommendation for empirical therapy of COVID-19 for itsadequate safety data in human [25]. It is a cheap and safe drug that has been used asan antimalarial for more than 70 years. Combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Kaletra)among SARS-CoV patients was reported a substantial clinical benefit [26]. As it isavailable in the designated hospital as anti-human immunodeficiency virus drug, arandomized controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safetyof it [11]. Other medication as newly recommended officially are mostly empirical.Experience came from the outbreak of SARS-CoV 17 years ago. From empiricalmedicine to evidence-based medicine, it is the only way which must be passed thatforms comprehensive knowledge about the new virus and the new disease. And forthis, the Chinese people have paid a heavy price, deserved to be remembered.Firstly, the cases enrolled in this study were only hospital staff. The conclusioncannot be extrapolated to common community patients. Secondly, as the suddennessof the outbreak, the vast patient volume in hospitals and shortage of healthcarepersonnel, it is hard to obtain large high-quality clinical data. The sample is not largeenough for observation of mortality in severe cases of COVID-19. The multivariatemodel analysis had limitation due to the sample size. And we cannot figure up howthe research variable effected each adverse in-hospital event. Lastly, the in-hospitaloutcomes were monitored up to February 23, 2020, the final date of follow-up. Theincomplete follow-up data will be made up constantly. Besides, we are trying to collectthe data of the severe case who transferred to other hospital. Nevertheless, this isfirst-hand data in terms of nosocomial infection in Wuhan, and the first analysiscomparing the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 between cases with CVMs and thosewithout CVMs, in anticipation of finding the risk factors in favor of severe conversionof non-severe case.19.Most hospital staff with COVID-19 were nosocomial infection, featured anonsevere course of disease. COVID-19 patients with CVMs suffered from moreinhospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But the concomitant CVMs werenot independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in patients withCOVID1.

While, the three most frequentinitial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%).There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to theofficial standard in China. Patients withCVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Key words: novel coronavirus pneumonia; coronavirus disease 2019; severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; cardiovascular manifestation; nosocomialinfection          Ever since December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), which firstlyappeared in Wuhan and then rapidly spread nationwide and abroad, has taken 2445lives and confirmedly infected 77042 cases in China as of February 23, 2020. And clinician and clinical nurseaccounted for 29% of total, shockingly [12]. Therefore, this studyanalyzed a group of hospital staff diagnosed as COVID-19 to figure out this issue. The Ethics Committees of the CentralHospital of Wuhan approved this study. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings,treatment and outcomes data were first-hand obtained. The data were reviewed by atrained team of physicians in Fuwai hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciencesand Peking Union Medical College. The date of disease onsetwas defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. Treatment included antiviraltherapy, antibiotics or anti-fungus drugs, corticosteroid therapy, intravenous humanalbumin or immunoglobulin, thymosin, traditional Chinese medicine, mesenchymalstem cell therapy and respiratory support. None received kidney replacement therapy,plasma exchange or artificial liver. Cases from medical detection departments accounted for12.2%, who also had contact with COVID-19 patients or their specimen. Only those with normal temperature for more than 3 days, improvedrespiratory symptoms, obvious absorption of pulmonary inflammation on radiography,as well as twice negative nucleic acid detection of throat swab with interval more than24 hours, can be released from quarantine and discharged, according to the DiagnosisandTreatment(thefifthtrialedition)byNational Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional ChineseMedicine of China [15]. Table 4)Among 41 cases analyzed, patients with CVMs and those without CVMsaccounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. As of February 23, 2020, only one case underwent invasivemechanic ventilation and ECMO support. Other medication as newly recommended officially are mostly empirical. Firstly, the cases enrolled in this study were only hospital staff. Secondly, as the suddennessof the outbreak, the vast patient volume in hospitals and shortage of healthcarepersonnel, it is hard to obtain large high-quality clinical data. Besides, we are trying to collectthe data of the severe case who transferred to other hospital. Nevertheless, this isfirst-hand data in terms of nosocomial infection in Wuhan, and the first analysiscomparing the in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 between cases with CVMs and thosewithout CVMs, in anticipation of finding the risk factors in favor of severe conversionof non-severe case.19.Most hospital staff with COVID-19 were nosocomial infection, featured anonsevere course of disease. COVID-19 patients with CVMs suffered from moreinhospital adverse events than those without CVMs. Coronavirus infections\u2014more than just thecommon cold [published January 23, 2020]. Vincent J.
