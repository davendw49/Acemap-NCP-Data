Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection is crucial for evaluating the likely effectiveness of control measures and potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases 2019-nCoV in Wuhan and exported cases originating in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time and the likely prevalence of symptomatic cases in the city as of 23rd January 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases would generate outbreaks in other areas. We estimated that the median reproduction number, \u200bR\u200b , fluctuated between 1.6-2.9 from mid-December to mid-January 2020. We found that the US, Australia and France had more confirmed cases with travel history to Wuhan than the model predicted, and estimated that there were 29,500 (14,300-85,700) prevalent symptomatic cases in Wuhan on 23rd January 2020, when travel restrictions were introduced. Based on our estimates of \u200bR\u200b , we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan, once there are more than three introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population.\u200b \u200bOur\u200b \u200bresults show that 2019-nCoV has substantial potential for ongoing human-to-human transmission, and exported cases from Wuhan may have increased prior to travel restrictions being introduced on 23rd January 2020. As more cases arrive in international locations, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.", "text": "        As of 30th January 2020, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has resulted in 7,818confirmed cases \u200b(                To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmissiondynamic model \u200b(                In the model, individuals were divided into four infection classes (Figure 1): susceptible,exposed (but not yet infectious), infectious, and removed (i.e. isolated, recovered or otherwise nolonger infectious). The model accounted for delays in symptom onset and reporting, as well asuncertainty in case observation (see Supplementary Materials for full model details). Theincubation period was assumed to be Erlang distributed with mean 5.2 days \u200b(                The model reproduced the observed temporal trend of cases observed within Wuhan and casesexported internationally (Figure 2A\u2013B). It could also reproduce the pattern of confirmedexported cases from Wuhan, which was not explicitly used in the model fitting (Figure 2C). Wefound that confirmed and estimated exported cases among the twenty countries most connectedto China were generally in good correspondence, with the USA and Australia as notable outliers,having had more confirmed cases reported with a travel history to Wuhan than would beexpected in the model (Figure 2D). Accounting for under-reporting and delays to confirmation,our estimates suggest that the prevalence of symptomatic 2019-nCoV cases in Wuhan was29,500 (                To examine the potential for new outbreaks to establish in locations outside of Wuhan, we usedour estimates of the reproduction number to simulate new outbreaks with potentialindividual-level variation in transmission (i.e. \u2018superspreading\u2019 events) \u200b(        Based our on estimated reproduction number, and published estimates of individual-levelvariation in transmission for SARS and MERS-CoV, we found that a single case introduced to anew location would not necessarily lead to an outbreak. Even if the reproduction number is ashigh as it has been in Wuhan, it may take several introductions for an outbreak to establish. Thishighlights the importance of rapid case identification, and subsequent isolation and other controlmeasures to reduce the chance of onward chains of transmission.        Our analysis highlights the value of combining multiple data sources in analysis of 2019-nCoV.For example, the rapid growth of confirmed cases globally during late January 2020, with casetotals in some instances apparently doubling every day or so, would have the effect of inflating \u200bRestimates to implausibly large values if only these recent data points were used in analysis. Ourresults also have implications for the estimation of transmission dynamics using the number ofexported cases from a specific area \u200b(                There are several limitations to our analysis. We used plausible biological parameters for2019-nCoV based on current evidence, but these values may be refined as more comprehensivedata become available. However, because we fitted to multiple datasets to infer modelparameters, and performed sensitivity analyses on key areas of uncertainty, we would not expectour findings to change substantially if new information becomes available. Further, we usedpublicly available connectivity and risk estimates based on international travel data to predict thenumber of exported cases into each country. These estimates have shown good correspondencewith the distribution of exported cases to date \u200b(                We also assumed that the latent period is equal to the incubation period (i.e. individuals becomeinfectious and symptomatic at the same time) and all infected individuals will eventually becomesymptomatic. However, there is some limited evidence that transmission of 2019-nCoV canoccur without reported symptoms \u200b(        This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grants 206250/Z/17/Z and 210758/Z/18/Z) andHDR UK (grant: MR/S003975/1).We used a stochastic SEIR model implemented using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm with a 6hour timestep, with the transmission rate following geometric brownian motion.

We assume that these are all inWuhan. The most recent two data points were omitted during fitting as they are likely tobe strongly influenced by delays in reporting.4. Validation dataset (not used for fitting): Daily incidence of exported infection fromWuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (i.e. top 20 most atrisk), by date of confirmation. We only considered individual export events (i.e. a familyof travellers was counted as a single export).        We created a single timeseries for case onset data by in Wuhan by combining datasets 3 and 4above. To calculate the likelihood, we used a Poisson observation model fitted jointly toexpected values based on three model outputs: \u200bD\u200b W\u200b(t), D\u200b T\u200b(t), C\u200b T\u200b(t)\u200b .
