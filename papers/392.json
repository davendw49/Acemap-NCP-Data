Amongthem are the coronaviruses (CoVs) which possess the largest known monopartite RNA genomes and areclassified into four genera\u2014Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, andDeltacoronavirus (2). Over the past two decades, Beta-CoVs, including the viruses responsible forSevere Acute Respiratory Syndro        We retrieved the SARS-related CoV genomes by searching against the non-redundant (nr) nucleotidedatabase of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with the SARS-CoV-2 genomesequence (NC_045512.2) as a query (12). The program CD-HIT was used for similarity-based clustering(13). A multiple sequence alignment of whole virus genomes was performed by KALIGN (14). Based onthe MSA, a similarity plot was constructed by a custom Python script, which calculated the identitybetween each subject sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence based on a custom slidingwindow size and step size. Open reading frames of virus genomes used in this study were extractedfrom an NCBI Genbank file.To collect protein homologs, iterative sequence profile searches were conducted by the programsPSIBLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST)(12) and JACKHMMER (15), which searched against thenonredundant (nr) protein database of NCBI with a cut-off e-value of 0.005 serving as the significancethreshold. Similarity-based clustering was conducted by BLASTCLUST, a BLAST score-based single-linkageclustering method (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastclust.html). Multiple sequencealignments were built by the KALIGN (14), MUSCLE(16) and PROMALS3D(17) programs, followed bycareful manual adjustments based on the profile\u2013profile alignment, the secondary structure informationand the structural alignment. Profile-profile comparison was conducted using the HHpred program (18).The consensus of the alignment was calculated using a custom Perl script. The alignments were coloredusing an in-house alignment visualization program written in perl and further modified using adobeillustrator. Signal peptides were predicted by the SignalP-5.0 Server (19). The transmembrane regionswere predicted by the TMHMM Server v. 2.0 (20).By using the protein remote relationship detection methods, we generated a collection of distinct Igdomains from the Pfam database (21) and also from our local domain database. Then, we utilized thehmmscan program of the HMMER package (22) and RPS-BLAST (12, 23) to retrieve the homologs fromviral genomes.The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTTw/freq. model (24). The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. Support values out of 100bootstraps are shown next to the branches (25). Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtainedautomatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distancesestimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with the superior log likelihood value. Adiscrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4categories). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable. The tree isdrawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The tree diagramwas generated using MEGA Tree Explorer (26)Position-wise Shannon entropy (H) for a given multiple sequence alignment was calculated using theequation:P is the fraction of residues of amino acid type i, and M is the number of amino acid types. The Shannonentropy for the ith position in the alignment ranges from 0 (only one residue at that position) to 4.32 (all20 residues equally represented at that position). Analysis of the entropy values which were thusderived was performed using the R language.The secondary structural prediction was conducted using the Jnet (Joint Network) program (27). Jnet is aneural network-based predictor which trains neural networks from three different types of profiles:profile PSSM, profile HMM, and residue frequency profile. It generates a consensus secondary structurewith an average accuracy of 72% or greater.          The Modeller9v1 program (Sali and Blundell, 1993) was utilized for homology modeling of structure ofSARS-CoV-2 ORF8 using the SARS-CoV ORF7 (1xak_A) (28) as a template. Since in these lowsequenceidentity cases, sequence alignment is the most important factor affecting the quality of the model(Cozze          Comparative genomics unveils fast-evolving regions of SARS-related CoV genomesThe host-pathogen arms-race has selected for a disparate complement of viral genes involved inpathogenesis. These genes often rapidly diversify through recombination and mutations to keep up withthe evolution of host resistance. To identify proteins with potential pathogenic roles in COVID-19, weconducted a comparative genomic analysis of the coronaviruses. Similarity plots show that the bat CoVRaTG13 is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 with no evidence for recombination between them (Figure1 and Figure S1). SARS-CoV-2 also shows good similarity to two other bat viruses, CoVZXC21 andCoVZXC45, first in the 5\u2019 half of ORF1 and again after nucleotide number 20,000 of the genome.However, the remaining part of ORF1 of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 show no specific relationship to theseviruses. This suggests a recombination event between the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13,and probably another member of the SARS-related clade close to CoVZXC21 and CoVZXC45. In additionto this major recombination event, we identified several smaller regions which might have undergonerecombinational diversification during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure S1). Notably,many of them are clustered in three regions displaying extensive diversification, corresponding to theNterminal region of the ORF1a polyprotein, the Spike protein, and the uncharacterized protein encodedby ORF8 (Figure 1 and Figure S1).Among these three fast-evolving proteins, we focused on the ORF8 protein as it is one of the so-calledaccessory proteins, which does not participate in viral replication (32, 33), raising the possibility that itmight have a role in viral pathogenesis. It is a predicted secreted protein present only in someBetaCoVs, including SARS-CoV-2 but not the MERS-like clade. Profile-profile comparisons using asequenceprofile built from the multiple sequence alignment of all available ORF8 proteins showed it to beunexpectedly homologous to the membrane-anchored ORF7a protein from the same subset ofBetaCoVs, and several proteins (variously annotated as ORF9 or ORF10) from a subset of bat Alpha-CoVs(Figure 2A) (probability=94% of profile-profile match) (34). ORF7a is a known member of theimmunoglobulin (Ig) domain superfamily and is specifically related to extracellular metazoan Ig domainsthat are involved in adhesion, such as ICAM (35, 36). The Beta-CoV ORF8, ORF7a and the Alpha-CoV Igdomains display a classic \u03b2-sandwich fold with seven \u03b2-stands and share the characteristic pattern oftwo cysteines which form stabilizing disulfide bonds with metazoan Ig domains (Figure 2A and Figure S2)(37). However, they are unified as a clade by the presence of an additional pair of conserveddisulfidebonding cysteines (Figure 2A). Nonetheless, there are notable structural differences between the threegroups of proteins. ORF8 is distinguished from ORF7a and Alpha-CoV Ig proteins by the loss of theCterminal transmembrane (TM) helix and the acquisition of a long insert between stands 3 and 4 with aconserved cysteine which might facilitate dimerization through disulfide-bond formation (Figure 2A).The homology model of ORF8, based on the structure of SARS-CoV ORF7a (pdb id:1XAK), suggests thatthis insert augments a potential peptide-ligand binding groove that has been proposed for ORF7a(Figure 2B and Figure S3). Hence, the emergence of the insert has gone hand-in-hand with theacquisition of a modified interaction interface.Besides these families, we identified a fourth family of Ig domains from the same Alpha-CoVs whichcontain the above-discussed ORF7a/8-like Ig family (Figure 3A). These Alpha-CoVs typically possess oneor two paralogous copies annotated as either ORF4a/b or NS5a/b. From their sequences, these Igdomains are not closely related to the ORF7a and ORF8 Ig domains (Figure S4). However, profile-profilesearches have shown that they are related to Ig domains found in the adenoviral E3-CR1 proteins(probability: 90% of matching the Pfam CR1 Ig domain profile) (Figure S4). In these searches, they alsoyield weaker hits to two other Ig domains, namely the poxviral decoy interferon receptors and humanTcell surface CD3 zeta (Figure S4).Phylogenetic analysis of ORF7a, ORF8 and Alpha-CoV Ig domains shows that each group represents adistinct clade (Figure 2C). The tree topology of ORF7a mirrors that of the polymerase tree (Figure 3A);however, the topology of the ORF8-Ig clade is not consistent with it. This might be due to arecombination event between the SARS-related CoVs (as suggested by the similarity plot analysis)and/or unusual divergence under selection. To better understand the functional difference betweenORF8 and ORF7a, we examined the column-wise Shannon entropy in the 20 amino acid alphabet andfound that the ORF8 has significantly higher mean entropy than ORF7a (ORF8: 1.09 vs ORF7a: 0.22, p<10-16 for the H0 of congruent means by t-test) (Figure 2D). By comparing column-wise entropies in boththe 20 amino acid and a reduced 8-letter alphabet (where amino acids are grouped based on similarside-chain chemistry), we found at least 14 positions in ORF8 which show high entropy in both alphabetsas compared to a single position in ORF7a (Figure 2D). This indicates that ORF8 is a fast-evolving proteinunder selection for diversity as contrast to ORF7a. Strikingly, one of these highly variable positions,which features residues with very different side characters (hydrophobic, acidic, alcoholic and proline),corresponding to Leu84 was also identified as the most variable position across 54 closely relatedhuman SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (38). In our structural model, this residue is positioned at thepredicted peptide-ligand binding groove of the ORF8-Ig domain (Figure 2B). Therefore, our entropy andstructural analysis of the ORF8-Ig domain, in conjunction with its hypervariable position found in humanSARS-CoV-2 genomes, points to a role for ORF8 at the interface of the host-virus interaction possibly in apathogenic context.We examined the distribution of CoV Ig proteins in the context of a phylogenetic tree of both Beta-andAlpha-CoVs based on their polymerase proteins (Figure 3A). Other than the two subsets of Beta-CoVsand Alpha-CoVs that contain the above-described Ig domain proteins, no other CoVs contain any Igdomain proteins (Figure 3A). The immediate sister-groups of the Ig-containing CoVs typically have Spike,E, M and N, and one or two other uncharacterized accessory proteins which are not Ig domains to ourbest knowledge. The Alpha-CoV ORF9/10 share a C-terminal TM helix and, along with ORF7a of theBetaCoVs, lack the insert in the Ig domain (Figure 2A). Hence, it is possible that this architecture representsthe ancestral state which was present in the common ancestor of both Alpha-CoVs and Beta-CoVs.Under this scenario, the protein was displaced/lost both in certain Alpha-CoVs and Beta-CoVs.Alternatively, ORF7a could have been exchanged between Alpha- and Beta-CoVs by a recombinationevent. In both scenarios, ORF8 arose likely via a duplication of ORF7a in specifically the Beta-CoVs.Although we couldn\u2019t identify the ultimate precursors of the CoV Ig domains, they are likely to havebeen acquired on at least two independent occasions from different sources. The CoV ORF7a-ORF8families might have derived from the metazoan adhesion Ig families, and the ORF4a/b-like Ig domains ofAlpha-CoVs were likely acquired from adenoviral CR1 Ig domains with which they share some specificsequence features.The presence of multiple Ig domains with different affinities in CoVs prompted us to more generallysurvey animal viruses for Ig domains. By using the Pfam models (39) and our own PSSMs created fromPSI-BLAST runs with Ig domains (12), we were able to identify about 17 distinct viral Ig domain familiesin a wider diversity of animal viruses (Figure 3B and Table S2). In addition to CoVs, such Ig domainproteins can be found in adenoviruses, NCLDVs, Herpesviruses and Phenuiviruses. These viral Ig domainsare highly divergent; many of them are only found in certain viral groups. However, the majority have anarchitecture comparable to the CoV-Ig domains, with an N-terminal signal peptide, one or multiple Igdomains and a C-terminal TM region often followed by a stretch of basic residues. Thus, although the Igdomains are not the universally preserved component of viruses, they have been acquired and selectedindependently by a wide range of viruses. The presence of a proofreading 3\u2019-5\u2019 exonuclease has beenproposed to favor the emergence of larger RNA genomes in CoVs (40). Indeed, this might have alsocontributed to the acquisition of potential pathogenesis factors such as the Ig domains described hereinwhich are comparable to those seen in DNA viruses.Why have diverse viruses independently acquired the Ig domain during their evolution? First, the Igdomains are major mediators of adhesive interactions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (37, 41, 42).Thus, this domain can be used for adherence for cell to cell spread (e.g. herpesviral Ig domain proteins)(43). Further, Ig domains are major building blocks of metazoan immune systems. Thus, viruses oftenutlize this domain to disrupt immune signaling of the host. For example, in adenoviruses, the CR1 Igdomain proteins have been shown to block the surface expression on infected cells of class I majorhistocompatibility complex molecules by blocking their trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)to Golgi (44). This has been shown to affect the host inflammatory response and modulates thepresentation of viral antigens to T-cells (45). In poxvirus, the secreted Ig domain proteins function asinterferon receptors or decoys that bind the interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 and disrupt signaling via the endogenoushost receptors (46). Further, SARS-ORF7a has been implicated in the interaction with bone marrowstromal antigen 2 (BST-2), which tethers budding virions to the host cell in a broad-spectrum antiviralresponse, to prevent the N-linked glycosylation of BST-2 thereby crippling the host response against thevirus (47). Given their shared evolutionary history and similar sequence and structural features, wepredict that the newly identified CoV Ig domain proteins, such as ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2, might similarlyfunction as immune modulators.While ORF8 is a paralog of ORF7a, its lack of the TM segment, unique insert and significantly more rapidevolution suggest that it has acquired a distinct function and has been under strong positive selectionOne possible mechanism is that, like the adenoviral CR1 proteins, it interferes with MHC molecules toattenuate antigen presentation, resulting in ineffective detection of the virus by the host immunesystem. Consistent with this, the SARS-CoV ortholog translocates to the ER (48) and its higher variabilityindicates probable selection due to its interaction with a rapidly evolving host molecule. Notably, whilethe SARS-CoV ORF8 isolates from civets and early stages of the human epidemic are intact, it split upinto two ORFs (ORF8a and ORF8b) during the subsequent human epidemic (49). ORF8a and ORF8b255256257258259260261262263264retain the conserved Cys residues of the Ig domain and have been observed to form a complex in ayeast-two hybrid interaction study (50). This suggests it might still fold into an intact structure held bythe two disulfide bonds formed by four conserved Cys residues.

By using genomic, sequence,\nstructural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families\nof immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses\nand two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly\nevolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its\npredicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses\nwhich are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig\ndomain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by\nviruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the\nimmune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.\nevasion", "one_words_summarize": "1920212223242526272829303132A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of an emergent severe respiratory disease(COVID-19) in humans that is threatening to result in a global health crisis. Based onthe MSA, a similarity plot was constructed by a custom Python script, which calculated the identitybetween each subject sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence based on a custom slidingwindow size and step size. Open reading frames of virus genomes used in this study were extractedfrom an NCBI Genbank file. To collect protein homologs, iterative sequence profile searches were conducted by the programsPSIBLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST)(12) and JACKHMMER (15), which searched against thenonredundant (nr) protein database of NCBI with a cut-off e-value of 0.005 serving as the significancethreshold. Similarity-based clustering was conducted by BLASTCLUST, a BLAST score-based single-linkageclustering method (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastclust.html). The alignments were coloredusing an in-house alignment visualization program written in perl and further modified using adobeillustrator. The tree isdrawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Analysis of the entropy values which were thusderived was performed using the R language. It generates a consensus secondary structurewith an average accuracy of 72% or greater. These genes often rapidly diversify through recombination and mutations to keep up withthe evolution of host resistance. Notably,many of them are clustered in three regions displaying extensive diversification, corresponding to theNterminal region of the ORF1a polyprotein, the Spike protein, and the uncharacterized protein encodedby ORF8 (Figure 1 and Figure S1).Among these three fast-evolving proteins, we focused on the ORF8 protein as it is one of the so-calledaccessory proteins, which does not participate in viral replication (32, 33), raising the possibility that itmight have a role in viral pathogenesis. Nonetheless, there are notable structural differences between the threegroups of proteins. In these searches, they alsoyield weaker hits to two other Ig domains, namely the poxviral decoy interferon receptors and humanTcell surface CD3 zeta (Figure S4).Phylogenetic analysis of ORF7a, ORF8 and Alpha-CoV Ig domains shows that each group represents adistinct clade (Figure 2C). The tree topology of ORF7a mirrors that of the polymerase tree (Figure 3A);however, the topology of the ORF8-Ig clade is not consistent with it. Other than the two subsets of Beta-CoVsand Alpha-CoVs that contain the above-described Ig domain proteins, no other CoVs contain any Igdomain proteins (Figure 3A). The Alpha-CoV ORF9/10 share a C-terminal TM helix and, along with ORF7a of theBetaCoVs, lack the insert in the Ig domain (Figure 2A). Thus, although the Igdomains are not the universally preserved component of viruses, they have been acquired and selectedindependently by a wide range of viruses. Thus, viruses oftenutlize this domain to disrupt immune signaling of the host. This suggests it might still fold into an intact structure held bythe two disulfide bonds formed by four conserved Cys residues.
