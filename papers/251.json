The COVID-19 emerged in December 2009 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among di erent locations, partially re ecting the public health intervention e ects, remains to be quanti ed. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Methods Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quanti ed the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention a ected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings We estimated that Rt declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards", "text": "Preprint submitted to Elsevier1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed bya decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio oftransmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely dueto the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the governmentbeginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious periodwas 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes whichbecame stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date ofcontainment would be one-week later in Wuhan.Interpretation Public health interventions implemented at both thesocial and personal levels are e ective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 inWuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested thatCOVID19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.1 1. Introduction2 In early December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, emerged into3 the human population in Wuhan, the pandemic center, China[1, 2, 3, 4, 5,4 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The number of SARS-COV-2 infected pneumonia(COVID5 19) cases has increased rapidly since then in Wuhan. On January 19, 2020,6 the rst case reported in another province was a person who traveled from7 Wuhan. From January 23, 2020, a series of substantial public healthinterven8 tions including travel bans into and from Wuhan, social isolation, quarantine9 and wearing face masks, have been implemented in Wuhan and subsequently10 other cities in China such as all 9 localities have successively launched the11 rst-level response to major public health emergencies. As of February 2012 (at the time of writing), there have been 75,567 con rmed cases and the13 death toll stands at 2239 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), 2-fold greater than what14 was reported ten days ago, and greatly surpasses the infections and tolls15 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak16 in 2003.17 For early assessment of the epidemic potential of COVID-19 outbreak18 and potential e ects of government and public health intervention, it ises19 sential to quantify the epidemiological parameters in real-time from a time20 series data. Using the earlier phase of outbreak data, the basicreproduc21 tion number R0 has been estimated to be somewhere between 2.2 to 4.0 in22 Wuhan[2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In practice, it becomes crucial to monitorquan23 titative changes in transmission rates and the e ective reproduction number24 Rt over time to reveal the impacts of control measures[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The25 transmissibility depends on the biological properties of the coronavirus, as26 well as the contact patterns which can be intervened at the national or social27 levels in populations. The dynamic changes in transmissibility of COVID-1928 in Wuhan and across provinces in China remain unknown. Wehypothe29 sized that there could be a signi cant reduction of transmissibility with time30 which is in accordance with the public health interventions in Wuhan and31 other provinces.32 Here we provide a real-time model-based analysis to estimate trends in33 transmissibility of COVID-19 from January 20 to February 13 in Wuhan,34 Hubei and other 28 provinces in China and forecast the turning point to35 reach a potential outbreak plateau based on the surveillance case counts as36 well as transportation and population immigration data from Wuhan to other37 cities. Our method, without relying on an assumption of epidemiological38 parameters for disease progression which is absent for the novel pathogen in39 our study, is a exible and generalizable approach to directly estimate the40 distribution of the transmissibility trend.41 2. Methods42 2.1. Sources of Data43 We obtained the number of COVID-19 con rmed cases of time series data44 between January 20, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in China from the o cial45 websites of the National Health Commission of China and Provincial Health46 Committees (http://www.nhc.gov.cn). The data of cases for each of the47 28 provinces (24 provinces plus 4 municipalities including Beijing, Shanghai,48 Chongqing and Tianjin) at 23 time points were included, as well as for Wuhan49 and major cities in Hubei. The start date of January 20 was chosen because50 the o cial diagnostic protocol released by WHO on January 17 allows the51 new COVID-19 cases to be diagnosed accurately and rapidly. The end date52 of February 13 was chosen is because the diagnosis criteria for Wuhan and53 Hubei province were changed to include those identi ed by clinic diagnosis54 since February 13. All cases in our study were laboratory-con rmed with the55 detection of viral nucleic acid following the case de nition by the National56 Health Commission of China.57 Wuhan is connected to other cities in China via high-speed railway,high58 way, and airplane ights. Population mobility statistics to estimate theex59 posed sizes in cities outside Wuhan were based on transport-related databases60 below: 1) Railway and airline travel data: the daily numbers of outbound61 high-speed trains from Wuhan with corresponding travelling hours wereob62 tained from the high-speed rail network (http://shike.gaotie.cn) fromDecem63 ber 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020., and similarly daily numbers of outbound64 ight and hours for air transport were obtained from the Citytrip network65 (https://www.ctrip.com) from December 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020. We66 calculated daily travelling hours which equal to the product of the outbound67 trip counts and the travelling hours for rail and air transport respectively68 from Wuhan to each major city. For a given province, we summarized the69 total number of travelling hours across all cities in that province. 2) Highway70 mileage data: we collected highway mileage data from bus station networks at71 https://www.qichezhan.cn. It contains the highway mileage from Wuhan to72 16 cities in the Hubei Province. 3) Migration data: we obtained population73 migration data from the Baidu Migration Map (http://qianxi.baidu.com)74 which includes the rate of migration among the population leaving Wuhan75 to other cities and provinces from January 1 to 28, 2020. Total travelling76 hours for rail and air ight, and migration scales are plotted by the province77 in Figure 1. Accumulated time on trains, on airplanes, highway mileage and78 population migration scales were used to model the underlying epidemic sizes79 in the provinces or cities outside Wuhan at the time 0 of this study which is80 on January 20, 2020.81 From Figure 1, we observed that Guandong has the largest traveling hours82 through railway and airplane outbound from Wuhan among the provinces.83 Also, the largest population has immigrated from Wuhan to Henan. In Hubei84 province, Cities of Huanggan and Xiaogan are the closest to Wuhan in terms85 of mileage and the scale of migration. These simple observations areconsis86 tent with our result that Guandong, Henan, Huanggan and Xiaogan have the87 largest number of estimated primary infected cases imported from Wuhan on88 January 20, 2020.89 2.2.

Another is that the infection happens in local area, hence the97 number of trains or planes has more information than the population taking98 trains or planes. In addition, in Hubei province, most people left Wuhan by99 cars, we use RMk as one of measurement for the spatial distance between100 city k and Wuhan.101 2.2.1. Modeling for 28 provinces102 First, we build an index k to represent the baseline infected cases in103 province k on 20 January, 2020. Particularly, we will use T Rk; F Lk and M Ik104 to measure the relationship between provice k and Wuhan.

We hence make assumptions as least as possible.109 With the notations de ned above, it is obvious that the average new cases110 in province k at day t is ktWkt. We then assume a Poisson distribution for111 the new cases diagnosed in province k at day t with mean ktWkt, that isdYktYktYk;t 1P ossionp ktWktq;(2)112 where ` ' means `distributed as'.113 Under the uni ed leadership of the central goverment, we suppose the114 trend of kt over day t is the same for 28 provinces, that is, kt t is115 independent of k so thatkttk;t 1:116 To avoid strong assumptions about the evolution of the epidemic, we allow117 t to be arbitray function of t.

Modeling for Hubei and Wuhan131 The modeling and the loglikelihood function for Hubei are similar with132 those for 28 provinces except that F Lk is replaced by RMk and provinces are133 replaced by cities, because there are not ights between the cities in Hubei134 and Wuhan, and the most people leave Wuhan by cars or buses.

Table170 1 displays the resulting estimators for . Rail transportation and migration171 from Wuhan had signi cant e ects on number of infectious on January, 20 so172 the epidemiological scale (p-value 0:015 and p-value 0:02, respectively),173 but not for air transportation (p-value 1:0).174 Figure 2(a) displays the transmission rates k1 on January 20, 2020 by175 province and Figure 2(c) displays the ratio of transmission rate t over day t.176 Since kt k1 \u00b1tj 2 j and the ratio of transmission rate t are the same over177 28 provinces, the initial transmission rates k1 can be used to compare the178 strength of the prevention and control for the NCP epidemic in 28 provinces.179 The transmission rates k1 varied greatly by province, from 0:58 to 0:98 for180 Beijing and Heilongjiang, respectively.181 Figure 2(b) displays the underlying infected cases k on January 20, 2020.182 The top ve provinces with the highest number of cases were in Guangdong,183 Henan, Beijing, Sichuan and Hunan respectively, and the lowest numbers184 were in Ningxia, Jilin, Hainan and Heilongjiang.185 Those with the highest imported cases k did not necessarily exhibit the186 highest transmission rate k1. For instance, Beijing and Sichuan had the187 highest underlying cases but low transmisison rates (0:58 and 0:65 inFig188 ure 2(a)); on the contrary, Heilongjiang and Jilin had the lowest underlying189 cases but high infection rates (0:83 0:98 in Figure 2(a)). Interestingly, this190 might be in accordance with the e ects implemented in each province;Bei191 jing and Sichuan are known for their substantial and immediate public health192 intervention starting on January 20, 2020.193 Figure 2(d) displays the Rt and 95% con dence intervals (CI).

We alsocalEst.SDp-value196 culate R~t from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008)[16]. The shape of Rt and R~t197 are concordant, whereas R~t dramatically uctuated in the begining.198 We further predicted the number of accumulated cases until March for199 each province using the optimal model we chose above (Figure 3 andSupple200 mentary Figures 2 and 3). For almost all provinces, observed values perfectly201 fall within 95% CI of the prediction band, suggesting a good tting, except202 a few cases. For example, the predicted numbers were somewhat larger than203 the observed values in Bejing, which could be due to an over-estimation of204 the underlying case at the baseline. Given no changes in the current control205 measures, we observed that the predicted numbers reached a plateau from206 February 19 to 24 in all provinces (Figure 3(i)), marked by a blue line with207 the date of turning point labeled in each plot.001080040204310t 2_R20 in each province; (b) the estimated underlying infected cases on January 20 in eachprovince; (c) the estimated ratio of transmission rate over time; (d) Sequential estimationof reproduction number from the daily COVID-19 cases.215 Table 1 displays the resulting estimators for . Highway transportation216 and migration from Wuhan have signi cant e ects on number of infectious217 on January, 20 so the epidemiological scale (p-value 0:036 and p-value218 4e 04, respectively), but not for rail transportation (p-value 1:0). This219 is di erent from the conclusion for 28 provinces where rail transportation is220 signi cant. This may be attributed to that the cities in Hubei is close to221 Wuhan and the popular transportation leaving Wuhan is by cars.222 Figure 4(a) displays the transmission rates k1 on January 20, 2020 by223 city and Figure 4(c) displays the ratio of transmission rate t over day t.224 The transmission rates k1 varied by city, from 0:45 to 0:80 for Enshi and225 Suizhou, respectively, except for Shennongjia which is a scenic area. The top226 two cities with the highest transmission rates were in Suizhou and Huangshi,227 and the lowest transmission rates were in Shennongjia and Enshi.228 Figure 4(b) displays the underlying infected cases k on January 20, 2020.229 The top two cities with the highest number of cases were in Xiaogan and230 Huanggang, and the lowest numbers were in Qianjiang and Tianmen.231 Again, those with higher imported cases k did not necessarily exhibit232 higher transmission rate k1. For instance, although Suizhou, Huangshi and233 Ezhou had lower underlying cases (6:06 7:50) but the highest transmission234 rate (0:74 0:80); on the contrary, Enshi had higher underlying cases (9:12)235 but lower transimission rates (0:48 in Figure 4(a)).236 Figure 4(d) displays the Rt and its 95% CI. The reproduction number237 decreased dramatically to 0:97 on January 22, 2020, then increased to 3:70238 on January 27, 2020 and decreased to 1 on February 5.239 As the diagnosis criteria for Wuhan and Hubei province expanded to240 include those identi ed by clinic diagnosis since February 13, the reported241 cases increased dramatically since then. As our model was initially built up242 using the laboratory-con rmed cases, the predicted cases were not presented243 after February 13 (Supplementary Figure 5). However, the estimated trend,244 without changes in other parameters, was still informative to predict the245 turning point.

The reproduction number R decreasedtgreatly from 4:9 to 2 in 3 days, remained stable till January 28, and thencontinuously decreased to 1 at February 2. In our prediction model, theobserved cases were within the prediction band before February 13. Due to256 the changes of diagnosis criteria, the predicted cases were not comparable257 after February 13. However, as mentioned above, the estimated trend was258 still informative to predict the turning point. Thus we estimate that the date259 of containment would be around February 29, 2020 in Wuhan (Figure 5(c)).Wuhan1.10.19.08.t_ 70ta .0e 6.05.04.03.0654t 3_R2100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 32 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u22121 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u22120 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 02 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 02 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2(a)1\u22122020\u221201\u221221 2020\u221201\u221225 2020\u221201\u221229 2020\u221202\u221202 2020\u221202\u221206 2020\u221202\u221210Date(b)2020\u221202\u2212292020\u221201\u221220 2020\u221201\u221227 2020\u221202\u221203 2020\u221202\u221210 2020\u221202\u221217 2020\u221202\u221224 2020\u221203\u221202Date(c)4. Discussions261 Here we described transmission dynamic patterns of the COVID-19out262 break using time-serial data in Wuhan and 29 provinces in China fromJan263 uary 20 to February 13, 2020. The instantaneous Rt declined from the range264 of 4 to 5 towards 1, from January 21 to February 2 in Wuhan, while there was265 an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other266 provinces. The ratio for transmission rates decreased dramatically fromJan267 uary 23 to 27, likely due to the rigorous public health intervention beginning268 on January 23, 2020. Model prediction results suggested that COVID-19269 would be contained in provinces from February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date270 of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.271 The temporal distributions for Rt give a basis for assessing the evolution272 of transmissibility over time[15, 16, 22]. For Hubei and other provinces, there273 was an initial growth from January 21 to 27, 2020 with Rt up to 4 followed274 by a decline in a short period. The increase in Rt was in accordance with275 the increase in transmission, but at a slower rate. There was a dramatically276 declining trend in the ratio for the transmission rate from January 23 to 28.277 Since January 23, 2020, the Chinese government banned travels into and from278 Wuhan by air, rail and road access to halt the spread of cases from Wuhan279 to other cities. Also, almost all provinces initiated the highest level of public280 health emergency responses during January 23 and 25 including tracking and281 isolating close contacts with COVID-19 patients, self-quarantine, etc. We282 speculate that, based on the coincidence of a series of intervention e ects,283 the decline in Rt could be due to a series of intervention measures to reduce284 the transmission rate implemented since January 23, 2020.285 For Wuhan, the reproduction number Rt showed a trend of decline in286 general from 4:9 to 1 on February 2, 2020, although a slight shift upward287 on January 27 and 28. Di erent from other places, the outbreak in Wuhan288 could be in earlier January with sparse data. In our study, the initial Rt289 was estimated at 4:9 on January 21 and even higher at 8:13 before this date290 (data not shown), larger than the estimation in other places as expected. We291 also observed that the ratio for transmission rates decreased from January292 28 in Wuhan, suggesting the intervention starting on January 23 might have293 lag e ects on the transmission rates. Several studies have estimated the294 basic reproduction number R0 in a range of 2.2 to 4.0 in Wuhan[2, 3, 11, 12],295 highly contagious compared to SARS[13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. One study[13]296 estimated Rt in 830 cases in Wuhan from December 24 and January 23 and297 found that Rt decreased from 8 to 2.52. The trend is similar to what we298 observed; however, with the interaction involved, we estimated Rt declined299 and approached the critical threshold at 1 on February 2, 2020.300 The di erence in transmission rates among di erent provinces highlights301 the importance of its contact patterns and control measures, given nore302 quired immunity obtained in the early outbreak phase[4, 18]. As of January303 20, underlying cases imported from Wuhan were the highest in Guangdong,304 Henan, Beijing and Sichuan. Beijing and Sichuan had the lowesttransmis305 sion rates (ranging from 0.58 to 0.65), and Heilongjiang, Jilin and Tianjin306 had the lowest underlying cases but high transmission rates (0.83 to 0.98).307 This could be related to the extent of e orts in each province to reduce the308 number of contacts in the transmission process, particularly challenging for309 those with the highest number of cases. It was reported a high sensitivity of310 the timing of implementation of control for SARS, a 1-week delay inimple311 mentation of control measures results in a 2.6-fold increase in mean epidemic312 size[16]. Thus the immediate stringent controls measures have critical impact313 to prevent the spread of diseases.314 We forecasted that COVID-19 will be contained across provinces around315 February 19 to 24, and in Wuhan one week later. The model tting to the316 data performed very well for all regions as shown by the observed casesgener317 ally falling in the 95% CI of the bound of prediction in the plots. Zhejiang and318 Guizhou provinces showed statistical anomalies with the largest predictorer319 ror (Supplementary Figure 3); the observed cases were either underestimated320 or overestimated. This could be due to the variation in the duration of the321 infectious period or the number of underlying case estimation at baseline as322 the transport data we have might not be completed, which warrant further323 investigation.324 The estimation of the traditional SIR or SEIR models[29, 30, 31, 32, 33]325 requires information about the epidemiological parameters of diseaseprogres326 sion, which is absent for the novel pathogen in our study. Studies, forex327 ample, used serial interval estimates based on previous estimations ofSARS328 Cov[2, 3, 12]. It would be desirable to estimate them from the model itself.329 The likelihood-based method modelling presented here can be used for this330 purpose in real-time estimations of epidemiological parameters, withmini331 mal assumptions. We assumed secondary cases are generated according to a332 Poisson distribution[22, 34]. Our method relies on the inference oftransmis333 sion among the underlying statistical distribution of the infected cases during334 the infectious period. It can be used to provide statistical expectations for335 new case predictions. Large time-series data permit us to estimate the rates336 on a daily basis. Thus, for the calculations in this study, we choose to use a337 minimal statistical approach for emerging infectious diseases which is more338 appropriate and generalizable.339 Our study is not without limitations. First, our results are based on the340 diagnosis cases reported by the CDC in China. Underreporting is likely to341 occur which was not accounted for in our analysis. Among all cases reported342 until February 11, only 13:8% cases were reported prior January 20, 2020343 and among them, 77:6% were among the Hubei province[35]. Since we are344 most interested in the temporal trend after January 20, the underreporting345 might not vary greatly with time since then. Second, as there is a series346 of interventions implemented during subsequent periods, we were not able347 to distinguish which intervention could be the main driver based on current348 data. Third, due to the changes in diagnosis, the diagnosed cases increased349 dramatically up to 14840 in Wuhan and Hubei from February 12, which350 makes our prediction challenging. Thus we did not provide the predicted351 cases for Wuhan and Hubei province after February 13, 2020.352 In summary, we provide transmission dynamic patterns of theCOVID353 19 outbreak using time-serial data from January 20 to February 13, 2020 in354 China. The declining trend of Rt, as well as ratio for transmission rates,355 indicate the e ects of public health intervention implemented by thegov356 ernment beginning on January 23, 2020. Model prediction results suggested357 that COVID-19 would be contained in provinces around 19 to 24 February,358 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.359 Declaration of interests360We declare no competing interests.361 Acknowledgments362 The research were partially supported by National Natural ScienceFoun363 dation of China (Nos. 11931014 and 11829101) and Fundamental Research364 Funds for the Central Universities (No. JBK1806002) of China.365 References366 [1] D.

Interpretation Public health interventions implemented at both thesocial and personal levels are e ective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 inWuhan and other provinces. Using the earlier phase of outbreak data, the basicreproduc21 tion number R0 has been estimated to be somewhere between 2.2 to 4.0 in22 Wuhan[2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The dynamic changes in transmissibility of COVID-1928 in Wuhan and across provinces in China remain unknown. Wehypothe29 sized that there could be a signi cant reduction of transmissibility with time30 which is in accordance with the public health interventions in Wuhan and31 other provinces.32 Here we provide a real-time model-based analysis to estimate trends in33 transmissibility of COVID-19 from January 20 to February 13 in Wuhan,34 Hubei and other 28 provinces in China and forecast the turning point to35 reach a potential outbreak plateau based on the surveillance case counts as36 well as transportation and population immigration data from Wuhan to other37 cities. Our method, without relying on an assumption of epidemiological38 parameters for disease progression which is absent for the novel pathogen in39 our study, is a exible and generalizable approach to directly estimate the40 distribution of the transmissibility trend.41 2. For a given province, we summarized the69 total number of travelling hours across all cities in that province. Accumulated time on trains, on airplanes, highway mileage and78 population migration scales were used to model the underlying epidemic sizes79 in the provinces or cities outside Wuhan at the time 0 of this study which is80 on January 20, 2020.81 From Figure 1, we observed that Guandong has the largest traveling hours82 through railway and airplane outbound from Wuhan among the provinces.83 Also, the largest population has immigrated from Wuhan to Henan. In Hubei84 province, Cities of Huanggan and Xiaogan are the closest to Wuhan in terms85 of mileage and the scale of migration. Modelling the transmissibility of COVID-1990 We introduce the main notation here. In addition, in Hubei province, most people left Wuhan by99 cars, we use RMk as one of measurement for the spatial distance between100 city k and Wuhan.101 2.2.1. Particularly, we will use T Rk; F Lk and M Ik104 to measure the relationship between provice k and Wuhan. There194 production number increased to 2:15 at January 26 and declined to 1 on195 February 1, then graduately decreased to 0:26 at February 13. Model prediction results suggested that COVID-19269 would be contained in provinces from February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date270 of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan.271 The temporal distributions for Rt give a basis for assessing the evolution272 of transmissibility over time[15, 16, 22]. We291 also observed that the ratio for transmission rates decreased from January292 28 in Wuhan, suggesting the intervention starting on January 23 might have293 lag e ects on the transmission rates. One study[13]296 estimated Rt in 830 cases in Wuhan from December 24 and January 23 and297 found that Rt decreased from 8 to 2.52. As of January303 20, underlying cases imported from Wuhan were the highest in Guangdong,304 Henan, Beijing and Sichuan.

Underreporting is likely to341 occur which was not accounted for in our analysis. Third, due to the changes in diagnosis, the diagnosed cases increased349 dramatically up to 14840 in Wuhan and Hubei from February 12, which350 makes our prediction challenging. 11931014 and 11829101) and Fundamental Research364 Funds for the Central Universities (No. A pneumonia outbreak associated383 with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin, Nature (2020) 1{4.384 [6] D.
