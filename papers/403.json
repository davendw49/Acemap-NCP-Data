Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can e ectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the e ect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.", "text": "          of Coronaviridae [                    province and the seventh largest city of People\u2019s Republic of China [                    Since 31 December 2019, when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported 27 cases ofviral pneumonia, including 7 critically ill cases, the pneumonia outbreak has received considerableglobal attention. A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent by the Chinese authoritieson 7 January 2020, and on 10 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the novelcoronavirus as 2019-nCoV.

Likelihood-Based EstimatesLikelihood-based estimation of Rc during the outbreak in Wuhan gives a mean value of 6.39 withmean and variance of generation time of 6 and 2 days on the basis of a revised data series (dataRev1).The reproduction number based on likelihood-based estimation ranges from 1.66 to 10 and it followsfrom Table 2 that Rc is sensitive to changes in mean generation intervals. Fitting to the other reviseddata series (dataRev2) gives a mean value of 6.32 with mean and variance of generation time of 6and 2 days. Note that the estimates of Rc based on the two time series agree well, and consequently,both revised data series can be used to fit the proposed dynamics transmission model. In this study,we chose the estimations based on dataRev1 as the comparison reference to verify and validate ourmodel-based estimation. Thus, in the following sections of the manuscript, we will use the reviseddataset (dataRev1) to fit the proposed model.3.2.

Themean control reproduction number was estimated to be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23), in          numbers using di erent methods (likelihood-based and model-based approaches). The mean controlreproduction number was estimated to be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23), in comparison withthe values of the SARS epidemics (R0 = 4.91) in Beijing, China, in 2003 [                    reproduction number is consistent with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three\u2013fourgenerations of transmission in the period covered by this study [                    estimation. According to the current report, the incubation period of Wuhan patients with coronaviruspneumonia is about 2 to 15 days. We then assume that the serial interval follows the gamma distributionwith varying mean and variance, which allows us to examine the influence on the reproduction number.With the distribution of serial interval with mean 6 days and variance 2 days, the likelihood-basedestimation of the reproduction number is consistent with the model-based estimation. It shows thatlonger serial intervals induce greater reproduction numbers, and hence, more new infections, whichfurther confirms that the epidemic may be more serious than what has been reported until now [          Based on the reported data, we have estimated that the number of people who were identifiedthrough contact tracing and quarantined was 5897, as of 22 January 2020. In comparison with thetotal population size of Wuhan, the e ort of close contact tracing and quarantine was insu cient andappears to have a limited impact in terms of reducing the number of infected cases and/or slowing downthe epidemic. The contour plot of R_c = 1 gives the threshold values of contact rate and quarantinerate for a city to avoid an outbreak. This high threshold rate of quarantine puts an extremely highrequirement for the city\u2019s public health infrastructure and its citizens\u2019 adherence to personal protectiveand public health interventions, including a reduction of transmission-e ective contacts, separationand restriction during the quarantine.imported cases from the epicenter is minimal, speaking in terms of the value of the travel restriction.A strict travel restriction to the city of Wuhan is expensive and resource-consuming, imposing asubstantial challenge to the decision- and policy-makers and the city\u2019s resilience. Moreover, such ameasure could only delay the transmission of the infectious disorder.on a combination of e ective quarantine and reduction of contact within the city.the travel restriction strategy by other regions and provinces, the introduction of new detectiontechnologies, etc.), the present model needs to be revised in that the basic reproduction numberestimated here is no longer suitable for predicting future epidemic trends (Table 4). This will be theaim of a forthcoming article.Date01/2387686886283001/24126612071163128701/25182816241480197501/26263421281802274401/27378427362120451501/28541934642430597401/297723433527317711ranging from 2.0 to 4.9. Currently, a fourth large-scale outbreak is occurring and spreading out fromWuhan, Hubei province, China, to neighboring provinces and other countries. There is a dearthof epidemiological data about the emerging coronavirus, which would be of crucial importance todesign and implement timely, ad hoc e ective public health interventions, such as contact tracing,quarantine and travel restrictions. In this study, we adopted a deterministic model to shed light on thetransmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus and assess the impact of public health interventionson infection. We found that the basic reproduction number could be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71\u20137.23),which seems consistent with the special period prior to the Spring Festival when contacts were higherthan usual, and with the opinion that the virus has gone through at least three\u2013four generations. It isworth mentioning that our model made a very good prediction of the confirmed cases from 23 to 29January 2020, as shown in Table 4. Particularly, the predicted confirmed cases should be 7723 as of 29January 2020, which is very close to the real number of cases of 7711. Furthermore, according to ourmodel, the outbreak, under the most restrictive measures, is expected to peak within two weeks (since23 January 2020), with a significant low peak value. Our investigation has major practical implicationsfor public health decision- and policy-makers. The rather high reproduction number suggests thatthe outbreak may be more serious than what has been reported so far, given the particular season ofincreasing social contacts, warranting e ective, strict public health measures aimed to mitigate theburden generated by the spreading of the new virus.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, S.T., Y.X. and J.W.; methodology, S.T., Y.X. and J.W.; software, B.T.,X.W., Q.L. and S.T.; validation, S.T., Y.X. and J.W.; formal analysis, B.T., X.W., Q.L. and S.T.; investigation, S.T.,Y.X. and J.W.; resources, B.T., X.W., Q.L. and S.T.; data curation, B.T., X.W., Q.L. and S.T.; writing\u2014original draftpreparation, B.T., X.W., Q.L., N.L.B. and S.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, N.L.B., S.T., Y.X. and J.W.; visualization,J.W.; supervision, J.W.; project administration, J.W.; funding acquisition, J.W.
