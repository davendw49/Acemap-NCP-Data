The generation of COVID-19-specific antibodies is essential for suchtasks. Here we report that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated byimmunizing animals with synthetic peptides corresponding to different areas ofNucleoprotein (N) of COVID-19. The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies wereassessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS.Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections fromCOVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool. A Sandwich ELISA kit wasquickly assembled for quantitation of the virus/NP of COVID-19 concentrations in thevaccine preparations. Development of POCT is also aggressively undergoing.Immunohistochemistry, Sandwich ELISA, POCT.        Recently, a novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, broke out from Wuhan, China, had spreadrapidly around the country and now the rest of world. The pneumonia symptoms manifestedby this virus are similar to that of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which lead to acuterespiratory syndrome. Until Feb 1        COVID-19 contains Nucleoprotein (N-protein), Spike glycoprotein (S-protein), Envelopeprotein (E-protein) and Membrane protein (M-protein)9. Ideally, developing antibody againstthe S protein will be the best approach since S plays very important roles in virus entering bybinding to the target receptor on the cell surface. However, S protein is a heavily glycosylatedprotein10 and many groups have tried to express the COVID-19 S protein in mammalian cellswith limited success. On the other hand, N-protein is produced at very high levels in the virusinfected cells and is considered to be a good candidate for clinic diagnosis11.Based on our past success experiences of generating neutralizing monoclonal antibodiesagainst EV71 virus and human DKK2 using synthetic peptides as immunogens12,13, weidentified a few sequences in COVID-19\u2019s NP that could be linear epitopes with promisingantigenicity on the outer surfaces of NP. In this report, we present that, in events like thisoutbreak of COVID-19 virus, using synthetic peptides as immunogens may offer us a way todevelop serological diagnostic tools in a timely manner. Our work also demonstrated that byworking closely with scientists, clinicians, biotechnology contract research organization (CRO),IVD manufactures companies, NGOs and many different government agencies, together wecould quickly translate the genomic information of emerging pathogens to many usefulresearch and diagnostic tools to combat the deadly diseases such as the on-going globalcrisis of OCVID-19 virus.Peptides were synthesized at DentriPro Bioscientific Ltd. Each peptide was chemicallylinked to the carrier protein mcKLH through a sulfide-linker.Balb/c mice and New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with KLH-conjugatedsynthetic peptides. Bleeds were tested for titers against unconjugated peptides and purifiedNP by ELISA.Splenocytes from the immunized mice were fused with the mouse myeloma cell lineSP2/0 and cultural supernatant from individual hybridoma clones were screened against NPby ELISA. Bulk mAbs were produced using stationary bioreactors. The concentrations ofpurified IgG were determined by their absorbance at OD280.Wells were coated with 1\u03bcg/mL of un-conjugated peptides or recombinant protein, blockedwith 5% skim-milk/PBS, and incubated with bleeds or culture supernatants, then probed withHRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. After final washes, HRP substrate TMB solution was addedand absorbencies were determined at 450nm with a microplate reader.Recombinant NPs from COVID-19, SARS and MERS were provided by Chinese CDC and Inst.of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Science. Proteins were electrophoresed using 12%SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5%non-fat milk for 2 h, then stained with primary antibodies for 1h, then detected withHRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 50 min. After final wash, the blots were analyzedusing SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Life Technologies).Following Novolink Polymer\u2019s instruction, dewaxed lung tissue sections were immersed in0.3% H2O2 to reduce the background of endogenous peroxidase, incubated with the primaryantibodies for 60 min at 37 \u00b0C, treated with enhancer for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, then probed withHRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 mins at 37 \u00b0C. The DAB substrate was used todevelop the color, followed by counter-staining and dehydrating the sections. The sectionswere examined under microscope.For Sandwcih ELISA, as described previously14,15, each well was coated with different rabbitanti-COVID-19 NP pAbs and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS. Samples were diluted in 3%BSA-PBS and incubated in the wells for 1 h, probed with the Biotin-conjugated rabbitanti-COVID-19 NP pAbs diluted in 3% BSA-PBS, then detected with HRP-Streptavidin. Afterwashes, chromogenic HRP substrate TMB was added and the reaction was stopped with 0.1For RICA, Anti-COVID-19 NP rabbit pAb (Pept-4) was dispensed on a nitrocellulosemembrane as a \u201ctest\u201d (T) line, and goat anti-rabbit IgG was fixed as a \u201ccontrol\u201d (C) line.Quantum Dots (QD) pre-coated with a layer of silica were covalently conjugated with theAnti-COVID-19 NP rabbit pAb (Pept-3) and distributed on a glass fiber. The sample pad,conjugate pad, nitrocellulose membrane, and absorbent pad were attached to a laminationpad and cut to fit in a plastic cartridge. Sera were diluted with Tris buffer containing 1%NP-40 and two drops of the sample were loaded to the test strip and wait for 15 minutesthen scanned with SkanFlexi X200 with the associated software to calculate theconcentration of the antigen based on the intensities the T and C lines.antibodiesDesign and synthesis of peptides as immunogens for generation of COVID-19-specifcNPs of coronavirus are shared with very high homology between all seven coronaviruses.Cross-reactivity among NPs of human coronaviruses were reported by Yu\u2019s group16. In thisstudy, 5 linear sequences, SDNGPQSNQRNAPRITFG (Pept-1,a.a.2-19),PSDSTGSNQNGERSGARSKQ (Pept-2, a.a.20-39), PGSSRGTSPARMAGNGGDAALA (Pept-3,a.a.199-220), PKKDKKKKADETQALPQRQKK (Pept-4, a.a.368-388) and GGSADSTQA (Pept-5,a.a.413-419) were selected as the potential linear epitopes on the outer surfaces ofCOVID-19 NP.Normally, the rotations/conformations of the very ends of proteins are more close to the onesof the synthetic peptides so the antibodies generated with synthetic peptides corresponding tothe NT and CT of the target protein have higher possibilities to bind to the native target proteins.Pept-1 (SDNGPQSNQRNAPRITFG) is located at the very end of N terminal and Pept-5(GGSADSTQA, a.a.413-419) are the last 9 amino acids of COVID-19 NP. Pept-1 shares 88.9%identify with the SARS NP, and no homology to the MERS\u2019 and the other 4 coronaviruses\u2019 NP.Pept-5 is 100% identical in COVID-19 and SARS, no homology with the rest 5 viruses. Theother three sequences were selected based more on the specificity and immunogenicityother than the locations in the protein. Pept-2 has only 70% identity to SARS\u2019s in amino acidcomposition but are not in continued sequence and the antibodies generated by Pept-2 willhave the highest possibility to be COVID-19 specific. Pept-3 has 77% homology with SARS and50% identity to MERS at the very end of NT of the peptide. Pept-4 has the strongestimmunogenicity and its NT has very high homology with both SARS and MERS.Generations of pAbs and mAbs to COVID-19 NP.Five groups of mice, 3 mice per group, were immunized with the 5 KLH-peptidesrespectively. On day 12, the tail bleeds were collected and examined by ELISA against boththe corresponding peptides and the full length COVID-19 NP. As shown in Table 1-1, themice immunized with Pept-4-KLH not only generated strong immune responses against theimmunizing peptide, but also developed antibodies bound to COVID-19 NP. On day 13, thespleenocytes were isolated from the immunized mice and fused with SP2/0 mouse myelomacells to generate mouse hybridoma cells.Weak immune reactions against corresponding peptides were observed with miceimmunized with Pept-1-KLH or Pept-3-KLH but no significant reactions with the full lengthCOVID-19 protein were observed. Immunization with Pept-2-KLH and Pept-5-KLH failed toinduce any significant immunization responses at such short time of period.Started the same time, three groups of New Zealand White rabbits (two each) wereimmunized with Pept-2-KLH, Pept-3-KLH and Pept-4-KLH respectively. On day 21, sera wereexamined against the NP by ELISA. As shown in Table 1-2, similar to what been observed inmice, rabbits immunized with Pept-4-KLH generated the best immune responses against theCOVID-19 NPs, while moderate antibody titers were also observed in rabbits immunizedwith Pept-2-KLH and Pept-3-KLH. All animals\u2019 titers increased significantly from day 21 to day28, but some reached plateau after day 28. Polyclonal antibodies were purified using ProteinA column for preparation of conjugations and pairing.On day 21, culture supernatants from 752 stable monoclonal hybridomas were screenedagainst NPs, and more than 100 positive clones were obtained. On day 25, the culturesupernatants not only were tested for the stable productions of monoclonal ant-COVID-19NP antibodies but also examined their cross-reactivity towards the NPs from SARS and MERS(Partial of the data were shown in Table 1-3). As you can see, clone 6F10 mAb had thehighest titer against COVID-19\u2019s NP with minimal cross-reactivity to SARS\u2019s NP, and nosignificant reactivity to MERS\u2019s NP. On the contrary, clone 3A3 and 1F7 reacted equally wellto NPs from COVID-19, SARS and MERS. Clone 3A10 and 8C3 recognized NPs from COVID-19and SARS, but not the one from MERS. Our data suggested that even with such short ofsequence, there could be many different antigen epitopes that can generate different mAbswith different specificities.As shown in Fig.2A and 2B, tested against purified recombinant NPs from COVID-19, SARSand MERS, both rabbit pAbs (Pept-3) and mAb 6F10 (Pept-4) reacted with COVID-19 NP verywell with a clear band around 50 kDa while the rabbit pAbs showed some extend level ofcross-reactivity with NPs from SARS and MERS (recombinant MERS was GST-tagged). Mostimportantly, mouse mAb 6F10 showed very good specificity to COVID-19 NP with minimalcross-reactivity to the ones from SARS and MERS.The biopsy samples of pulmonary sarcoidosis (after ablation) were collected from patientseither confirmed with COVID-19 virus infection by RT-PCR or diagnosed with non-specificlung infection. The biopsy samples were stained with anti-COVID-19 pAbs (Pept-2). As shownin Fig. 2C and 2D, under the microscope view (400X), there were four cells with verydistinguish dark-brown staining in the COVID-19 infected patient\u2019s biopsy tissue. The stainingwas evenly distributed in the cytosol with inclusion body appearances. No nuclear staining.Those four stained cells were located inside the alveolar cavity, and look like macrophages.No brown staining was observed in the negative control sample from the patient withDevelopment of Sandwich ELISA and rapid immunochromatographic assaysThe 96-well plate were coated with different NP pAbs, and paired with different Biotin-labeledNP pAbs. The best combination was coating with anti-COVID-19 NP pAbs (Pept-3) and paired withBiotinylated anti-COVID-19 NP pAbs (Pept-4).A Sandwich ELISA kit was quickly assembled for quantitation of inactivated COVID-19NP/virus concentration in vaccine. The assay kit had a limit of detection around 100ng/mLwith a linear range between 200-1600ng/mL (see Fig. 3A).To race against the time, more than 6 different immunochromatographic technologyplatforms were attempted, including Quantumimmuno-chromatographic assay (MICA). As shown in Fig. 3B, the limit of detection ofQD-based ICT was about 10ng/mL. Further improvement of detection sensitivity from manydifferent aspects has been aggressively pursuing.In this report, we demonstrated that, in event like this outbreak when only the genesequence information was available, we could design and synthesis the peptides as theimmunogens to quickly generate both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies fordevelopment of diagnostic tools against the emerging diseases. Polyclonal anti-COVID-19 NPantibodies were successfully used as pathology tool for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. TheSandwich ELISA kit has been used to help the vaccine developers to monitor the virusexpression levels in the cultures in the process of optimization of manufacture parameters.ML, FF, CW, QYW, STG contributed the antibody generation and characterization.
