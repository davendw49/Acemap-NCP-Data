Existing evidence haveconfirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. We retrospectivelycollected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at six departments fromZhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. In our study, we found N95 respirators,disinfection and hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection inmedical staffs. Our results call for re-emphasizing strict occupational protection codein battling this novel contagious disease. The risk of 2019-nCoV infection was higherin the open area than in the quarantined area. N95 may be more effective for2019-nCoV infections.Cases of a novel type of contagious pneumonia were first discovered a month ago inWuhan. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Chinese healthauthorities have determined and announced that a novel coronavirus (CoV), denotedas 2019-nCoV, had caused this pneumonia outbreak.1,2 Existing evidence haveconfirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV.3We retrospectively collected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at sixdepartments (Respiratory, ICU, Infectious Disease, Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Surgery,Trauma and Microsurgery, and Urology) from Zhongnan Hospital of WuhanUniversity. Medical staffs in these department follow differential routines ofoccupational protection: the medical staff in departments of Respiratory, ICU, andInfectious Disease wore N95 respirators, disinfected and clean hands frequently (N95group); due to people were not enough for the knowledge of the 2019-nCoV in theseearly days of the pneumonia outbreak, the medical staff in the other three departmentswore no medical masks, disinfected and clean hands occasionally (no-mask group).Suspicious cases of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed with chest CT and confirmedwith molecular diagnosis. In total, 28/58 ([confirmed/suspicious]) 2019-nCoVpatients have been diagnosed during the collection period. Patient exposure wassignificantly higher for the N95 group compared to no-mask group (Table 1) (Forconfirmed patients: difference: 733%; exposure odds ratio: 8.33)Among 493 medical staffs, zero out of 278 (([doctors+nurse] 56+222) from the N95group were infected by 2019-nCoV. In stark contrast, 10 out of 213 (77+136) from theno-mask group were confirmed infected (Table 1). Regardless of significantlylowered exposure, the 2019-nCoV infection rate for medical staff was significantlyincreased in the no-mask group compared to the N95 respirator group (difference:4.65%, [95% CI: 1.75%-infinite]; P<2.2e-16) (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 464.82, [95%Meanwhile, we analyzed the medical staff infection data from Huangmei People\u2019 sHospital (12 confirmed patients) and Qichun People\u2019 s Hospital (11 confirmedpatients) and have observed the similar phenomenon. None of medical staff wearingthe N95 respirators and follow frequent routines of disinfection with hand washingwere infected by 2019-nCoV.A randomized clinical trial has reported N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn byparticipants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence oflaboratory confirmed influenza.4 In our study, we found N95 respirators, disinfectionand hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in medicalstaffs. Interestingly, department with a high proportion of male doctors seem to have ahigher risk of infection. Our results call for re-emphasizing strict occupationalprotection code in battling this novel contagious disease.The risk of 2019-nCoV infection was higher in the open area than in the quarantinedarea. N95 may be more effective for 2019-nCoV infections.We declare no competing interests.
