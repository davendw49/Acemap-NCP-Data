As of 20 March 2020, cases have been reported in 166 countries/regions, including cases of human-to-human transmission around the world. The proportions of this epidemics is probably one of the largest challenges faced by our interconnected modern societies. According to the current epidemiological reports, the large basic reproduction number, R0 2:3, number of secondary cases produced by an infected individual in a population of susceptible individuals, as well as an asymptomatic period (up to 14 days) in which infectious individuals are undetectable without further analysis, pave the way for a major crisis of the national health capacity systems. Recent scientific reports have pointed out that the detected cases of COVID19 at young ages is strikingly short and that lethality is concentrated at large ages. Here we adapt a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) metapopulation mobility model to capture the spread of COVID-19. We propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences of the disease at each strata. The model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting investigation of control measures. The model is applied to the current epidemic in Spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of the national institute of statistics (INE). The results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first half of April 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities. The current estimates largely compromises the Spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive care units, from the end of March. However, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of COVID-19. Here we show by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive collapse of the Spanish national health system.", "text": "2Sg        Cgh {Ah, Ih}\u03b2A, \u03b2Ibetween patches are mostly due to the mobility of active population. On the other hand, the medical evolution of COVID-19displays strong differences across age groups [        The model incorporates the possibility of designing and evaluating the impact of contention policies to stop the propagationof SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we focus on those policies relying on global or targeted quarantine measures. They allow theselection of the optimum degree of mobility to avoid the health system crisis. Taking advantage of this possibility, we exploreseveral epidemic scenarios characterized by different contention measures promoted on March 20, and evaluate their impact onthe decrease of the epidemic prevalence and the saturation of the Spanish health system.In a nutshell, the proposed model takes into account in an stylized way three main ingredients taking place in SARS-CoV-2transmission: (i) the silent transmission of the pathogen through the young portion of the population, (ii) the large potential forthe spatial dissemination of the pathogen provided by the mobility of mature individuals, and (iii) the severe symptoms causedof COVID-19 in elderly that yields to a dramatic increase of medical and hospital demands. Thus, the model can be viewed asthree coevolving spreading processes with different spatio-temporal scales.        We propose a tailored model for the epidemic spread of COVID-19. We use a previous framework for the study of epidemicsin structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [        We introduce a set of modifications to the standard metapopulation model to account for the different states relevant for thedescription of COVID-19, and also to substitute the well-mixing with a more realistic set of contacts. Another key point is theintroduction of a differentiation of the course of the epidemics that depends on the demographic ages of the population. Thisdifferentiation is very relevant in light of the observation of a scarcely set of infected individuals at ages (< 25), and also becauseof the severe situations reported for people at older ages (> 65). Our model is composed of the following epidemiologicalcompartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infectious (A), infected (I), hospitalized to ICU (H), dead (D), andrecovered (R). Additionally, we divide the individuals in NG age strata, and suppose the geographical area is divided in N regionsor patches. Although we present the model in general form, its application to COVID-19 only makes use of the three age groupsmentioned above (NG = 3): young people (Y), with age up to 25; adults (M), with age between 26 and 65; and elderly people(O), with age larger than 65. See Figure 1 for an sketch of the compartmental epidemic model proposed.

They are built upon previouswork on Microscopic Markov-Chain Approach (MMCA) modelization of epidemic spreading dynamics [22], but which has alsobeen applied to other types of processes, e.g., information spreading and traffic congestion [        The rationale of the model is the following. Susceptible individuals get infected by contacts with asymptomatic and infectedtaugrennbtse,cwo mithe ainpfercotbeadbailtitayratige, bge.coOmncineginefxepcotesde,dt.wEoxppaotshesdeimnderivgied,uwahlsicthuranreinrteoacahseydmapttoamnaetsiccaaptearacteertagin. Trahtee firgs,t wophtiicohn iinsrequiring hospitalization in an ICU, with a certain probability g; otherwise, the individuals become recovered. While being atICU, individuals have a death probability !g, which is reached at a rate g. Finally, ICUs discharge at a rate g, leading to therecovered compartment. See Table I for a summary of the parameters of the model, and their values to simulate the spreading ofThe value of ig(t) encodes the probability that a susceptible agent belonging to age group g and patch i contracts the disease.ig(t) = (1Npg)Pig(t) + pg X Rigj Pjg(t) ;j=1where pg denotes the degree of mobility of individuals within age group g, and Pig(t) denotes the probability that those agentsget infected by the pathogen inside patch i. This way, the first term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (8) denotes the probability of contractingthe disease inside the residence patch, whereas the second term contains those contagions taking place in any of the neighboringareas. Furthermore, we assume that the number of contacts increases with the density of each area according to a monotonouslyincreasing function f . Finally, we introduce an age-specific contact matrix, C, whose elements Cgh define the fraction ofcontacts that individuals of age group g perform with individuals belonging to age group h. With the above definitions, Pig readsThe exponents represent the number of contacts made by an agent of age group g in patch i with infectious individuals \u2014compartments A and I, respectively \u2014 of age group h residing at patch j. Accordingly, the double product expresses theprobability for an individual belonging to age group g not being infected while staying in patch i.g kgif (nie =si) in Eq. (9) represents the overall number of contacts (infectious or non infectious), which increasesThe term z hwith the density of patch i following function f , and also accounts for the normalization factor zg, which is calculated as:where the effective population at patch i is given bywhich is distributed in age groups of sizezg =NX fi=1N gpg) ij + pgRjgi njg :Here we assess the performance of different containment measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19 using the mathematicalmodel. To incorporate containment policies in our formalism, we assume that a given fraction of the population 0 is isolated athome. In this sense, let us remark that parameter 0 allows us to change the level of resolution while studying the propagationof COVID-19. Namely, with 0 = 0 we recover the well-mixing assumption within the same municipality described in previoussections \u2014since active population movements promote the interaction between members from different households\u2014 whereas0 = 1 isolates the households from each other, thus constraining the transmission dynamics at the level of household rather thanmunicipality. From the former assumptions, we compute the average number of contacts of agents belonging to each group g ashkcgi = (10)hkgi + 0(1) ;where the second term in the r:h:s: encodes those contacts occurring within the household, whose size (number of individuals)is assumed to be in average.In this scenario, a relevant indicator to quantify the efficiency of the policy is the probability of one individual living in ahousehold, inside a given municipality i, without any infected individual. Assuming that containment is implemented at time tc,this quantity, denoted in the following as CHi(tc), is given by0 PNGg=1iS;g(tc) + iR;g(tc) nig 1PgN=G1 nigA ;hkgi(t) = (10 (ttc))hkgi + 0 (ttc)(1) ;pg(t) = (10 (ttc)) pg ;and Eq. (15) becomes time-dependent:where (x) is the Heaviside function, which is 1 if x > 0 and 0 otherwise. Accordingly, the mobility parameters pg change aswhich make (nig)e and zg also dependent on time, see Eqs. (10)\u2013(12).This containment strategy is introduced in the dynamical Eqs. (1)\u2013(6) by modifying Eqs. (1) and (2) for the time after tc:iS;g(t + 1) = iS;g(t)(1iE;g(t + 1) = iS;g(t)(1t;tc 0CHi(tc))(1t;tc 0CHi(tc)) ig(t) + (1ig(t)) ;CH;g(t) = iS;g(tc) 0CHi(tc) (titc) ;where we have added a new compartment CH to hold the individuals under household isolation after applying containment 0,and a;b is the Kronecker function, which is 1 if a = b and 0 otherwise. Containment also affects the average number of contacts,thus we must also update Eq. (9):Pig(t) = 1NG NY Y(1h=1 j=1A)zg(t)hkgi(t)fniesffi(t) Cgh (nnihjA);ehif(ft()t) (1I )zg(t)hkgi(t)fneff (t) Cgh nI;hi(t)isi (nihj)eff (t) :          In this subsection, we detail our parameters choice to study the current epidemic outbreak in Spain. Regarding epidemiologicalparameters, the incubation period has been reported to be 1 + 1 = 5:2 days [2] in average which, in our formalism, must bedistributed into the exposed and asymptomatic compartments. In principle, if one does not expect asymptomatic transmissions,most of this time should be spent inside the exposed compartment, thus being the asymptomatic infectious compartment totallyirrelevant for disease spreading. However, along the line of several recent works [                    Regarding the population structure in Spain, we have obtained the population distribution, population pyramid, dailypopulation flows and average household size at the municipality level from Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00b4\u0131stica [          Equations (1)\u2013(7) enable to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of COVID-19 across Spain. To check the validity of ourformalism, we aggregate the number of cases predicted for each municipality at the level of autonomous regions (comunidadesaut o\u00b4nomas), which is a first-level political and administrative division, and compare them with the number of cases daily reportedby the Spanish Health Ministry. In this sense, we compute the number of cases predicted for each municipality i at each timestep t as:NGCasesi(t) = Xg=1iR;g (t) +iH;g (t) +iD;g (t)nig(23)As our model is designed to predict the emergence of autochthonous cases triggered by local contagions and commutingpatterns, those imported infected individuals corresponding to the first reported cases in Spain are initially plugged into our modelas asymptomatic infectious agents. In addition, small infectious seeds should be also placed in those areas where anomalousoutbreaks have occurred due to singular events such as one funeral in Vitoria leading to more than 60 contagions. Overall, thetotal number of infectious seeds is 47 individuals which represents 0:2 % of the number of cases reported by March 20, 2020.Figure 2 shows that our model is able to accurately predict not only the overall evolution of the total number of cases atthe national scale but also their spatial distribution across the different autonomous regions. Moreover, the most typical trendobserved so far is an exponential growth of the number of cases, thus clearly suggesting that the disease is spreading freely inmost of the territories. Note, however, that there are some exceptions such as La Rioja or Pa\u00b4\u0131s Vasco in which some strongpolicies targeting the most affected areas were previously promoted to slow down COVID-19 propagation.          To assess the impact of containment policies, we now theoretically study the effects of tuning the isolation rate 0 controllingthe fraction of population staying at home. Figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of the individuals requiring intensive care unitswhile applying the isolation policy by March 20, 2020. Interestingly, it becomes clear that there are two different regimes. Forsmall 0 values, the observed behavior corresponds to the flattening of the epidemic curve while promoting social distancing.This way, increasing 0 leads to longer epidemic periods with much less impact within society in terms of hospitalized agents.In contrast, for large enough 0 values, the effective isolation of households allows for reducing at the same time the epidemicsize and the duration of the epidemic wave. This is mainly caused by the depletion [          Finally, we address the important health problem arising from the saturation of ICU beds. For this purpose, we study theevolution of individuals requiring intensive care units by fixing 0 = 0:80 from March 20, 2020. To quantify the overloadof ICU capacity, in Figure 4 we compare the predictions yielded by our equations with the total number of beds within eachautonomous region which we estimate as the 3% of the total number of hospital beds. There we find that the saturation ofhospitals across Spain is not uniform but strongly depends on both the current extension of the outbreak and the availableresources in each autonomous region.niggRijCghpg0We have presented a mathematical model based on a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) for the spatio-temporalspreading of COVID\u201319. The model captures human behavior features such as: the urban demography, age strata, age-structuredcontact patterns, and daily recurrent mobility flows. Importantly, the epidemiological and human characteristics present in thismodel provides with the possibility of a rapid and reliable evaluation of different containment policies.We have applied the results to the validation and projection of the propagation of COVID\u201319 in Spain. Our results revealthat, at the current stage of the epidemics, the application of stricter containment measures of social distance are urgent to avoidthe collapse of the health system. Moreover, we are close to an scenario in which the complete lockdown appears as the onlypossible measure to avoid the former situation. Other scenarios can be prescribed and analyzed after lockdown, as for examplepulsating open-closing strategies or targeted herd immunity.          The model is amenable for analytical calculations. We calculate the epidemic threshold using the next generation matrixapproach [          NG NPig = X X zghkgifiCgh njh (1where the above tensors M` for ` 2 f1; : : : ; 4g are defined as:NG Nig = X X(M1)igjh + (M2)igjh + (M3)igjh + (M4)igjhbA jA;h + bI jI;h+ O( 2) ;(M1)igjh = ij (1(M2)igjh = (1pg)zghkgifiCgh (1ph)njh(nih)epg)zghkgifiCgh Rjhiphnhj(nih)e(M3)igjh = pgRigj zghkgifj Cgh (1(M4)igjh =NX pgRigkzghkgifkCgh Rjhkphnhjk=1 (nkh)eph)njh(njh)e_iE;g =_iA;g =_I;g =iNG Ng iE;g + X X Migjh(bA jA;h + bI jI;h)g E;gig A;gih=1 j=1g A;gig I;giNg_g = XV ghhThese tensors encode the four different ways in which the epidemic interactions may take place: individuals belonging to thesame patch i = j and not moving (M1); interaction in the patch of i with individuals coming from patch j (M2); interaction inthe patch of j with individuals coming from patch i (M3); and individuals from i and j interacting at any other patch k (M4).In the next generation matrix framework, we only need to consider the epidemic compartments.

In particular, we focus on those policies relying on global or targeted quarantine measures. See Figure 1 for an sketch of the compartmental epidemic model proposed. Assuming that containment is implemented at time tc,this quantity, denoted in the following as CHi(tc), is given by0 PNGg=1iS;g(tc) + iR;g(tc) nig 1PgN=G1 nigA ;hkgi(t) = (10 (ttc))hkgi + 0 (ttc)(1) ;pg(t) = (10 (ttc)) pg ;and Eq. ( In this sense, we compute the number of cases predicted for each municipality i at each timestep t as:NGCasesi(t) = Xg=1iR;g (t) +iH;g (t) +iD;g (t)nig(23)As our model is designed to predict the emergence of autochthonous cases triggered by local contagions and commutingpatterns, those imported infected individuals corresponding to the first reported cases in Spain are initially plugged into our modelas asymptomatic infectious agents. Moreover, the most typical trendobserved so far is an exponential growth of the number of cases, thus clearly suggesting that the disease is spreading freely inmost of the territories. Forsmall 0 values, the observed behavior corresponds to the flattening of the epidemic curve while promoting social distancing. This way, increasing 0 leads to longer epidemic periods with much less impact within society in terms of hospitalized agents. In contrast, for large enough 0 values, the effective isolation of households allows for reducing at the same time the epidemicsize and the duration of the epidemic wave. Moreover, we are close to an scenario in which the complete lockdown appears as the onlypossible measure to avoid the former situation.
