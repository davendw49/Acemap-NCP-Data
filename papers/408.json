This severe presentation corresponds to the usage ofa virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By causing an earlyonset of severe symptoms, this same receptor tropism is thought to have determinedpathogenicity but also aided the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)in 20035.

Infectious virus was readily isolatedfrom throat- and lung-derived samples, but not from stool samples in spite of highvirus RNA concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active replication in thethroat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA intermediates in throat samples.samples of one same patient. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end ofsymptoms. Seroconversion occurred after 6-12 days, but was not followed by a rapiddecline of viral loads. COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.There is a close genetic relatedness between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV) and the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. The predominantexpression of ACE2 in the lower respiratory tract is believed to have determined the naturalhistory of SARS as a lower respiratory tract infection. Whereas positive SARS-CoV-2detection in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract has been described9, theseobservations do not address principal differences between SARS and COVID-19 in terms ofclinical pathology. The here-studied patients were enrolled because they acquired theirinfections upon known close contact to an index case, thereby avoiding representationalbiases due to symptom-based case definitions. All patients were treated in a single hospitalin Munich, Germany. Virological testing was done by two closely-collaborating laboratoriesusing the same standards of technology for RT-PCR and virus isolation, confirming eachother\u2019s results based on almost all individual samples. Due to extremely high congruence ofresults, all data are presented together. Only the serological data are based on results fromone laboratory. The patients are part of a larger cluster of epidemiologically-linked cases thatoccurred after January 23rd, 2020 in Munich, Germany, as discovered on January 27th(B\u00f6hmer et al., accompanying manuscript). The present study uses samples taken during theclinical course in the hospital, as well as from initial diagnostic testing before admission. Incases when this initial diagnostic testing was done by other laboratories, the original sampleswere retrieved and re-tested under the rigorous quality standards of the present study.To first understand whether the described clinical presentations are solely caused bySARSCoV-2 infection, samples from all patients were tested against a panel of typical agents ofrespiratory viral infection, including HCoV-HKU1, -OC43, -NL63, -229E; Influenza virus A andB, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Human Parainfluenza virus 1-4,Human metapneumovirus, Adenovirus, and Human bocavirus. Interestingly, no co-infectionwas detected in any patient.All patients were initially diagnosed by RT-PCR10 from oro- or nasopharyngeal swabspecimens. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients.There were no discernible differences in viral loads or detection rates when comparingnasovs. oropharyngeal swabs (Figure 1B). The earliest swabs were taken on day 1 of symptoms,with symptoms often being very mild or prodromal. All swabs from all patients taken betweendays 1 and 5 tested positive. The average virus RNA load was 6.76x105 copies per wholeswab until day 5 (maximum, 7.11X108 copies/swab). Swab samples taken after day 5 had anaverage viral load of 5.13x103 copies per swab and a detection rate of 45.95%. The lastswab sample was taken on day 22 post-onset. Average viral load in sputum was 1.18 x 106copies per mL (maximum, 6.65x108 copies per mL).Because swab samples had limited sensitivity for initial diagnosis of cases of SARS13,14, weanalyzed the first paired swab and sputum samples taken on the same occasion from sevenpatients (Table 1). All samples were taken between 2 and 4 days post-onset. In two cases,swab samples had clearly higher virus concentrations than sputum samples, as indicated bya difference greater than 3 in threshold cycle (Ct) value. The opposite was true in two otherscases, while the other 5 cases had similar concentrations in both sample types.None of 27 urine samples and none of 31 serum samples were tested positive forSARSCoV2 RNA.To understand infectivity, live virus isolation was attempted on multiple occasions fromclinical samples (Figure 1 D). Whereas virus was readily isolated during the first week ofsymptoms from a significant fraction of samples (16.66% in swabs, 83.33% in sputumsamples), no isolates were obtained from samples taken after day 8 in spite of ongoing highviral loads.Virus isolation from stool samples was never successful, irrespective of viral RNAconcentration, based on a total of 13 samples taken between days six to twelve from fourpatients. Virus isolation success also depended on viral load: samples containing <106copies/mL (or copies per sample) never yielded an isolate. For swab and sputum,interpolation based on a probit model was done to obtain laboratory-based infectivity criteriafor discharge of patients (Figures 1 E, F).High viral loads and successful isolation from early throat swabs suggested potential virusreplication in upper respiratory tract tissues. To obtain proof of active virus replication inabsence of histopathology, we conducted RT-PCR tests to identify viral subgenomicmessenger RNAs (sgRNA) directly in clinical samples. Viral sgRNA is only transcribed ininfected cells and is not packaged into virions, therefore indicating the presence ofactivelyinfected cells in samples. Viral sgRNA was compared against viral genomic RNA in the samesample. In sputum samples taken on days 4/5, 6/7, and 8/9, a time in which active replicationin sputum was obvious in all patients as per longitudinal viral load courses (see below), meannormalized sgRNA per genome ratios were ~0.4% (Figure 1G). Swabs taken up to day 5were in the same range, while no sgRNA was detectable in swabs thereafter. Together,these data indicate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the throat during the first 5 days aftersymptoms onset. No, or only minimal, indication of replication in stool was obtained by thesame method (Figure 1G).During our study we sequenced full virus genomes from all patients. A G6446A exchangewas first detected in one patient and later transmitted to other patients in the cluster(B\u00f6hmer, accompanying manuscript). In the first patient, this mutation was found in a throatswab while a sputum sample from the same day still showed the original allele, 6446G. TheSNP was analyzed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing in all sequential samples availablefrom that patient (Table 1). The presence of separate genotypes in throat swabs and sputumstrongly supported our suspicion of independent virus replication in the throat, rather thanpassive shedding there from the lung.Daily measurements of viral load in sputum, pharyngeal swabs, and stool are summarized inFigure 2. In general, viral RNA concentrations were very high in initial samples. In allpatients except one, throat swab RNA concentrations seemed to be already on the decline atthe time of first presentation. Sputum RNA concentrations declined more slowly, with a peakduring the first week of symptoms in three of eight patients. Stool RNA concentrations werealso high. Courses of viral RNA concentration in stool seemed to reflect courses in sputum inmany cases (e.g., Figure 2 A, B, C). In only one case, independent replication in theintestinal tract seemed obvious from the course of stool RNA excretion (Figure 2 D).Whereas symptoms mostly waned until the end of the first week (Table 2), viral RNAremained detectable in throat swabs well into the second week. Stool and sputum samplesremained RNA-positive over even longer periods, in spite of full resolution of symptoms.All cases had comparatively mild courses (Table 2). The two patients who showed somesigns of pneumonia were the only cases where sputum viral loads showed a late and highpeak around day 10/11, whereas sputum viral loads were on the decline by this time in allother patients (Figure 2 F,G).Seroconversion was detected by IgG and IgM immunofluorescence using cells expressingthe spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a virus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 (Table3). In early sera, taken between day 3 and 6, none of the patients showed detectableantibody. The patients monitored long enough to yield a serum sample after two weeks allshowed neutralizing antibodies, the titer levels of which did not suggest any correlation withclinical courses. Of note, case #4, with the lowest virus neutralization titer at end of week 2,seemed to shed virus from stool over prolonged time (Figure 2 D). Results on differentialrecombinant immunofluorescence assay indicated no significant rise in titer against the fourendemic human Coronaviruses (Table S1).The clinical courses in subjects under study were mild, all being young- to middle-agedprofessionals without significant underlying disease. Apart from one patient, all cases werefirst tested when symptoms were still mild or in the prodromal stage, a period in which mostpatients would present once there is general awareness of a circulating pandemic disease5.Diagnostic testing suggests that simple throat swabs will provide sufficient sensitivity at thisstage of infection. This is in stark contrast to SARS. For instance, only 38 of 98 nasal ornasopharyngeal swab samples tested positive by RT-PCR in SARS patients in Hong Kong15.Also, viral load differed considerably. In SARS, it took 7 to 10 days after onset until peakRNA concentrations (of up to 5x105 copies per swab) were reached13,14. In the present study,peak concentrations were reached before day 5, and were more than 1000 times higher.Successful live virus isolation from throat swabs is another striking difference from SARS, forwhich such isolation was rarely successful16-18. Altogether, this suggests active virusreplication in upper respiratory tract tissues, where only minimal ACE-2 expression is foundand SARS-CoV is therefore not thought to replicate19. At the same time, the concurrent useof ACE-2 as a receptor by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to a highly similarexcretion kinetic in sputum, with active replication in the lung. SARS-CoV was found insputum at mean concentrations of 1.2-2.8x106 copies per mL, which corresponds toobservations made here13.Whereas proof of replication by histopathology is awaited, extended tissue tropism ofSARSCoV-2 with replication in the throat is strongly supported by our studies ofsgRNAtranscribing cells in throat swab samples, particularly during the first 5 days of symptoms.Striking additional evidence for independent replication in the throat is provided by sequencefindings in one patient who consistently showed a distinct virus in her throat as opposed tothe lung. Critically, the majority of patients in the present study seemed to be already beyondtheir shedding peak in upper respiratory tract samples when first tested, while shedding ofinfectious virus in sputum continued through the first week of symptoms. Together, thesefindings suggest a more efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV throughactive pharyngeal viral shedding at a time when symptoms are still mild and typical of upperrespiratory tract infection. Later in the disease, COVID-19 then resembles SARS in terms ofreplication in the lower respiratory tract. Of note, the two patients who showed somesymptoms of lung affection showed a prolonged viral load in sputum. Studies should look atthe prognostic value of an increase of viral load beyond the end of week 1, potentiallyindicating aggravation of symptoms.One of the most interesting hypotheses to explain a potential extension of tropism to thethroat is the presence of a polybasic furin-type cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction in theSARS-CoV-2 spike protein that is not present in SARS-CoV17. Insertion of a polybasiccleavage site in the S1-S2 region in SARS-CoV was shown to lead to a moderate butdiscernible gain of fusion activity that might result in increased viral entry in tissues with lowdensity of ACE2 expression20.The combination of very high virus RNA concentrations and occasional detection ofsgRNAcontaining cells in stool indicate active replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Activereplication is also suggested by a much higher detection rate as compared toMERScoronavirus, for which we found stool-associated RNA in only 14.6% samples in 37 patientshospitalized in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia21,22. If virus was only passively present in stool, such asafter swallowing respiratory secretions, similar detection rates as for MERS-CoV would beexpected. Replication in the gastrointestinal tract is also supported by analogy withSARSCoV, which was regularly excreted in stool, from which it could be isolated in cell culture23.Our failure to isolate live SARS-CoV-2 from stool may be due to the mild courses of cases,with only one case showing intermittent diarrhea. In China, diarrhea has been seen in only 2of 99 cases24. Further studies should therefore address whether SARS-CoV-2 shed in stoolis rendered non-infectious though contact with the gut environment. Our initial resultssuggest that measures to contain viral spread should aim at droplet-, rather thanfomitebased transmission.The prolonged viral shedding in sputum is relevant not only for hospital infection control, butalso for discharge management. In a situation characterized by limited capacity of hospitalbeds in infectious diseases wards, there is pressure for early discharge following treatment.Based on the present findings, early discharge with ensuing home isolation could be chosenfor patients who are beyond day 10 of symptoms with less than 100,000 viral RNA copies perml of sputum. Both criteria predict that there is little residual risk of infectivity, based on cellculture.The serological courses of all patients suggest a timing of seroconversion similar to orslightly earlier than in SARS-CoV infection18. Seroconversion in most cases of SARSoccurred during the second week of symptoms. As in SARS and MERS, IgM was notdetected significantly earlier than IgG in immunofluorescence, which might in part be due totechnical reasons as the higher avidity of IgG antibodies outcompetes IgM for viral epitopesin the assay. IgG depletion can only partially alleviate this effect. Because IFA is alaborintensive method, ELISA tests should be developed as a screening test. Neutralizationtesting is necessary to rule out cross-reactive antibodies directed against endemic humancoronaviruses. Based on frequently low neutralizing antibody titers observed in coronavirusinfection 12,25, we have here developed a particularly sensitive plaque reduction neutralizationassay. Considering the titers observed, a simpler microneutralization test format is likely toprovide sufficient sensitivity in routine application and population studies.When aligned to viral load courses, it seems there is no abrupt virus elimination at the time ofseroconversion. Rather, seroconversion early in week 2 coincides with a slow but steadydecline of sputum viral load. Whether certain properties such as glycosylation pattern atcritical sites of the glycoprotein play a role in the attenuation of neutralizing antibodyresponse needs further clarification. In any case, vaccine approaches targeting mainly theinduction of antibody responses should aim to induce particularly strong antibody responsesin order to be effective.19202122232425Bertram, S. et al.

Both laboratories used apre-formulated oligonucleotide mixture (Tib-Molbiol, Berlin, Germany) to make laboratoryprocedures more reproducible. All patients were also tested for other respiratory viruses,including human coronaviruses (HCoV) -HKU1, -OC43, -NL63, -229E; Influenza virus A andB, Rhinovirus, Enterovirus, Respiratory syncytial virus, Human Parainfluenza virus 1-4,Human metapneumovirus, Adenovirus, and Human bocavirus using LightMix-ModularAssays (Roche, Penzberg, Germany).
