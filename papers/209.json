Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing dataand therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largelycaptured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggeststhat (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95%confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th orthe 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February,3132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the currentcontrol measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spreadof this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measurescould be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) possibly originated from bats1 and caused thecurrent pneumonia outbreak, raging since December 2019. As the COVID-19 has anexcessively high human-to-human transmission capability, and the early outbreak stagecoincided with the travel rush of the Chinese Spring Festival, the pandemic has beenspreading rapidly2. According to reports by the National Health Commission of China(NHCC), the first confirmed case was reported in Wuhan (Hubei Province) on 8December 2019; the following day there were also confirmed cases in the major Chinesecities of Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in the neighbouring countries of Japan, Thailandand South Korea; as of 25 January, a total of all 31 Chinese provinces, as well as HongKong, Macau, Taiwan, the United States, France and Australia reported pandemic cases ofCOVID-19. It is apparent that the pandemic is still ongoing both in China andinternationally.In the meantime, Chinese authorities have taken prompt public health measures tocontrol this outbreak. Medical teams and supplies from all over the country flooded intoWuhan. All major cities in Hubei Province were sealed off to contain the spread of thevirus, with quarantine imposed on all people exposed to the virus. China has striven tolimit the spread of the virus through prohibiting human traffic and movement at anunprecedented level. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also taken a series ofmeasures to consolidate global scientific research, quarantine, and surveillance efforts tohelp fight the pandemic. At present, WHO is working with partner agencies to enhancethe global diagnostic capabilities of COVID-19, improve surveillance and the tracking ofdisease transmission, along with mobilizing global powers to coordinate research onvaccines, therapies and diagnostic technologies for the virus.For effective monitoring and containment of the pandemic, it is therefore crucial to6162636465666768697071727374757677787980818283848586878889predict and estimate the spreading dynamics of this novel infectious disease from amodelling point of view. Much has been done using the traditional SIR epidemiologicalmodels3-5. However, such models often suffer from unreliable model structure andparameterization; these problems are especially pronounced in this case when thepathology and the transmission pathways of the virus remain unclear, making rapid,accurate forecasting impossible. Here we propose a population ecology model with atime-varying infection rate that does not rely on the detailed pathology of the diseasebut could accurately capture the spreading dynamics of the virus. This model allows usto estimate and predict the spreading dynamics of the COVID-19 with reliable accuracy,given the current healthcare measures in place.We first develop a simple population dynamic model with a time-varying parameter. Let ( ) be the number of infected cases, with its temporal dynamics following an ordinarydifferential equation,=  ( ) ( ), where  ( ) is the time-dependentinfection rate. This model applies when the susceptible population is large but theoutbreak is limited and temporary so that the demographic dynamics of the entirepopulation remain unchanged (i.e., the additional death and recovery rates caused bythe infection among all residents of the Hubei Province are negligible). With this simplemodel, we can estimate the turning point as the moment when the number of infectedcases increases at the fastest speed, happening when  2 ( )/ 2 = 0. That is, theturning point is the solution to the equation  ( )/+  ( )2 = 0. Notably,  ( )/0 is necessary condition for existing turning point. In practice, the infection rate can beestimated as  ( + 1/2) = ln( ( + 1)) \u2212 ln( ( )), where  is measured in days.We compiled the daily numbers of diagnosed COVID-19 infections from 10 Januaryto 10 February 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and the whole of China from thewebsite of the NHCC (www.nhc.gov.cn) and the Health Commission of Hubei Province(wjw.hubei.gov.cn). This allowed us to analyse the data at four levels: Wuhan city, HubeiProvince, the rest of China, and the whole of China. As there were two large-scale controlmeasures implemented on 26 January and 2 February, we fitted the time-dependent919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119infection rate  ( ) with exponential functions for two periods: from 27 January to 2February, and from 3 February to 10 February. We estimated the trajectories of thecumulative number of infected cases using the fitted infection rate according to thedifference equation,  ( +  ) = exp( ( +  /2) ) ( ), with  = 0.05 (day). The dailyincrease of infected cases can be calculated as ( ( +  ) \u2212  ( ))/ , and the turningpoint can be identified according to the condition  ( )/+  ( )2 = 0.Since 26 January when China implemented strict nationwide control measures, a clearpattern of transmission has emerged. Albeit minor declines can be observed, thetimevarying rate of infection has dropped exponentially for the whole of China and HubeiProvince, although the rate still increases in Wuhan city (red lines in Fig.1). This meansthat the first nationwide control measure (implemented on 26 January) failed to containthe outbreak and the spread remained out of control.According to the data from 3 February to 10 February, the infection rates of Wuhancity, Hubei Province and the whole of China were all declining at largely the same rate (adecrement of 0.16-0.18 per day; the slope of blue lines in Fig.1), similar to the rate ofdecline in the rest of China when the Wuhan and Hubei cases were excluded (the slope ofthe blue curve in Fig.1). It is worth pointing out that the infection rate has declined at asteady pace for areas outside Hubei Province. This suggests that the second nationwidecontrol measure (implemented on 2 February) was effective. The fitted model from 3February to 10 February can accurately predict the daily and accumulated infectionnumbers on 11 February. However, on 12 February, Hubei Province changed its clinicaldiagnostic approach, leading to a sharp rise of diagnosed cases and a reported dailyincrease of 15,151 infections; this unforeseeable change made the number of reportedcases much greater than model predictions. Nevertheless, the reports after 12 Februarysuggest that the change of clinical diagnostic approach did not affect the transmissionpattern, and the daily infection rate reverted to our model prediction (black crosses into our fitted model (from 3 February to 10 February). Our results show that the total121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149numbers of infections in Wuhan city, Hubei province, and the whole of China, are 48,530,64,640 and 77,990 respectively (Table 1). By subtraction, this means a total number of13,350 for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province, which is highly consistent withthe model prediction of 13,660 (see Table 1).Our model also suggests that the spreading dynamics follow a typical S-shapedlogistic curve. This means that there is a turning point when the rate of infection hasreached its peak. Transmission accelerates when approaching the turning point, thendecelerates after the turning point. Our model indicates a turning point around the 4th tothe 5th of February (Fig.1 & 2). The duration of the outbreak, for reaching 95% of thefinal predicted number of infection from 10 January, was estimated to last 46 days inWuhan city, 43 days in Hubei and the whole of China, and 37 days when Hubei wasexcluded (Table 1); it was estimated the outbreak would subside at the end of Februaryin China.Our model assumed an infinite size of a susceptible population trivially affected byinfection, recovery and control. This makes our model different from the traditional SIRor SEIR epidemiological models, where the rise of infection cases is due to the largesusceptible population, while the decline of infection cases is due to the depletion of thesusceptible population. Such typical pattern of epidemiological models is obviouslyunsuitable for the spread of COVID-19 in China with susceptible populations of suchmassive size (e.g., >11 million residents in Wuhan alone and ~60 million residents inHubei). Epidemiological models could be more suitable for modelling the spread ofCOVID-19 among the 3,400 passengers and crew members on the Diamond Princesscruise ship currently docked in Japan\u2019s Yokohama harbour for quarantine.        Our simple model captured the dynamic nature of the infection rate, which can beadjusted flexibly according to updated data. This allows us to predict short-termspreading dynamics with accuracy, which is essential for the live monitoring of theepidemic. According to the time dependency of the infection rate, we could also assessthe effectiveness of implemented control measures and provide modelling support toadjust any public health measures.
