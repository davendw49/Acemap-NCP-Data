In infected cells, the CoVRNAsynthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that aretransformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). While double-membrane vesicles(DMVs) appear to be a pan-coronavirus RO element, studies to date describe an assortmentof additional coronavirus-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remainsunclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the samemembrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs)previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sitesof replication. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitativeEM autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cellsinfected with the beta-CoVs MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and the gamma-CoV infectiousbronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular orvirusinduced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establishDMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in coronavirusinfection.39404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263        The RNA synthesis of all positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses of eukaryotes occurs in thecytoplasm of the host cell, in conjunction with modified endomembranes that are oftenreferred to as viral replication organelles (ROs) [                The first electron tomography analysis of a coronavirus-induced RO, that of the severe acuterespiratory syndrome-CoV [                DMVs would pose the conundrum of how metabolites and newly made genomic andsubgenomic mRNAs could be transported across the double-lipid bilayer. Nevertheless,experimental evidence for the location of vRNA synthesis within the RO was lacking.Importantly, dsRNA is not a bona fide marker for vRNA synthesis as it may no longer beassociated with the active enzymatic replication complexes in which most of the 16 viralnonstructural proteins (nsps) come together. Thus, the possibility of vRNA synthesis taking placein alternative locations, like the convoluted membranes (CM) that are also prominentelements of the beta-CoV RO [                The interpretation of the CoV RO structure and function was further compounded by thediscovery of different RO elements, never reported in beta-CoV infections, that set apartother distantly-related CoVs genera. In particular, zippered ER (instead of CM) anddoublemembrane spherules (DMSs) were detected for the avian gamma-CoV infectious bronchitisvirus (IBV) [29] and, recently, for the porcine deltacoronavirus [                In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and function of the RO inducedby members of different CoV genera, with a special focus on beta-CoVs like SARS-CoV andMERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) [                Our observations on the 3D morphology of the MERS-CoV RO were compared with datafrom cells infected with other alpha-, beta-, and gamma-CoVs. This comparative analysismade it clear that all these CoV induce essentially the same membrane structures, includingDMSs. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized vRNA was used to determine the site(s) ofvRNA synthesis within the CoV RO. To this end, we used a radiolabeled nucleoside([3H]uridine) and applied the classic and highly-sensitive technique of EM autoradiography[        MERS-CoV induces a membrane network of modified membranes that containsdouble-membrane spherules (DMSs)We first set out to analyse the ultrastructure of MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells under samplepreparation conditions favourable for autoradiography (see Materials and Methods) (Fig 1, S1Video). Strikingly, in addition to the DMVs and CM that are well established hallmarks ofbeta-CoV infections, the presence of small spherules, occasionally in large numbers, wasreadily apparent (Fig 1A and 1B). These spherules were notably similar to the DMSspreviously described for the gamma-CoV IBV [29]. Their remarkably regular size of ~80 nm(average diameter 79.8 \u00b1 2.5 nm, n=58), a delimiting double membrane and theirelectrondense content, made these spherules clearly distinct from other structures, including progenyvirions, which had comparable diameter (Fig 1C and 1D). The double-membrane spherules(DMSs) generated during IBV infection were previously described as invaginations of thezippered ER that remain open to the cytosol [29]. In MERS-CoV-infected cells, the DMSswere connected to the CM from which they seemed to derive (Fig 1E). Clear openings to thecytosol could not be detected for the large majority (~80%, n=54) of the fully reconstructedDMSs, which suggests that the original invagination may eventually transform into a sealedcompartment. This type of apparently closed DMSs were also present, though in a lowerproportion (~50%, n=39), in IBV-infected cell samples processed in an identical manner (S1Fig).Fig 1.

(D) Whisker plots of the size distribution of DMSs (n=58), virions (n=28) andDMVs (n=109), as measured from the tomograms. DMSs and virions have a comparable size (mediandiameter, 80 nm), while the median diameter of the DMVs is 247 nm. (E) Models and tomographicslices through an open (left) and closed (right) DMS. Both types of DMSs are connected with the CM.In open DMSs, both the inner and outer membranes (dark blue and orange, respectively) arecontinuous with CM. Two ~8-nm apart slices through the reconstruction are shown. For closed DMSsonly the outer membrane is connected to CM, while the inner membrane seems to define a closedcompartment. (F) Gallery of tomographic slices highlighting membrane connections between differentelements of the MERS-CoV RO, and of these with the ER. These include CM-ER (black arrowheads),DMV-ER (white arrowheads), CM-DMV (dark grey arrowheads), and CM-DMS (light greyarrowhead) connections. Scale bars, 250 nm (A, B), and 100 nm (C -F).Our data suggests a functional analogy between zippered ER and CM, as both structuresappear to provide membranes for DMS formation. In fact, both bore a striking resemblanceunder the same sample preparation conditions: MERS-CoV-induced CM noticeably consistedof zippered smooth membranes that were connected to the rough ER and branched andcurved in intricate arrangements. Although unbranched zippered ER was most common inIBV-infected cells, as described [29], we also detected zippered ER morphologically closer toCM (S1B Fig). These observations argue for zippered ER and CM representing alternativeconfigurations of essentially the same virus-induced RO element.        The 3D architecture of MERS-CoV-induced RO aligned with previous observations for otherCoV [                  To investigate the subcellular localization of vRNA synthesis in cells infected with differentCoVs, we metabolically labelled newly-synthesized vRNA by arresting cellular transcriptionwith actinomycin D and using a radiolabelled nucleoside precursor ([5-3H]uridine) forsubsequent detection by EM autoradiography [          Fig. 3.

Labellingdensities and relative labelling indexes (RLI) in different subcellular regions of (C) Vero E6 cellsinfected with SARS-CoV (MOI 10) or (D) Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV (MOI 5).Radioactively-labelled uridine was provided for the indicated periods of time immediately beforefixation at 7 hpi and 12 hpi, respectively. Control mock-infected cells are excluded from the RLIplots, as RLI comparisons between conditions require the same number of classes (subcellularregions) and these cells lack ROs and virions.Abundant autoradiography signal was detected by EM in SARS-CoV-infected cellspulselabelled for 20 min (Fig 3B), accumulating in the regions that contained virus-inducedmembrane modifications, which aligned with the idea that these structures are the primaryplatforms for vRNA synthesis. This largely accepted notion, however, does not formallyexclude the possibility vRNA synthesis could also be associated with other cellularmembranes, albeit to a lower extent. Such an association with morphologically intactmembranes could be important, for example, in the first stages of infection, when the levelsof the viral membrane-remodelling proteins are still low.          Importantly, establishing the association of autoradiography signal with specific subcellularstructures requires a detailed quantitative analysis, as the autoradiography signal can spread233234235236237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251252253254255up to a few hundred nanometers from the original radioactive source (see S1 Appendix). Thistype of analysis was used to compare CoV- and mock-infected cells labelled for differentperiods of time. To this end, we analysed the autoradiography signal present in hundreds ofregions that were randomly picked from large EM mosaic images [38] and calculatedlabelling densities and relative labelling indexes (RLI) per compartment [          Our next goal was to determine which elements of the coronaviral RO (DMVs, CM/zipperedER and/or DMSs) are directly involved in vRNA synthesis. A first answer to this questionbecame readily apparent as regions containing DMVs, but not either of the other ROstructural elements, were densely labelled in cells infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV orIBV (Fig 4A and 4B, Fig 3B, and S3 Fig, respectively). Interestingly, not all the DMVclusters in a sample, and sometimes even within a cell, appeared equally densely labelled,which suggests that the levels of vRNA synthesis in DMVs are variable and could change intime. The active role of DMVs in vRNA synthesis in MERS-CoV-infected cells was furthercorroborated by a detailed analysis of the distribution of autoradiography signal aroundisolated DMVs (Fig 4C). In case of a random distribution (i.e. if the DMVs were not a trueradioactive source), the number of autoradiography grains around the DMVs would simplyincrease with the distance, as the perimeter of the screened area also increases and with it thechances of detecting background signal. The signal around DMVs was clearly not random,showing maximum levels in the proximity of these structures (Fig 4C). Moreover, thedistribution normalized by the distance made apparent a maximum around the average radiusof the DMVs analysed (133 \u00b1 28 nm, n=36) (Fig 4E), aligning with the idea that vRNAsynthesis takes place in membrane-bound enzymatic complexes.Fig 4. DMVs are sites of vRNA synthesis. Analysis of the association of autoradiography signal withDMVs in MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells (MOI 5). The cells were pre-treated with actinomycin D at10 hpi, and labelled with tritiated uridine for 30 min immediately before fixation (12 hpi). (A)Overview of an infected cell in which regions with different virus-induced modifications areannotated in yellow (DMVs), blue (CM) and orange (DMSs). Several densely-labelled regionscontaining DMVs, but not the other virus-induced structures are apparent. A close-up of one of theseregions (boxed area) is shown in (B).

The data is plotted (C) as ahistogram, or (D) normalized by the radius to the DMV centre to account for the increase in thescreened area. Scale bars, (A) 5 \u00b5m, (B) 500 nm.Next, we specifically investigated the possible involvement in vRNA synthesis of CM and/orDMSs, which always were present in membrane-modification clusters that also containedDMVs. A close inspection of CM showed that these structures were mainly devoid of signaland that the occasional silver grains present primarily appeared in the periphery of CM,therefore likely stemming from surrounding labelled DMVs (Fig 5A and B). Similarobservations were made for DMSs (Fig 5C-E): most of them (85%) lacked signal and the restwas close to abundantly labelled DMVs. Furthermore, no signs of DMSs acting as a signalsource were apparent in the distribution of signal around them, which resembled that of arandom pattern (Fig 5E, compare with Fig 4D).Fig. 5. Newly-synthesized vRNA signal does not clearly associate with CM or DMSs. (A)Overview of a cluster of MERS-CoV-induced membrane modifications in Huh7 cells prepared asdescribed in Fig. 4. Some DMSs are boxed in orange while regions with CM are encircled in blue. Incomparison with the densely-labelled surrounding DMVs, these regions are relatively devoid ofautoradiography signal. (B) The distribution of autoradiography grains on CM was not homogeneous(nCM=9), and label was predominantly found close to the boundaries of the CM, as expected if thesignal arises from the surrounding DMVs. (C-E) Analysis of the label around/on the DMSs (seeMaterials and Methods for selection criteria and details). (C) Enlargements of the DMS areas boxed in(A). Most DMSs were devoid of signal and those who contained label were close to labelled DMVs(D) (nDMS = 105). (E) The distribution of signal around DMSs shows an increase in the amount ofautoradiography grains with the distance from the DMS centre, as expected from a randomdistribution (nDMSs = 54). Scale bars, (A) 500 nm, (C) 100 nm.          To explore whether these observations could be extended to distantly-related CoVs, weexpanded this type of analysis to the gamma-CoV IBV. IBV-induced DMSs are particularlyabundant and a large proportion of them have an open configuration, which contributed to thehypothesis that these open DMSs could be engaged in vRNA synthesis [          If CM and DMSs are not involved in vRNA synthesis, what is the role (if any) of these ROstructural elements in coronavirus replication? To investigate this, we analysed thesubcellular locationof different viralmarkers inMERS-CoV-infectedcellsbyimmunoelectron microscopy (IEM) (Fig 6).          Fig. 6. IEM detection of viral markers in MERS-CoV-infected cells. (A-G) Immunogold labelingof thawed cryo-sections of MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells (12 hpi) for the detection of the indicatedviral proteins. (A-C) Structural proteins were detected on virions (black arrowheads) and, for the Mand S proteins, also on Golgi cisterna. While regions containing DMS (white arrowheads) and CMlabelled for the N protein (D) and nsp3 (G), the M and S protein were not detected in these areas.(HI) Immunogold labeling of dsRNA in HPF-FS samples of MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells (13 hpi).The label accumulated on DMVs, which could be easily detected in this type of samples (grey333334335336337338339340341342343344345346347348349350351352353354355356arrowheads), while the regions with CM and DMSs, which appeared as dark areas among the DMVclusters, where devoid of dsRNA signal. G, Golgi complex; m, mitochondria. Scale bars, 250 nm.Coronavirus-induced DMSs, with their electron-dense content and their remarkably regularsize, are particularly intriguing structures. Revealing DMSs in IEM samples, however, waschallenging and, in our hands, required a modified protocol for the preparation of thawedcryo-sections [                    Previously, the CM induced by SARS-CoV and MHV were shown by IEM to accumulateviral nsps, while dsRNA signal was primarily found inside the DMVs [          In summary, for the antibodies tested (recognizing N, M, S, nsp3, and dsRNA), the labellingpattern in MERS-CoV-induced DMSs closely resembled that of the CM, from which theyseem to derive. The absence of labelling for key proteins in virus assembly, like the M and Sproteins, strongly suggest that DMSs do not represent (spurious) virus assembly events.        The comprehensive analysis presented here demonstrates that viruses across different CoVgenera induce essentially the same type of membrane structures. After somewhat disparateobservations [                Our results clearly establish DMVs as the primary \u2013if not only- site of vRNA synthesiswithin the coronaviral RO. This point has been subject to quite some speculation, due in partto the limited experimental data directly addressing this question. An early study usingBrUTP and IEM to detect newly-synthesized vRNA mapped signal in DMV regions ofMHVinfected cells [                While the finding of open DMSs, similar to the invaginations that many +RNA viruses use asreplication sites, made them attractive candidate sites for vRNA synthesis [                Our results add to studies that, in the last years and after much speculation, have started toprovide experimental evidence that the DMVs induced by +RNA viruses are active sites ofvRNA synthesis [        While a definitive answer to this issue is still missing, our results allow narrowing down thepossible scenarios. If the DMVs are closed structures lacking an import/export mechanism,vRNA synthesis on the outer DMV membrane appears as a necessity to provide vRNA fortranslation and encapsidation. Then, vRNA synthesis inside the DMVs would also berequired to explain the observed accumulation of (presumably viral) dsRNA. Although this isnot at all an attractive possibility, as vRNA synthesis inside the DMVs and even DMV444445446447448449450451452453454455456457458459460461462463464formation would appear spurious, it cannot be completely discarded at this stage. The mostappealing scenario is that in which vRNA synthesis only takes place inside the DMVs. Thiswould provide the compartmentalization of vRNA synthesis that may be most beneficial forviral replication, although it would require the existence of a yet unidentified import/exportmechanism. Notice that a transport mechanism would also be needed in the third possiblescenario, i.e. if vRNA synthesis occurs only on the outer DMV membrane, to account for theaccumulation of dsRNA inside the DMVs that could then perhaps serve to hide excess vRNAfrom detection by innate immune sensors [62].Despite the lack of clear openings in the membranes of CoV-induced DMVs, a mechanismallowing exchange of material with the cytosol is conceivable. The openings of DMV may beextremely short-lived, and therefore they may have eluded detection by EM. This maybecome apparent in the future, if mutant CoV inducing DMVs with slower dynamics arefound. An appealing alternative is the existence of molecular pores that may well beundetectable in conventional EM samples. Precedents of molecular complexes bridgingdouble membranes include the large nuclear pore complex, but also small transportersthrough the mitochondrial or chloroplast membranes. Visualizing such a putative smallmolecular pore on DMVs is a formidable challenge that would likely require the use ofcryoEM to preserve macromolecular components. Emerging techniques like in situcryotomography, which allows the visualization of structures in their cellular context atmacromolecular resolution, may be key to realize this next step and to understand how CoVsexploit the complex architecture of DMVs.632633634635636637638639640641642643644645646647648649650651652653654655656657658659660661or totally surrounded by DMVs. Only large CM (> 0.6 \u00b5m across) were selected in order tomake more apparent (if present) any decay of the autoradiography signal as the distance tothe surrounding DMVs increased. For each autoradiography grain, both the distance to theclosest CM boundary (d1) and the distance to the opposite CM edge (d2) were measured. Therelative distance to the CM edge was then calculated as d1/(d1+d2) and expressed inpercentages. All the measurements in different DMVs, DMSs and CM were made usingAperio Imagescope software (Leica) and pooled together into three single data sets.This work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(NWOMEERVOUD-836.10.003 to M.B.).

The location of theradioactive marker can then be made apparent by applying a highly-sensitive photographicemulsion (a nuclear emulsion) on top of the cell sections and exposing it for several weeks tomonths. The beta particles that are emitted as a result of tritium disintegrations generateelectrons that get trapped in the silver halide emulsion and create a \u201clatent image\u201d. When theemulsion is developed, these negative charges promote the reduction to metallic silver,generating electron-dense grains that are visible by EM. In principle, given enough time toaccumulate enough radioactive disintegrations, even low levels of the radioactivemarkercould be detected. In practice, other factors (e.g. background radiation, emulsion aging) setsome limits to autoradiography, which is nonetheless a very sensitive technique.The resolution of EM autoradiography is limited by the fact that radioactive disintegrationsgenerate beta particles that are emitted in random directions. Importantly, the probability ofgiving rise to signal degreases with the distance from the radioactive source; however, somebeta particles may travel up to a few hundred nanometers before striking the photographicemulsion [          S1 Fig. Membrane structures induced by gamma-CoV infections. Tomography ofVeroE6 cells infected with IBV, fixed at 18 hpi and processed for EM following the same protocolas for MER-CoV-infected cells (Fig 1). Tomographic slices through two regions containingIBV-induced membrane modifications. These include DMVs (asterisks), DMSs (whitearrowheads) and zippered ER (white arrows). Most zippered ER consists of long stretches ofER-derived paired membranes (A), though branching zippered ER, closer to the CMdescribed for beta-CoV, was also present (B) Virus particles (black arrowheads) budding intothe ER membranes were often observed.

Analysisof previously described samples of CoV-infected cells, prepared for EM either by HPF(A) orcryo-plunging (B). A targeted search revealed the presence of DMSs (white arrowheads) inclose association with CM. In comparison with the chemically fixed samples used in thisstudy, the superior ultrastructural preservation of cryo-fixation results in less distortedmembranes, but also in a denser cytoplasm and darker CM that makes DMS less apparent.(A) Example from a MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cell (16 hpi) in a sample used in [6].

Vero cells infected with IBV were pre-treated withactinomycin D for 1 hour, then labelled for 30 or 60 min with tritiated uridine, immediatelyfixed at 16 and 17 hpi, respectively, and processed for autoradiography EM. (A) Overview ofan IBV-infected Vero cell (60 min labelling). The areas containing DMVs and zippered ERare outlined in yellow and blue, respectively, and other subcellular structures annotated (N,nucleus; m, mitochondria; Au, autophagosome; VCR, virion-containing regions). Theautoradiography signal accumulates in areas of virus-induced membrane modifications thatoften only contain DMVs, in alignment with DMVs having an active role in vRNA synthesis.(B) Close-up of the area boxed in black in (A), which contains DMVs, zippered ER andDMSs (orange arrowheads). The contrast between the densely labelled DMVs and thezippered ER and DMSs largely lacking signal is apparent and suggests that theautoradiography grains sometimes present on the latter structures arose from radioactivedisintegrations in the surrounding active DMVs. (C) In agreement with this possibility, mostof the DMSs (96%) were devoid of signal, and most of those that contained label where closeto an active DMV (nDMS = 178). (D) Furthermore, the distribution of autoradiography grainsaround DMSs resembled that of a random distribution, where the number of grains increasewith the distance (nDMS =106). (E) In contrast, a similar analysis of the signal around theDMVs proved that these structures are associated with vRNA synthesis, as the signal reachesmaximum values in the proximity of the DMVs (nDMVs = 51).

RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular orvirusinduced structure. Importantly, dsRNA is not a bona fide marker for vRNA synthesis as it may no longer beassociated with the active enzymatic replication complexes in which most of the 16 viralnonstructural proteins (nsps) come together.

Thistype of analysis was used to compare CoV- and mock-infected cells labelled for differentperiods of time. A first answer to this questionbecame readily apparent as regions containing DMVs, but not either of the other ROstructural elements, were densely labelled in cells infected with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV orIBV (Fig 4A and 4B, Fig 3B, and S3 Fig, respectively). In case of a random distribution (i.e. if the DMVs were not a trueradioactive source), the number of autoradiography grains around the DMVs would simplyincrease with the distance, as the perimeter of the screened area also increases and with it thechances of detecting background signal.

C, D) Distribution of the autoradiography signal around DMVs282283284285286287288289290291292293294295296297298299300301302303304305306307(nDMVs = 36, see Material and Methods for selection criteria and details). Newly-synthesized vRNA signal does not clearly associate with CM or DMSs. ( This work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(NWOMEERVOUD-836.10.003 to M.B.).

These include DMVs (asterisks), DMSs (whitearrowheads) and zippered ER (white arrows). In comparison with the chemically fixed samples used in thisstudy, the superior ultrastructural preservation of cryo-fixation results in less distortedmembranes, but also in a denser cytoplasm and darker CM that makes DMS less apparent.(A) Example from a MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cell (16 hpi) in a sample used in [6].
