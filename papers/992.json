With rigorous evidence-based approaches,the multidisciplinary team completed the urgentrecommendations within one week.We recommended the hospital emergency incidentcommand system (HICS), which should be the primarysystematic response of the hospital.2 Though requiredby the World Health Organization (WHO) as essential forhospitals to reflect rapidly and efficiently, HICS is in factnot widely adopted in primary and secondary hospitalsin China. For guideline users who need detailedinformation about HICS, we here link the hospital emergencyresponse checklist7 and the hospital incident commandsystem guidebook8 in our document. We alsorecommended diagnostic tools, an early warning scorerecognising patients who may need intensive care,occupational protection protocols, in-hospital sterilizationprotocols and isolation protocols for hospital managers andpractitioners to rearrange their hospital to deal with thecrisis.2This new evidence-based guideline of hospitalinfection control for COVID-19 has provided timely guidanceon what to do during the emergency. However, since littlewas known about the novel virus, only indirect evidencewas available, which in turn increased the risk of biasfor evidence selection in the LTR strategy. As a result,half of our recommendations are weak and systematicreviews will be involved in some of following guidancedocuments. The recommendations will be updated whennecessary.Upon its publication, the urgent recommendationswere spread widely, and have received substantialattention by media and hospital managers andpractitioners. The main recommendations have beensubmitted to the authorities to assist in policy decisionmaking. This new form of evidence-basedguideline sets an example of urgent translating evidenceinto policy decision making during the public healthcrises.None declared.We thank Dr. Heyue Du from the Department ofNephrology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Ms.Yiling Zhou from the Department of Endocrinology andMetabolism, West China Hospital, Sichuan University fortranslating the Chinese version of the recommendationinto English.Supplementary material is available in PrecisionClinical Medicine online at https://doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa008.", "ref_list": [[], ["Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: Implications for virus origins and receptor binding"], ["Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: A descriptive study"], ["Building an evaluation instrument for China's hospital emergency preparedness: A systematic review of preparedness instruments"], ["Disease control of 2019-novel coronavirus infection in hospital: West China urgent recommendation"], ["Trustworthy guidelines, evidence summaries and decision aids that we can all use and share"], ["Promoting the rapid creation and effective use of high-quality clinical practice guidelines: MAGIC system and China initiative"], ["Hospital emergency response checklist: An all-hazards tool for hospital administrators and emergency managers"], ["Hospital incident command system guidebook"], ["Xin Sun2 and Weimin Li4,* 1Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], ["R Lu", "X Zhao", "J Li"], ["N Chen", "M Zhou", "X Dong"], ["R Tang", "G Fitzgerald", "XY Hou"], ["S Li", "W Huang", "X Liao"], [], ["X Sun", "L Li", "S Li"], ["BS Sorensen", "RD Zane", "BE Wante"], ["California"], ["Zong3 Zhiyong", "4Department China"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "\n        The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID19, previously named 2019-nCoV) has become a serious\npublic health situation in China.1,2 As of February\n1\n        ", "one_words_summarize": "It should be one of the major contributions of theMAGIC China Center since its establishment in April 2019with the joint efforts of the MAGIC Evidence EcosystemFoundation and WCH.6In developing the urgent recommendations ofhospital infection control of COVID-19, we recruited guidelinecommittee members including clinicians, hospitalmanagers, methodologists and other practitioners.
