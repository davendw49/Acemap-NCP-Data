Then we gave random numbers forvariables. We used RF to predict the Yi for every city, and used the newly calculatedquantifying the trend of Y using the five explanatory variables; and then defined Yi asa categorical variable, classifying the response level of each city. At last, we manuallyassigned all cities (except for Shennongjia Forestry District, where has only 10 casesof 2019-nCoV) in Hubei Province with the highest category, the level I. The data andFig 2.

The importance of variables for classifying the risk levels of the 442 cities in Chinafive variables. The cumulative number of confirmed cases represents the size of the2019-nCoV outbreak. The increased number of cases indicates the dynamics of virustransmission. Population size of a city is the key variable for epidemics, which isdirectly associated with the potential outbreak size. Population density is also animportant factor, since dense population would accelerate virus transmission.          highly correlated.
