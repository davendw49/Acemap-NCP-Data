Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown invitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment.", "text": "Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmedSARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO(treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free fromhypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenationbetween the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity ofSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests.Ethics and dissemination. The study protocol has been approved by the Investigational ReviewBoard of Xijing Hospital (Xi\u2019an, China) and pending the Partners Human Research Committee(Boston, USA). Recruitment will start after approval of both IRBs and local IRBs at otherenrolling centers. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented atscientific meetings, reported through flyers and posters, and published on related website ormedia in combating against this widespread contagious diseases.Trial registration.

NCT submitted\u23af Supplementation with nitric oxide (NO) might improve oxygenation and survival of\u23af The antiviral activity of NO inhalation will be explored by measuring the time differencebetween the two groups to reach SARS-CoV-2 RT- PCR negativity.\u23af The spread of the disease worldwide determines the geographic areas of study and therecruitment rate of patients.The first pneumonia case with unknown etiology were identified in Wuhan, China in earlyDecember 2019 [1]. The genomic sequence of this new pathogen and a diagnostic real-timereverse transcriptase polymerase (rt-PCR) chain assay were published in January 2020.Highthroughput sequencing of the bronchialveolar samples from these patients has revealed a novelbetacoronavirus that is currently named SARS-CoV-2, as it resembled severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus [2].SARS-CoV-2 has so far infected more than 110,000 people worldwide with more than 4,000deaths (3.6% of diagnosed patients). The World Health Organization has declared theSARSCoV-2 infection as a public health emergency of international concern. [3]. The majority of thecases has been reported in China, but significant outbreaks are taking place in South Korea,Japan, Europe, Iran and more recently in USA [4]. In the human host, SARS-CoV-2 infectionmay be asymptomatic or may cause a syndrome (named COVID-19) ranging from common coldto a severe pneumonia with acute respiratory syndrome and need of mechanical ventilation inintensive care unit (ICU). In a retrospective Chinese study on 138 consecutive patients admittedwith COVID-19, the median time from clinical onset to hospital admission was 7 days, 26% ofpatients were admitted to the ICU and 61% of them met clinical criteria for acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS) [5]. Another retrospective Chinese study on critically ill patients withCOVID-19 pneumonia showed that 67% of patients met ARDS criteria, with a mortality of61.5% at 28 days. Reported casualties in the ICU are characterized of various profiles ofmultiorgan failure (81% of deceased patients had ARDS, 37.5% had AKI, 28% had cardiacinjury and 28% had liver failure) [6]. Autoptic findings in a published clinical case showedfeatures resembling those of coronavirus-related infections such as Severe Acute RespiratoryDistress Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Resporatory Syndrome (MERS), includingbilateral diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes andhyaline membrane formation. Findings in cardiac and hepatic tissues may suggest thecontribution of a viral infection as well[7].COVID-19 is highly contagious and responsible for thousands of casualties and is now spreadingto many countries. The combined effect of the high transmission and the reported high incidenceof severe disease in symptomatic patients poses a threat to healthcare systems involved in theoutbreaks in different ways, including: cumulative casualties, increased need for hospital andICU beds causing work overload for all the healthcare staff and often forcing hospitals to shutdown all elective surgical activity; high social and economic costs, dramatically reduction of theproductivity by the rigorous quarantine requirements and strategies for curtailing diseasespreading, which made economic pain that disrupt supply chains and stock markets .To-date, no treatment showed to increase survival and decrease the need for ventilatory supportin patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19. In responding to thisepidemic, the treatment strategies should be safe, can be quickly pass through the regulatoryreviews and can be used on a massive scale with low cost. Therefore, screen for the existingtreatments seemed to be the potential choice.In clinical settings, NO gas has been approved by the US Federal Drug Administration for thetreatment of pulmonary hypertension of the newborn in presence of hypoxic respiratory failure.However, NO gas has been advocated as rescue treatment in adults with hypoxic ARDS [8].In 2004, during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak,Chen et al. reported the use of inhaled NO gas (iNO) in six patients with severe symptoms.Treatment with iNO reversed pulmonary hypertension, improved remarkably severe hypoxemiaand shortened the length of ventilatory support as compared to matched control patients withSARS-CoV [9]. In a subsequent in-vitro study, nitric oxide (NO) donors (e.g.S-nitroso-Nacetylpenicillamine) greatly increased the survival rate of SARS-CoV-infected eukaryotic cells,suggesting direct antiviral effects of NO [9]. Coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV sharesmost of the genome of COVID-19 virus indicating potential effectiveness of iNO therapy inthese patients.Due to similarities with the Coronavirus responsible for SARS and COVID-19, wehypothesize that in addition to improve the oxygenation of the severe cases, iNO gas retainspotent antiviral activity against 2019-nCoV responsible for SARS-CoV-2. We designed thisstudy to assess whether continuous delivery of iNO as rescue therapy may increase oxygenationand improves survival in patients with SARS-CoV-2.Study Setting. This is a multicenter, randomized (1:1) controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial.Given the absence of a targeted therapy, the refractory hypoxemia and the high mortalityassociated with SARS-CoV-2, we propose this protocol to all interested centers withSARSCoV-2 patients.Eligibility criteria. Inclusion criteria are: (1) Adult patients, > 18 year-old; (2) admitted to theICU; (3) intubated and mechanically ventilated; (4) confirmed diagnosis by positve rt-PCR2019nCoV; (5) severe hypoxemia, defined by PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg.Exclusion criteria are: (1) patients intubated for more than 72 hours from initiation of thetreatment gas; (2) physician being contrary to the involvement as participating in the trial is notin the patient's best interest, or any condition that does not allow the protocol to be followedsafely; (3) pregnancy.Patients enrolled in other clinical interventional trials investigating potential targeted therapiesagainst 2019-nCoV do not exclude participation to this trial.Interventions. Eligible patients are randomized to receive either institutional standard of carewith iNO addition (treatment arm) or plain institutional standard of care (control arm). Standardsof care are delivered according to the institution own protocols (such as ventilation strategies anduse and dosage of antivirals and antimicrobials, steroids, inotropic-vasopressor agents andinitiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator [ECMO]).Patients in the treatment arm receive iNO at 80 ppm for the first 48 hours after enrollment, thenreduce to 40 ppm until severe hypoxemia resolves. Weaning from NO will start when patientsimprove the level of oxygenation to PaO2/FiO2> 300 mmHg for more than 24 hoursconsecutively. Since abrupt discontinuation of iNO can sometimes result in rebound pulmonaryhypertension, with possible oxygenation impairment and acute right heart failure, gradualdiscontinuation will be performed. Physicians will follow their own institution weaningprotocols. In absence of institutional protocols, iNO will be reduced every 4 hours in stepwisefashion starting from 40 ppm to 20, 10, 5, 3, 2 and 1 ppm. If case of hypoxemia (SpO2< 93%) oracute hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) during weaning, iNO should beincreased to the prior higher concentration.Safety. NO reacts with oxygen to form NO2, which may cause airway inflammation and damageto lung tissues. Moreover, NO oxidizes ferrous Hb to form Met-Hb, which is unable to transportand release oxygen to tissues. [11]. The binding of NO to Hb is a rapidly reversible reaction,with a half-life of 15\u201320 min after NO discontinuation. The side effects and adverse eventsrelated to iNO delivery are well reported in the literature. Based on the present literature andFood and Drug Administration reports, the risks of breathing iNO at 80 ppm for 24 hours areminimal when Met-Hb levels and NO/NO2 delivery levels are carefully monitored [12]. Toimprove safety, in the present trial, iNO is administered and monitored by trained clinicians. TheNO2 will be monitored and maintained at levels of below 2 ppm. Met-Hb is continuouslymonitored by non-invasive co-oximetry. If Met-Hb levels exceed 5% of circulating Hb, theconcentration of NO delivered is halved and closely monitored until a reduction occurs. IfMetHb levels persist above 5%, iNO is progressively halved until a reduction below 5% occurs.Blinding. The study will be blinded to the patient. Outcome assessors, data analysts, the studypersonnel delivering the NO gas and monitoring patient\u2019s methemoglobin levels will not beblinded.Outcomes. The primary outcome is the improvement of arterial oxygenation at 48 hours fromenrollment between the two groups. If a patient dies before the initiation of the gas, the patientwill not enter the trial. If a patient dies during the first 48 hours of treatment, the last availableblood gas analysis will be used. Levels of oxygenation will be calculated by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio.Patients will be followed until 90 days from enrollment.Secondary outcomes include: (1) time to reach normoxia defined by a PaO2/FiO2> 300 for atleast 24 hours during the first 28 days after enrollment. If a patient dies before day 28, the patientwill be considered as \u201cnever recovered\u201d; (2) proportion of SARS-nCoV-2 free patients (i.e.,normoxiemic patients) during the first 28 days after enrollment. If a patient dies before day 28,the patient will be considered as \u201cnever recovered\u201d; (3) Survival at 28 days and 90 days fromenrollment.The following data will be collected to assess exploratory outcomes, such as: (1) Dailyoxygenation in the two groups until day 28; (2) Need for new renal replacement therapy duringthe first 28 days; (3) Mechanical support of circulation (i.e., ECMO, intra-aortic balloon pump,VADs) during the first 28 days; (4) Days free of vasopressors during the first 28 days; (5)Ventilator-free day at 28 days; (6) Time to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative in upper respiratorytract specimen (assessed within the first 28 days); (7) ICU-free days at 28 days.Sample size. We hypothesize that NO gas therapy leads to an improvement of oxygenation dueto amelioration of ventilation perfusion matching in patients affected with SARS-CoV2. Adifference of 20% in PaO2/FiO2 ratio between the two groups at 48 hours from enrollment isconsidered to be clinically relevant. Available data on oxygenation in SARS-CoV andSARSCoV2 patients in ICU are limited [5] [6] [13]. A previous study in ARDS patients ventilatedaccording to standard of treatment (ARDSnet table) reported a PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 72 hours of190 + 71 mmHg [14]. We hypothesize that iNO gas may increase the PaO2/FiO2 ratio by at least20% in the treatment group. Assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a beta (power) of 0.9, we calculatedwith a two-sample means test (Satterthwaite's t test assuming unequal variances) a need forN1=91 and N2=91 patients. A 10% of dropouts after ICU discharge is foreseen and sample sizeis thereby increased to N=200 patients. Estimated sample sizes where calculated using Stata 14.1software.clinician.Recruitment. All patients admitted into recruiting ICUs with SARS-CoV2 and intubated forhypoxemia are screened for eligibility. If a patient is excluded, the reasons are noted on ascreening log. To obtain informed consent, the details of the study are presented to the patient\u2019shealthcare proxy. A copy of the consent form will be given to the patient\u2019s healthcare proxy.Prior to the initiation of any study procedures, the proxy\u2019s written consent is obtained by aAssignment of interventions. The randomization sequence is created by an independentstatistician using Stata 14.1. A predetermined block randomization method (fixed block size of10) is used to ensure equal distribution of participants to treatment arms and will be uploaded onData collection methods. Clinical information including medical history and laboratory examswill be obtained from the medical charts. Collection of study variables will be managed by theoutcome assessors by using a dedicated patient\u2019s file on Studytrax.Data management. Outcome assessors, treatment providers and the principal investigator willobtain unique usernames and password to transfer all data to a Studytrax page dedicated to thestudy.Statistical methods. Data analysis will be based on the Intention-to-treat principle. For patientsdying during the first 48 hours of treatment, the last available blood gas analysis will be used toassess the primary outcome. For the proposed trial, we anticipate that no participants will missthe primary evaluation.Demographic and clinical characteristics will be presented as number (percentage), mean (SD),or median (interquartile range [IQR]). Comparisons between groups will be made using the \u03c72test or Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and T-test or Wilcoxon\u2019s rank-sum test forcontinuous variables as appropriate. Effect sizes will be described with the probability of morefavorable outcome (probabilistic index) and 95% CI will be calculated.The primary endpoint will be compared using T-test or Mann-Whitney U as appropriate.Time to reach normoxia will be compared within the two groups with a T-Test or Mann-WhitneyU test, as appropriate. To exclude or confirm that the expected benefit in oxygenation by NOmay be evident during the first days of treatment and then decrease we will consider theproportion of SARS-nCoV-2 free patients during 28 days and compare the two groups in termsof treatment success with a log-rank test. Survival curves will be generated via the Kaplan-Meiermethod and compared with a log-rank test.Rates of organ dysfunction will be compared using Fisher\u2019s exact test. Ventilator-free days,ICUfree days, days free of vasopressors and time to negative SARS-CoV2 rt-PCR will be comparedusing the T-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Fisher\u2019s exact test will be used toestimate treatment differences in the incidence of each specified adverse event. No adjustmentswill be made for multiple hypothesis evaluations of safety endpoints. For all analyses, a 2-sidedalpha threshold of .05 will be considered significant.To adjust for additional influent factors not involved in the randomization process such as age,ARDS severity and co-administration of other experimental treatments, we will perform amultivariate logistic regession analysis on the primary outcome.Data quality and safety will be monitored by each site\u2019s PI, the study Medical CoordinatingCenter (MCC) and a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The site PIs will continuouslymonitor the data quality according to data quality measures. In addition, recruitment rate,deviation from inclusion/exclusion criteria and protocol, and confidentiality of data and databasewill be monitored. A DSMB, drawing from persons with expertise in the area will be constituted.An interim analysis will be performed at 50% of planned enrollment. The DSMB will evaluatesurvival rate between the two groups. The DSMB will determine whether the study shouldcontinue or terminate. The DSMB will play a valuable role in advising the study leadership onthe relevance of advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. A number of therapeutic ordiagnostic testing advances may possibly occur during the course of the trial. If protocolmodifications are warranted, close consultation among the DSMB and the study leadership willbe required. A separate DSMB charter that outlines in detail the operating guidelines for thecommittee and the protocol for evaluation of data will be developed prior to the start of patientrandomization and agreed upon in the initial meeting of the DSMB.Harms. Organ failure, prolonged hospitalization and mortality will be recorded as part of thestudy defined outcomes. Other adverse events will be monitored by the site PI and researchspecialist in real time from the start of randomization to hospital discharge or death. Reportableadverse events will include hemodynamic change and deterioration of oxygenation related to NOinhalation and require the adjustment of NO concentration. A serious adverse event in this studywill be defined as a reportable adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, or permanentlydisabling. All adverse events will be indicated on the data forms for the study and on the specificadverse event report forms and all serious adverse events will be reported to the site IRB within48 hours of the research team learning about the event followed by more detailed written reportto the local IRB. The following information about adverse events will be collected: 1) the onsetand resolution of the event, 2) an assessment of the severity or intensity of the event, 3) anassessment of the relationship of the event to the intervention, and 4) any action taken because ofevent. Sites will inform the principle investigators (CL and LB) at the coordinating centers(Xijing Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital) for any related adverse events directlycaused by inhalation of NO (non-serious) within 14 days of discovery. All fatal, life-threatening,or permanently disabling (regardless of relatedness) events due to inhalation of NO must bereported to the coordinating centers within 48 hours of discovery. The principle investigators willreport these events to the DSMB and to the coordinating centers IRBs.Patient and Public Involvement.
