The new name is also notconsistent with the disease nameCOVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, as a naturallyoccurring virus, is different fromall other SARS-like or SARS-relatedcoronaviruses, which are characterisedmainly by their genome sequence.As of Feb 17, 2020, 2019-nCoV hascaused 71 331 human infections and1775 deaths in China and 24 othercountries, and it is distinct fromSARS-CoV in biological,epidemiological, and clinical features.Naming 2019-nCoV as SARS-CoV-2is therefore truly misleading. Forsuch an epidemic virus with apparentinternational concern, it deserves itsown unique name.2019-nCoV is still evolving, and itis too early to predict the outcomeof the current outbreak. Someexperts predicted that 2019-nCoVcould evolve to a low pathogenicbut highly transmissible coronavirus,which might return every winter,like the virus that causes seasonalinfluenza.6 If this is the case, thename SARS-CoV-2 might haveadverse efects on the social stabilityand economic development incountries where the virus is causingan epidemic, perhaps even aroundthe world. People develop panic atthe thought of a re-occurrence ofSARS. Travellers and investors mightnot want to visit a country with anongoing epidemic or even sporadiccases of SARS. People may also believethat, like SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV willnot re-emerge once the currentoutbreak ends; therefore, they might notbe prepared to prevent 2019-nCoVinfection in the near future and couldlose a sense of alert.On the basis of special clinical,virological, and epidemiologicalcharacteristics and the uncertaintyof the novel coronavirus, to avoidthe misleadingness and confusion,and to help scientists and the publicwith better communication, we, agroup of virologists in China, suggestrenaming SARS-CoV-2 as humancoronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19).
