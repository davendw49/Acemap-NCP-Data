Cell entry of coronavirusesdepends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins tocellular receptors and on S protein priming by hostcell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factorsare used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provideinsights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutictargets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry andthe serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical useblocked entry and might constitute a treatmentoption. Finally, we show that the sera fromconvalescent SARS patients cross-neutralizedSARS-2S-driven entry. Our results reveal importantcommonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVinfection and identify a potential target for antiviralintervention.          Several members of the family Coronaviridae constantlycirculate in the human population and usually cause mild respiratorydisease                    In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory diseaseemerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China                    The spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilitates viral entry intotarget cells. Entry depends on binding of the surface unit, S1, ofthe S protein to a cellular receptor, which facilitates viralattachment to the surface of target cells. In addition, entry requires Sprotein priming by cellular proteases, which entails S proteincleavage at the S1/S2 and the S2\u2019 site and allows fusion of viraland cellular membranes, a process driven by the S2 subunit(Figure 1A). SARS-S engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as the entry receptor                    The goal of our study was to obtain insights into how SARS-2-Sfacilitates viral entry into target cells and how this process can beblocked. For this, we first asked whether SARS-2-S is robustlyexpressed in a human cell line, 293T, commonly used forexperimentation because of its high transfectability. Moreover, weanalyzed whether there is evidence for proteolytic processingof the S protein because certain coronavirus S proteins arecleaved by host cell proteases at the S1/S2 cleavage site ininfected cells (Figure 1A). Immunoblot analysis of 293T cellsexpressing SARS-2-S protein with a C-terminal antigenic tagrevealed a band with a molecular weight expected forunprocessed S protein (S0) (Figure 1B). A band with a size expectedfor the S2 subunit of the S protein was also observed in cellsand, more prominently, in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)particles bearing SARS-2-S (Figure 1B). In contrast, an S2 signalwas largely absent in cells and particles expressing SARS-S(Figure 1B), as previously documented                    Replication-defective VSV particles bearing coronavirus Sproteins faithfully reflect key aspects of coronavirus host cell entry                    In order to elucidate why SARS-S and SARS-2-S mediated entryinto the same cell lines, we next determined whether SARS-2-Sharbors amino acid residues required for interaction with theSARS-S entry receptor ACE2. Sequence analysis revealed thatSARS-CoV-2 clusters with SARS-CoV-related viruses frombats (SARSr-CoV), of which some but not all can use ACE2 forhost cell entry (Figure 2A; Figure S2). Analysis of the receptorbinding motif (RBM), a portion of the receptor binding domain(RBD) that makes contact with ACE2                    We next investigated protease dependence of SARS-CoV-2entry. SARS-CoV can use the endosomal cysteine proteasescathepsin B and L (CatB/L)                    In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can use CatB/L forcell entry, we initially employed ammonium chloride, whichelevates endosomal pH and thereby blocks CatB/L activity. 293Tcells (TMPRSS2 , transfected to express ACE2 for robust Sprotein-driven entry) and Caco-2 cells (TMPRSS2+) were used astargets. Ammonium chloride blocked VSV-G-dependent entryinto both cell lines whereas entry driven by Nipah virus F and Gproteins was not affected (Figure S3A; data not shown),consistent with Nipah virus but not VSV being able to fuse directly withthe plasma membrane          We next analyzed whether TMPRSS2 usage is required forSARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells. Indeed, camostat mesylatesignificantly reduced MERS-S-, SARS-S-, and SARS-2-S- butnot VSV-G-driven entry into the lung cell line Calu-3 (Figure 4C)and exerted no unwanted cytotoxic effects (Figure S3 C).Similarly, camostat mesylate treatment significantly reduced Calu-3infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4D). Finally,camostat mesylate treatment inhibited SARS-S- and SARS-2-S- butnot VSV-G-driven entry into primary human lung cells (Figure 4E).Collectively, SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 for S proteinpriming and camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, blocksSARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells.          Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibodyresponse directed against the viral S protein          The present study provides evidence that host cell entry ofSARSCoV-2 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and can beblocked by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular serineprotease TMPRSS2, which is employed by SARS-CoV-2 for S proteinpriming. Moreover, it suggests that antibody responses raisedagainst SARS-CoV could at least partially protect againstSARSCoV-2 infection. These results have important implications forour understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility andpathogenesis and reveal a target for therapeutic intervention.          The finding that SARS-2-S exploits ACE2 for entry, which wasalso reported by Zhou and colleagues                    The average of three independent experiments conducted with triplicatesamples is shown in (A\u2013C). Error bars indicate SEM. Statistical significancewas tested by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett posttest. Cells transfected withempty vector served as reference in (A) whereas cells that were not treatedwith antibody served as reference in (B).(legend on next page)to be compared. It has been suggested that the modest ACE2expression in the upper respiratory tract                    Priming of coronavirus S proteins by host cell proteases isessential for viral entry into cells and encompasses S proteincleavage at the S1/S2 and the S20 sites. The S1/S2 cleavagesite of SARS-2-S harbors several arginine residues (multibasic),which indicates high cleavability. Indeed, SARS-2-S wasefficiently cleaved in cells, and cleaved S protein was incorporatedinto VSV particles. Notably, the cleavage site sequence candetermine the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses                    The S proteins of SARS-CoV can use the endosomal cysteineproteases CatB/L for S protein priming in TMPRSS2 cells                    Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibodyresponse that can be detected even 24 months after infection          In sum, this study provided key insights into the first step ofSARS-CoV-2 infection, viral entry into cells, and definedpotential targets for antiviral intervention.Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paperand include the following:d KEY RESOURCES TABLEd LEAD CONTACT AND MATERIALS AVAILABILITYd EXPERIMANTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILSB Cell cultures, primary cells, viral strainsd METHOD DETAILSB PlasmidsB Pseudotyping of VSV and transduction experimentsB Quantification of cell viabilityB Phylogenetic analysisd QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSISd DATA AND CODE AVAILABILITYACKNOWLEDGMENTSparticleand 01KI1723A to C.D. and S.P.) and German Research Foundation (DFG)(WU 929/1-1 to N.-H.W.).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSConceptualization, M.H. and S.P.; Formal analysis, M.H., H.K.-W., M.A.M.,and S.P.; Investigation, M.H., H.K.-W., S.S., N.K., T.H., N.-H.W., andM.A.M.; Resources, T.H., S.E., T.S.S., G.H., A.N., M.A.M., and C.D.; Writing\u2013 Original Draft, M.H. and S.P.; Writing \u2013 Review & Editing, all authors; Fundingacquisition, S.P., N.-H.W., and C.D.We thank Heike Hofmann-Winkler for discussion, Andrea Maisner for Nipah Fand G expression plasmids, Anette Teichmann for technical assistance, andRoberto Cattaneo for plasmid pCG1.

Lung tissue samples were obtained and experimental procedures were performed within the frameworkof the non-profit foundation HTCR, including the informed patient\u2019s consent.          For preparation of human airway epithelial cells, bronchus tissue was derived from patients undergoing pulmonary resection andwas provided by the Biobank of the Department of General, Visceral, and Transplant Surgery, Ludwig-Maximilians- UniversityMunich. Primary human airway epithelial cells were subsequently isolated as described          For infection experiments with SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Munich 929 was propagated in VeroE6 cells (passage 1) afterprimary isolation from patient material on Vero-TMPRSS2 cells (passage 0).          Expression plasmids for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, serotype Indiana) glycoprotein (VSV-G), Nipah virus (NiV) fusion (F)and attachment glycoprotein (G), SARS-S (derived from the Frankfurt-1 isolate) with or without a C-terminal HA epitope tag,HCoV-229E-S, MERS-S, human and bat angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), human aminopeptidase N (APN), humandipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) and human TMPRSS2 have been described elsewhere                    For pseudotyping, VSV pseudotypes were generated according to a published protocol          For transduction, target cells were grown in 96-well plates until they reached 50%\u201375% confluency before they were inoculatedwith respective pseudotyped VSV. For experiments addressing receptor usage, cells were transfected with expression plasmids 24 hbefore transduction. In order to block ACE2 on the cell surface, cells were pretreated with 2 or 20 mg/mL anti-ACE2 antibody (R&DSystems, goat, AF933). As control, an unrelated anti-DC-SIGN antibody (Serotec, goat, 20 mg/mL) was used. For experimentsinvolving ammonium chloride (final concentration 50 mM) and protease inhibitors (E-64d, 25 mM; camostat mesylate, 1-500 mM),target cells were treated with the respective chemical 2 h before transduction. For neutralization experiments, pseudotypes werepre-incubated for 30 min at 37 C with different serum dilutions. Transduction efficiency was quantified 16 h posttransduction bymeasuring the activity of firefly luciferase in cell lysates using a commercial substrate (Beetle-Juice, PJK) and a Hidex Sense plateluminometer (Hidex).Cell viability following treatment of Calu-3 cells with camostat mesylate was analyzed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent CellViability Assay (Promega). In brief, Calu-3 cells grown to 50% confluency in 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h in the absenceor presence of different concentrations (1-500 mM) of camostat mesylate. Next, the culture medium was aspirated and 100 ml of freshculture medium was added before an identical volume of the assay substrate was added. Wells containing only culture mediumserved as a control to determine the assay background. After 2 min of incubation on a rocking platform and additional 10 min withoutmovement, samples were transferred into white opaque-walled 96-well plates and luminescent signal were recorded using a HidexSense plate luminometer (Hidex).To analyze S protein expression in cells, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for HA-tagged SARS-2-S or SARS-S orempty expression vector (negative control). The culture medium was replaced at 16 h posttransfection and the cells were incubatedfor an additional 24 h. Then, the culture medium was removed and cells were washed once with PBS before 2x SDS-sample buffer(0.03 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 1 mM EDTA) was added and cells were incubated for 10 min atroom temperature. Next, the samples were heated for 15 min at 96 C and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.For analysis of S protein incorporation into pseudotyped particles, 1 mL of the respective VSV pseudotypes were loaded onto a20% (w/v) sucrose cushion (volume 50 ml) and subjected to high-speed centrifugation (25.000 g for 120 min at 4 C). Thereafter, 1 mLof supernatant was removed and the residual volume was mixed with 50 ml of 2x SDS-sample buffer, heated for 15 min at 96 C andsubjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. After protein transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk solution(5% skim milk dissolved in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated over night at4 C with the primary antibody (diluted in in skim milk solution)). Following three washing intervals of 10 min in PBS-T the membraneswere incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody (diluted in in skim milk solution), before the membranes werewashed and imaged using an in in house-prepared enhanced chemiluminescent solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8.6], 250 mg/mL luminol,1 mg/mL para-hydroxycoumaric acid, 0.3% H2O2) and the ChemoCam imaging system along with the ChemoStar Professionalsoftware (Intas Science Imaging Instruments GmbH). The following primary antibodies were used: Mouse anti-HA tag (Sigma-Aldrich,H3663, 1:2,500), mouse anti-b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, A5441, 1:2,000), mouse anti-VSV matrix protein (Kerafast, EB0011, 1:2,500).As secondary antibody we used a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, 115-035-003, 1:10000).          BHK-21 cells (1.6 x105 cells/mL) were transfected with ACE2 and DsRed as a negative control. After 24 h, cells were washed withPBS and infected with 8x107 genome equivalents (GE) per 24-well of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Munich 929 for 1 h at 37 C. Calu-3 cells(5 x105 cells/mL) were mock treated or treated with 100 mM camostat mesylate (Sigma Aldrich) 2 h prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2isolate Munich 929 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 for 1 h at 37 C. After infection, cells were washed three times with PBSbefore 500 ml of DMEM medium was added. At 16 or 24 h post infection, 50 ml culture supernatant was subjected to viral RNAextraction using a viral RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. GE per ml were detected by real timeRTPCR using a previously reported protocol                    The convalescent human anti-SARS-CoV sera (CSS-2 to CSS-5) stemmed from the serum collection of the national consiliarylaboratory for coronavirus diagnostics at Charite\u00b4 , Berlin, Germany or the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany. All sera were previouslytested positive using a recombinant S-based immunofluorescence test          Phylogenetic analysis (neighbor-joining tree, bootstrap method with 5,000 iterations, Poisson substitution model, uniform ratesamong sites, complete deletion of gaps/missing data) was performed using the MEGA7.0.26 software. Reference sequenceswere obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data)databases. Reference numbers are indicated in the figures.One-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett posttest was used to test for statistical significance. Only p values of0.05 or lower were considered statistically significant (p > 0.05 [ns, not significant], p % 0.05 [*], p % 0.01 [**], p % 0.001 [***]). For allstatistical analyses, the GraphPad Prism 7 software package was used (GraphPad Software).Figure S2.

A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical useblocked entry and might constitute a treatmentoption. Indeed, camostat mesylatesignificantly reduced MERS-S-, SARS-S-, and SARS-2-S- butnot VSV-G-driven entry into the lung cell line Calu-3 (Figure 4C)and exerted no unwanted cytotoxic effects (Figure S3 C).Similarly, camostat mesylate treatment significantly reduced Calu-3infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4D). Convalescent SARS patients exhibit a neutralizing antibodyresponse directed against the viral S protein          The present study provides evidence that host cell entry ofSARSCoV-2 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and can beblocked by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular serineprotease TMPRSS2, which is employed by SARS-CoV-2 for S proteinpriming. Statistical significancewas tested by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett posttest. Indeed, SARS-2-S wasefficiently cleaved in cells, and cleaved S protein was incorporatedinto VSV particles.
