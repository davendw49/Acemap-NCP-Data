A previous importation of2019-nCoV in a family cluster inVietnam included a father returningfrom Wuhan who transmitted thevirus to his wife and son. They allrecovered in less than 2 weeks.5 Intwo cohorts in China (n=41, n=99),the case fatality rates were 15%,1 and11%.7 Some reports have indicatedthat few patients with 2019-nCoVinfection have prominent upperrespiratory tract signs and symptoms(eg, sore throat),1,7 as occurred withthe Nepalese student. As expected,fever and cough are the main clinicalfindings in patients with confirmed2019-nCoV infection, with up to aquarter requiring admission to theintensive care unit.Further studies in outpatient,primary care, and community settingsare needed to get a full spectrumof clinical severity in imported,secondary, or autochthonous casesin all countries. These studies will beincreasingly relevant as more casesof 2019-nCoV are diagnosed amongpeople returning from Wuhan andother afected cities in China, but alsoacquiring the infection from importedcases, even asymptomatic ones, asoccurred in Germany.8We declare no competing interests.        Published Online An important determinant of whetherFebruary        The key quantity governingwhether or not 2019-nCoV canestablish and generate a sustainedoutbreak on arrival in a new countryis the reproduction number, R, whichrepresents the average number ofindividuals that each infector willtransmit the virus to. If R is greaterthan 1, sustained transmission canoccur; if R is less than 1, then chains oftransmission will simply stutter out.In the ongoing outbreak, assumingan R of 2\u00b72, as reported by Li andcolleagues,1 then just over half ofinfections must be prevented to bringR below 1. This might be expected tobe challenging if 2019-nCoV can betransmitted when infectors are notsymptomatic.However, there is little evidence tosuggest presymptomatic transmissionof 2019-nCoV.2 Even if 20% ofinfections are occurring becauseof presymptomatic infectors (alevel roughly halfway between therespective values for severe acuterespiratory syndrome and influenzaviruses,3 which is likely to be anoverestimate), then 80% of infectionswould be due to symptomaticinfectors. Because only slightly morethan half of infections need to beprevented to bring R below 1, efectiveisolation of symptomatic hostsalone should be suficient to preventsustained outbreaks of 2019-nCoVoutside China.Of course, detection and isolationof symptomatic hosts is not alwayscarried out efectively, and detectionis challenging when symptoms aremild. Therefore, efforts to counterpresymptomatic transmission mightsometimes be merited. However,when implementing such measures(eg, the UK\u2019s isolation of passengersreturning from Hubei, infected or not),the substantial cost to individuals whomight not be carrying the virus shouldbe considered carefully. With fastisolation of symptomatic individualsalone, including self-isolation ofthose with mild symptoms, sustainedoutbreaks outside of China can beprevented.I declare no competing interests.Christ Church, University of Oxford,Oxford OX1 1DP, UK1 Li Q, Guan X, Wu P, et al.
