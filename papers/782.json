We expressed threeversions of spike (S) proteins\u2014receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 subunit and Sectodomain\u2014in insect cells. RBD appears monomer in solutions, whereas S1 and Sassociate into homotrimer with substantial glycosylation. The three proteins conferexcellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera. Cryo-electronmicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer dominate in aunique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusion conformation ofcoronaviruses by the upper S1 region at lower position ~15 \u00c5 proximal to viralmembrane. Such conformation is proposed as an early prefusion state for theSARSCoV-2 spike that may broaden the knowledge of coronavirus and facilitate vaccineearly prefusion conformation404142434445464748495051525354555657585960The novel coronavirus grouped in betacoronavirus genus has become the third seriousvirus intruder to human in the coronaviridae, after sever acute respiratory syndromecoronaviruses (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV), recently named SARS-CoV-2. In the phylogenic tree of thecoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to some bat coronavirus andSARSCoV, however, with its origin undefined1. SARS-CoV-2 causative disease\"Coronavirus disease 2019\" (abbreviated \"COVID-19\") is characterized by high fever,dry cough, difficulty breathing and sever atypical pneumonia, which usually beconfirmed by virus RNA positive or pulmonary computed tomography (CT) in clinicalpractice2, 3. In terms of higher human-to-human transmissibility, SARS-CoV-2 hasspread over 118 countries and areas, and led to over 125,288 confirmed casesworldwide and at least 4,614 deaths, as of March 12th 2020. The World HealthOrganization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic as a pandemic ofinternational concern and updates the COVID-19 situation every day.SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virusencapsulated with a genome of ~30 kb. At least three membrane proteins including thesurface spike protein (S), an integral membrane protein (M), a membrane protein (E).Like other coronaviruses, S is responsible for initiating the engagement to a specificcellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and mediating the cell-virusmembrane fusion by the class I fusion mechanism4, 5. Thus, S is the main target forneutralizing antibodies against viral infection and the core immunogen constituent of626364656667686970717273747576777879808182vaccine design. S is consisted of S1 and S2 subunits and the cleavage on S1/S2boundary by protease during biosynthesis is prerequisite for coronaviruses cellularmembrane fusion and subsequent infection6. SARS-CoV-2 evolves a 4-residueinsertion (RRAR) as potential furin cleavage site rather than SARS-CoV and other batcoronaviruses, which may contribute to the higher transmissibility of this novelcoronavirus6, 7. Previous studies suggested the infection process of MERS-CoV8 andSARS9 viruses, where S trimer undergoes conformational transition from a prefusionconformation ready for ACE2 binding to a postfusion conformation for eventualviruscell membrane fusion. Structure determination of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spiketrimers captured a variety of scenarios in the prefusion conformation showing partial(one or two) receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the \u201cup\u201d conformation and the rest inthe \u201cdown\u201d, and all in either \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d. The conformation transition from \u201cdown\u201dto \u201cup\u201d could expose the receptor binding site, and the subsequent receptor engagementwould lead to a substantial conformation rearrangement of S trimer from prefusionconformation to postfusion. Two recent studies7, 10 reported cryo-electron microscope(cryo-EM) structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers in the prefusion conformation with2 RBDs down and 1 RBD up. In the case of SARS-CoV, this conformational changeduring RBDs \u201cdown\u201d to \u201cup\u201d was associated with the binding of receptor ACE2 as wellas the recognition of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 11.A safe and efficacious vaccine is urgently needed to control and eliminate theSARS-CoV-2 infection. Various forms of vaccine candidates, mostly aiming to elicitneutralizing antibodies against S proteins, are under preclinical research or even84858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104subjected to clinical trials12. Here, we cloned S ectodomain and its fragments RBD andS1 into recombinant baculovirus and expressed the proteins in insect cells. We foundthat S and S1 formed homotrimer in solutions and the three proteins reacted well withCOVID-19 convalescent human sera. Cryo-EM analysis demonstrated the S trimerunexpectedly retains a unique conformation distinguished from the classic prefusionconformation of coronavirus spikes, that may represent an early state rather than theknown prefusion conformation of S spike. These results might broaden the knowledgeon coronavirus virology and provide another protective conformation of S trimer forstructure-based vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 infection and its causativeTo screen a potent immunogen for COVID-19 vaccine development, we designed threeconstructs\u2014S ectodomain, S1 and RBD\u2014for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) proteinexpression by aligning the SARS-CoV-2 S gene (Genbank accession no. NC_045512.2)to a SARS-CoV strain (Genbank accession no. NC_004718) S gene sequence in termsof structure-defined domain profile of the SARS-CoV S protein (Fig. 1A). The gene ofSARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain encoding amino acids (aa) 15-1,213 with removal of itsoriginal signal sequence was cloned to the downstream of the gp67 signal sequence inpAcgp67B plasmid vector (Fig.1B). and with its C-terminal addition of a thrombincleavage site, a T4 trimerization foldon motif and his tag. The segments S1 (aa15106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126680) and RBD (aa 319-541) were cloned similar to S ectodomain, keeping gp67 signalpeptide and his tag to facilitate secretory outside cell and affinity purification,respectively, but without the thrombin site and T4 foldon (Fig. 1A). The threeconstructed plasmids were respectively co-transfected into Sf9 insect cells withvcath/chiA gene deficient baculovirus DNA for the generation and amplification ofrecombinant baculovirus, which were then harnessed to infect Hive Five insect cells toeventually produce recombinant proteins, named S, S1 and RBD respectively.The recombinant proteins were mostly soluble expressed and secreted into theculture medium. The centrifugation supernatants of cell culture went through metalaffinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin. S, S1 and RBD proteins were mainlyeluted in a separation fractions under 250 mM imidazole elution, and resolved asmolecular weight (m.w.) of ~180 kDa, 110 kDa and 35 kDa, respectively, inSDSPAGE as indicated by a corresponding western blotting (WB) using anti-His antibodyas detection antibody (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, about one half S proteins were cleavedinto S1 (identical migration site to S1 lane in Fig. 1C) and S2 (about 80kDa developedin anti-His WB) possibly by innate furin of insect cell that was also found in other casesof enzymatic cleave while protein expression in insect cell, such as Flu HA 13. Theeluted S fraction was further polished by Superdex 200 to remove contaminativeproteins (Fig. 1D). These peaks fractionated at retention volume 28mL, 36mL, 48mL,and 65mL, were further harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The resultsindicated that S proteins together with cleaved S1/S2 were resolved at peak 1 insizeexclusion chromatography (Fig. 1D) and showed a high purity of over 95% total128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148S/S1/S2 in gel (Fig. 1E). Overall, one-step Ni-NTA affinity chromatography producedRBD with 95% purity and a yield of 30 mg per L cell culture, S1 with about 90% purityand 10 mg per L yield, while further purification through a size-exclusionchromatography (SEC), the resultant S sample had over 95% purity regarding intact Sand cleaved S1/S2, and was harvested in a yield of 1 mg per L cell culture. These dataset up a start point for further optimization on expression and purification process ofSARS-CoV-2 S immunogen candidates through insect baculovirus expression vectorsystem (BEVS).We next investigated the physiochemical properties of the recombinant S protein andits fragments purified from insect cells, including association potential, thermalstabilityandglycosylationhighpressurechromatography (HPSEC) and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation(SV-AUC) analyses were carried out to measure the oligomerization potential of thethree proteins in solution. RBD, S1 and S all showed single major peak in HPSECprofiles at elution volume of 9.0 mL, 5.5 and 5.3 mL, respectively (Fig. 2A and Fig.2B). RBD, S1 and S were further verified by SV-AUC, where RBD sedimented assingle species of 3.1S in c(s) profile, corresponding to apparent molecular weight 22kDa (Fig. 2D); S1 existed as a dominant species of 11.3 S (estimated as 277 kDacorresponding to S1 trimer) and a minor aggregate form of 20 S (Fig. 2E); S and cleavedS1/S2 resolved as 15.2 S, equivalent to 577 kDa, approximately as the theoretical150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170molecular weight of intact S trimer. The three proteins were further analyzed bydifferential scanning calorimetry (DSC) that was usually used to investigate the innerthermostability of macromolecules or their complexes14. RBD and S1 showed onemajor peak at comparable thermal denaturation midpoints (Tm) of 46.0 \u00b0C and 45.5 \u00b0C,respectively (Fig. 3G and 3H), whereas S sample showed two major peaks at Tm of45.5\u00b0C (identical to Tm of S1) and 64.5\u00b0C (Fig. 3I), which might reflect the coexistenceof intact S and cleaved S1/S2.On the other hand, we investigated the glycosylation extent of the three protein byenzymatic deglycosylation analysis. Endo H could unleash the chithobiose core of highmannose and some hybrid oligosaccharides from N-liked glycoproteins, thereforeremove the extended branches of glycans and leave the one N acetylglucosamine(GlcNAc) on N-linked glycoproteins. While PNGase F would release N-linked glycanmoieties between GlcNAc and ASN residues within a glycoprotein. It should be notedthat glycosylation in insect cells is featured as terminal mannose glycans, unlikecomplex sialylated glycans in mammalian cells, and glycosylation is known to correlatethe immunogenicity and broad-coverage protection of a glycoprotein immunogen15, 16.After the treatment of either Endo H or PNGase F, RBD showed no discernible decreaseof molecular weight in SDS-PAGE/anti-His WB, S1 and S2 both demonstrated nearly~10 kDa decrease, and the intact S exhibited substantial shrinkage in molecular weightof about ~20 kDa decrease (Fig. 2J). The analyses conclude that the glycosylationextent within S glycoprotein is RBD < S1 ~ S2, consistent to the predicted glycosylationprofile of S polypeptide (Fig. 1A).Reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD, S1 and S proteins against convalescentCOVIDWe next evaluated the antigenicity of the three versions of S proteins by WB and ELISAusing a panel of six COVID-19 convalescent human sera, which was collected fromCOVID-19 patients after they recovered from the disease in the First Affiliated Hospitalof Xiamen University. Eight reducing SDS gel duplicates of the one depicted in Fig.1C were prepared for WB analysis using these six convalescent sera and two controlsera from health human (Fig. 3A-3H, left panel). As expected, intact S protein bandsreacted well with all the six convalescent sera (Fig. 3A-3H, left panel). Unexpectedly,five of six sera showed no or very weak reactivities against RBD, only Serum #6possessed RBD's activity. Among the five sera with lower RBD-reactivity, Serum #2,#3 and #5 well recognized S1 and the cleaved S1 in lane S, suggesting these sera mayspecifically react with NTD of S1. S2 demonstrated reaction activity against all the sixsera, like the intact S. No detectable reaction was observed in the control sera (Fig. 3Gand 3H). Inconsistent to the WB results, RBD, S1 and S shared comparable reactivitiesagainst the convalescent sera in ELISA, although the sera per se presented variedreaction titers (represented as ET50) following the reaction sequence: Serum #5 > #2 >Taken together, RBD, S1 and S proteins from insect cells maintain the native-likeSARS-CoV-2 epitopes. These epitopes in native virion should be immunogenic inCOVID-19 patients and capable of eliciting high antibody titer in the convalescent194195196197198199200201202203204205206207208209210211212213214phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these epitopes, most RBD epitopes are strictlytertiary conformation-dependent sites that are damaged upon the mild denaturedcondition of reductant and SDS treatment, NTD within S1 bears some linear epitopes,whereas S2 part essentially has linear epitopes that are immunogenic in all COVID-19patients (n=6).To examine the structure of the trimeric S ectodomain with native sequence, weprepared cryo-EM grids using the Ni-NTA purified S proteins and collected 1,513electron micrograph movies. Most of motion-corrected micrographs demonstratedplenty of well-dispersed particles with an approximate size as the canonical coronavirusS trimer (Fig. 4A). A total of 162,645 particles were picked out for multiple rounds of2D classification, consequently, 37,147 particles grouped into top 10 classes, renderingtypical feature of S trimer in prefusion conformation as recently reported7, 10, wereselected for further analysis (Fig. 4B). 3D reconstruction (applying 3-fold symmetry)yielded the density map of prefusion spike (S-pre) at resolution of 5.43 \u00c5 (Fig. 3D andStructurally, three S monomers intertwine around each other and associate tohomotrimers with 145 \u00c5 height seen from side-view and 160 \u00c5 diameter in top-view(Fig. 4C and 4D). We then recruited the recently reported cryo-EM map of S prefusiontrimer (EMD-21374, at resolution of 3.17 \u00c5, low pass to 5.43 \u00c5 prior to structuralcomparison) and compared our cryo-EM map at same resolution (Fig. 4D). It was216217218219220221222223224225226227228229230231232233234235worthy noted that the compared prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S trimer was engineered withsite-directed mutations to stabilize prefusion conformation and expressed in 239F cells.The mutant included two stabilizing proline mutations at residues 986, 987 and a\u201cGSAS\u201d substitution at the furin cleavage site7. Surprisingly, the alignmentdemonstrated that the two cryo-EM structures share similar mushroom-shapedarchitecture in particular nearly identical at stalk moiety (S2 region), but our S-preshows the cap part (S1 region) at ~15\u00c5 lower position than the reported S trimer inRBD-down prefusion conformation (Fig. 4D). Regarding to substantial mismatch at thedensity of 3 S1 subunits, we respectively fitted 5 individual domains (NTD, RBD, SD1,SD2 and S2) of the SARS-CoV-2 S structure (PDB code 6VSB) to our S-pre map. Inthe fitting map, NTD, RBD, SD2 and S2 could be well placed in the S-pre map,especially for the latter two, which reflects the aforementioned good match at the stalkof the mushroom-shape (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, there is no observabledensity between RBD and SD2 to accommodate an SD1 model (Supplementary Fig. 2),which suggests SD1 region is dramatically flexible in our S-pre structure (Fig. 4E and4F). When the combined model of fitted NTD-RBD-SD2-S2 was superimposed to theoriginal S protomer structure (PDB code 6VSB, Chain A, RBD in down conformation),both NTD and RBD in the original S obviously move and rotate up against ourcombined model (Fig. 4G). The structural comparison demonstrated that the S-pretrimer retains a unique conformation different from the prefusion conformation of thetwo reported SARS-CoV-2 spike structures (PDB codes 6VSB and 6VXX).237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251252253254255256257We then compared the conformation of our S-pre structure with that of 21deposited coronavirus S models. Six representative S structures7, 17-20 from four knowngenus (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-genus) in coronaviridae are respectively fitted to the S-pre map(Supplementary Fig. 3). Five S trimer structures of other coronaviruses share similarprefusion conformation with the reported SARS-CoV-2 S structure but substantiallydistinct with the unique conformation of our S-pre.Apart from most particles classified as S-pre in our sample, 2D classifications alsoshowed five classes of few particles (2,951) assuming an elongated rosette-shapeassembly. These particles were further reconstructed and yielded a structure at lowerresolution of 8.40 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 1B) that could be considered as post-fusionspike (S-post), as the structure has similar shape but shorter length (~170 \u00c5) ascompared to the postfusion spike of SARS-CoV21 and the presumed one observed innative SARS-CoV-2 virion (BioRxiv, https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.972927)(Supplementary Fig. 4) . Fitting the S-post map with the core region structure ofSARCoV-2 S2 subunit in post-fusion conformation (PDB code 6LXT) indicated that ourSpost exhibits roughly rod shape similar with the post-fusion structure (SupplementaryConformational transition of SARS-CoV-2 spike from early prefusion toBriefly, we\u2019ve obtained two conformations of SARS-CoV-2 spike from insect cells.The dominant one maintains the similar mushroom-shaped trimer as the previous259260261262263264265266267268269270271272273274275276277278279models, while the S1 region substantially diverges. The other conformation essentiallyresembles the postfusion state. However, we could not find the classic prefusionconformation in our sample. We next tried to figure out at which stage the uniqueconformation occurs during the spike conformation change. The space relationship ofNTD or RBD to S2 domain in the unique, RBD-down and RBD-up prefusionconformations (Fig. 5A) was measured by a reference plant approximately parallel tothe viral membrane. The plane is defined by the positions of three equivalent C\u03b1 atoms(residue 694 be used) from three S2 subunits of the trimer structures. Numerical datashows that (1) the NTD and RBD in the unique conformation retain the lowest positionin the three prefusion conformations; (2) the NTD and RBD of RBD-down prefusionstretch upward 16.6\u00b0 rotation/16 \u00c5 elevation, and 13.1\u00b0/18 \u00c5, respectively, with respectto the unique conformation; (3) from RBD-down to RBD-up prefusion state, the RBDelevates 9 \u00c5 with an additional rotation whereas the NTD remaining nearly stationary(Supplementary Movie S1). The resultant \u201cup\u201d RBD is ready for ACE2 binding andthe spike eventually is rearranged to postfusion state upon RBD-ACE2 interaction11, 22(Fig. 5B). The motion trend of NTD and RBD from prefusion to postfusion state inconformational transition is away from the viral membrane, suggesting the uniqueconformation may occur earlier than RBD-down prefusion conformation, named as\u201cearly prefusion conformation\u201d (Fig. 5). This early prefusion conformation might exist281282283284285286287288289290291292293294295296297298299300301SARS-CoV-2 has crossed the species barrier and sweep over the planet byperson-toperson transmission in an R0 ~2.56 rate23, first wave in China and the second wavebooming outside China. WHO has declared the event as another pandemic infectiousdisease in human history, and the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still indata accumulation. Although the biology and virology of SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive,in terms of knowledge on other coronaviruses, the spikes decorating the SARS-CoV-2virion play a critical role in viral attachment and entry to host cells. Cryo-EM structuresof spikes in the prefusion conformation, and RBD-bound receptor ACE2 have indicatedthe engagement of SARS-CoV-2 to cellular membrane requires a serial ofconformational change of RBDs. The change is presumed from the start point of 3RBDs down in the prefusion conformation, then RBD(s) up for ACE2 binding, andeventually spike is rearranged to postfusion. In this study, we suggest that theSARSCoV-2 spike may retain at more precedent state than the classic prefusion conformationthat has been determined for other coronaviruses. This early prefusion conformationfeatures that the cap of the mushroom-shaped spike constituted by three S1 subunits ismore proximal to viral membrane by 15 \u00c5 than in the classic prefusion conformation.The SARS-CoV-2 spike expressed in insect cells predominantly retains a uniqueearly prefusion conformation, which was repeatable in at least three batches of samplesand is ascribed to two possible reasons \u2013 native aa sequence used in the S ectodomainconstruct and over-expression in insect cells. There is about a half of S proteinsundergoing cleavage on the S1/S2 boundary site in the purified samples both after the303304305306307308309310311312313314315316317318319320321322323first Ni-NAT and the second SEC purification (Fig. 1C and 1E). Further analysessuggest the split between S1 and S2 likely takes no effect on the trimerization of Strimer. It is known that the insect cells can confer post-translation glycosylation forprotein over-expression as mammalian cells despite the latter can produce morecomplex sialyation24, and thus provide an alternative way to generate glycoprotein innative conformation. Our results indicate that RBD, NTD and S2 domains ofSARSCoV-2 demonstrated different glycosylation extent in insect cells, however, RBD, S1and S proteins comparably react well with six convalescent COVID-19 human seraalbeit they differ in domain composition, polypeptide length and oligomerization.There are numbers of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, including inactivated,vectored, recombinant and nucleotide vaccine forms, under preclinical research.Various versions of S proteins are the major targets for vaccine immunogen candidate.In addition to potent neutralizing antibody elicitation upon immunization, potentialantibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE) is the major concern for an efficaciousSARS-CoV-2 vaccine. ADE has been found in the development of numbers of virusvaccine candidates, including respiratory syndrome virus (RSV), dengue fever 25, 26,human immunodeficient virus (HIV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV 25-27 and so on. It isbelieved that ADE is associated with non-neutralization epitope attribute and / orspecific antibody isotype28, 29, in which virus-bound antibody would promote the viralinfection to immune cells through Fc fragment targeting \u03b3Fc receptors on the cellularsurface and enhance the disease severity. Therefore, the strategy of vaccine designagainst SARS-CoV-2 should include the consideration of antigen region selection,325326327328329330331332333334335336337338339340341342343344345glycosylation number/extent and exactly presented prefusion conformation. Theprefusion conformation needed to be maintained is exemplified by the case of RSVvaccine candidate in which F trimer in prefusion is much potent than postfusion. Hencethe early prefusion conformation proposed for SARS-CoV-2 spike should be drawn anattention for immunogen design as well as the prefusion one.In conclusion, we obtain three kinds of S proteins showing excellent antigenicityand find an early prefusion conformation for SARS-CoV-2 spike. Nevertheless, themolecular level detail for such conformation and the underlying immunogenicityshould be further investigated, and whether this conformation recapitulates the exactstate of spike in native SARS-CoV-2 virion remains to be determined.The SARS-CoV-2 S gene (Genbank accession no. NC_045512.2) was synthesized andcloned into a baculovirus shuttle vector pAcgp67B (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) usingGibson assembly. The S construct encoding aa 15-1,213 (numbered as originalsequence), contains a thrombin site, a T4 foldon domain to assist in trimerization and aC-terminal 10-His tag for purification. For S1 construct contains gene encoding aa15680 followed by a 10-His tag. The RBD construct (aa 319-541) also contains 10-his tagto facilitate purification.

All plasmids were co-transfected with linearized 2.0 DNA (deficient invcath/chiAgenes) (Expression Systems, CA, USA) into Sf9 insect cells (Thermo FisherScientific, MA, USA), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer(Expression Systems). The transfection supernatant was harvested and amplified 2times to obtain a high titer of the recombinant viruses. Hive Five cells(BTI-TN-5B14) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured in ESF921 medium (Expression Systems)and infected with recombinant virus at an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 in theexponential growth phase (2\u00d7 106 cells/ml, 95% viability) at 28\u00b0C for 72 h. The culturemedia was centrifugated at 8,000 rpm for 20 min. Then the supernatant was dialyzedagainst phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and purified with Ni-sepharose fastflow 6 resin (GE Healthcare, Boston, USA) by the elution with 250 mM imidazole. Theprotein concentrations of the final purified samples were measured with Pierce\u2122BCAProtein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Protein samples were mixed with loading buffer and boiled for 10 min, and subjectedto sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Equalamounts of proteins for each sample were loaded onto two SDS-PAGE gels, one forwestern blotting and one for Coomassie staining. The proteins were electrophoresed for70 min at 80 V in a BioRad MINI-PROTEAN Tetra system (BioRad Laboratories, CA,USA), and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) for 30369370371372373374375376377378379380381382383384385386387388389min at room temperature. For western blotting, separated proteins were transferred ontoa nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) using a Trans-Blot Turbotransfer system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked and then incubated for 1 h withan His-tag-specific mouse mAb antibody (Proteintech, Rosemont, USA) or human sera(1:500 dilution). Unbound antibody was removed by five 5-min washes and themembrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mousesecondary antibody or goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge,UK). Membranes were washed again and then developed using SuperSignal ELISAPico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Purified proteins were coated onto 96-well microtiter plates at 100 ng/well in PBS at37\u00b0C for 4 h. The background was blocked with 1 \u00d7 Enzyme dilution buffer (PBS +0.25% casein + 1% gelatin + 0.05% proclin-300) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Sera were dilutedstarted at 1:100 followed with three-fold serially dilution, and added to the wells (100 \u00b5l)and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h.

The recombinant proteins were mostly soluble expressed and secreted into theculture medium. These peaks fractionated at retention volume 28mL, 36mL, 48mL,and 65mL, were further harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Eight reducing SDS gel duplicates of the one depicted in Fig.1C were prepared for WB analysis using these six convalescent sera and two controlsera from health human (Fig. Inconsistent to the WB results, RBD, S1 and S shared comparable reactivitiesagainst the convalescent sera in ELISA, although the sera per se presented variedreaction titers (represented as ET50) following the reaction sequence: Serum #5 > #2 >Taken together, RBD, S1 and S proteins from insect cells maintain the native-likeSARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Among these epitopes, most RBD epitopes are strictlytertiary conformation-dependent sites that are damaged upon the mild denaturedcondition of reductant and SDS treatment, NTD within S1 bears some linear epitopes,whereas S2 part essentially has linear epitopes that are immunogenic in all COVID-19patients (n=6).To examine the structure of the trimeric S ectodomain with native sequence, weprepared cryo-EM grids using the Ni-NTA purified S proteins and collected 1,513electron micrograph movies. We then recruited the recently reported cryo-EM map of S prefusiontrimer (EMD-21374, at resolution of 3.17 \u00c5, low pass to 5.43 \u00c5 prior to structuralcomparison) and compared our cryo-EM map at same resolution (Fig. The structural comparison demonstrated that the S-pretrimer retains a unique conformation different from the prefusion conformation of thetwo reported SARS-CoV-2 spike structures (PDB codes 6VSB and 6VXX).237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251252253254255256257We then compared the conformation of our S-pre structure with that of 21deposited coronavirus S models.

Although the biology and virology of SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive,in terms of knowledge on other coronaviruses, the spikes decorating the SARS-CoV-2virion play a critical role in viral attachment and entry to host cells. In this study, we suggest that theSARSCoV-2 spike may retain at more precedent state than the classic prefusion conformationthat has been determined for other coronaviruses. Various versions of S proteins are the major targets for vaccine immunogen candidate.
