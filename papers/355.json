The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Methods Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported data from National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared. Findings In our baseline scenario, the government has taken strict prevention actions, and the estimate numbers fit the official numbers very well. Simulation results tells that, if the prevention measures are relaxed or the action starting date of prevention measures is later than Jan. 23, 2020, the peak of identified individuals would be greatly increased, and the elimination date also would be delayed. We estimate the reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2.7. And simulation of the baseline scenario tells that, the peak infected individuals will be 49093 at Feb.16, 2020 and the epidemic spreading will be eliminated at the end of March 2020. The simulation results also tell that the quarantine rate and the starting date of intervention action policy have great effect on the epidemic spreading. Specifically, if the quarantine rate is reduced from 100% to less than 63%, which is the threshold of the quarantine rate to control the epidemic", "text": "spreading, the epidemic spreading would never be eliminated out. And, if the starting date of interventionis delayed for 1 day than the date Jan. 23, the peak infected population will increase about 6351 individuals.If the delayed period is 3 days or 7 days, the increasing number would be 21621 or 65929 individuals, thusthe peak infected number would up to 70714 and 115022 individuals.Given that 2019-nCoV could be controlled under the strong prevention measures of what China has takenand it will take about three months. The confirmed infected individuals will still keep quick increasing fora generation period (27 days, equal to the sum of exposed period and identified period) after the start timepoint of control. The strong prevention measures should be insisted until the epidemics is wiped out. Otherdomestic places and overseas have confirmed infected individuals should take strong interventionsimmediately. Generally, earlier strong prevention measures could efficiently mitigate the outbreaks in othercities all over the world has confirmed individuals of epidemic of 2019-nCoV.        In December 2019, atypical pneumonia caused by the zoonotic 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)was first reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China. The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is fast spreading,now to over 20 countries. In Jan.25, 2020, human-to-human transmission is confirmed[        To mitigate the spread of the virus, Chinese Government has implemented extremely serious quarantineprevention measures since Jan 23, 2020. All 31 provincial-level regions in China announced the highestpublic health alert. The extremely serious prevention measures are taken to mitigate the epidemicspreading, such as: Group tours, travel packages are suspended across China; Mass gatherings are allcancelled; Spring Festival holiday is extended; the start of Spring semester is postponed; Mask wearing isrequired at public place; temperature screening measures to detect individuals with fever have adopted atairports, train stations and Highway entrance, as well as entrance of community.        Until now, we still know little about the infectiousness of 2019-nCoV. The most worrisome aspect is theinfectiousness of incubation (or exposed) individuals. That means, the incubation individual is beinginfected and maybe has the ability of infectiousness but without symptom. However, the existingforecasting model, Susceptible-Exposed-Identified-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposedindividual is being infected but without infectiousness. And other forecasting model, such asSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, even doesn\u2019t consider the exposed process. So, maybetraditional transmission models of epidemic spreading are not suit for 2019-nCoV. That is a possible keyreason for why the estimating infected population based on SEIR model are too far more than the officialnumber. The estimate number is 75815 individuals in Jan. 25 2020 [        In this study, we provide a new Exposed-Identified-Recovered (EIR) model integrate the epidemicspreading processes before and after the prevention measures. And we supposed that the spreading processare mainly depended on the exposed process. On the contrary, as the identified individual generally will bequarantined by the hospital and can\u2019t spread any more. Then, we nowcast the probable peak size of theepidemic and the possible duration of epidemic spreading, first by assuming the initial phase are freelyspread by the exposed individuals, then the contact with the exposed individual are blocked under strictintervention measures that have been implemented from Jan.23, 2020. More importantly, from a publicconcern viewpoint, we simulate the possible future trend of the epidemic spreading under differentquarantine rate and quarantine starting date.This article was intended to simulate the epidemic spreading trend under the first situation of freepropagation and then under the intervention measures. We first constructed a new transmission model ofepidemic spreading based on the system dynamics and SEIR model. Then we estimate the modelparameters and the basic reproductive number of 2019-nCoV, on the basis of the latest official confirmedinfected data in the mainland China. We then forecast the peak number of outbreak size and the duration ofepidemic spreading under the extremely serious prevention measures. Finally, we simulate possiblespreading course of 2019-nCoV under different quarantine rate and starting date of prevention measures inmainland China.        Much is unknown about how 2019-nCoV spreads. Most often, spread from person-to-personhappens among close contacts (about 6 feet). There have been reports external icon of spread from aninfected patient with no symptoms to a close contact[        SEIR model has been widely used for modeling infectious diseases. However, it not suitable for theabove spreading characters of the 2019-nCoV. We adjust this model and constructed EIR model. In which,the total population into three states: exposed (E, being infected as incubation with no symptom but withinfectiousness), identified (I, being identified and quarantined without spread ability) and recovered (R,including death). In our model, exposed is assumed to be the first stage of infected individual, which issame as incubation stage, has no symptom and with infectiousness. So, we assume the exposedindividuals has the possibility of infectiousness. And identified is assumed to be the second stage ofinfected individual, has symptom and be confirmed by hospital. So, we assume the identified individualhas no ability of spreading since she/he will be pharmaceutical quarantined.Furthermore, as differential equations are not suitable for the dynamic lag relationships between exposedindividuals, identified individuals and recovered individual, the new recursive formulations are presented.The dynamical process of EIR thus could be described as:dE (t ) \u239b 1\u239e= \u239c kb \u2212 \u239f E (t )dt \u239d TE\u23a0\u0394I (t ) = E (t \u2212 TE )TE + TI \u2265 t \u2265 TE + 1\u0394I (t ) = E (t \u2212 TE ) \u2212 E (t \u2212 TE \u2212 TI )t > TE + TI\u0394R (t ) = I (t \u2212 TI )t \u2265 TE + TI(4)where E(t), I(t) and R(t) respectively represent the number of individuals in the exposed, identified andrecovered states at date t (in days in later analyses). TE and TI were the mean exposed period (assumed tobe the same as incubation) and treatment period; b is the risk of transmission per contact, k is the averagecontact by a person. Formulation (1) means a normal individual would turn to be an exposed individualwith probability if she/he contacts with an infected individual; Formulation (2) and Formulation (3) meansthat, after each exposed period, an incubation individual would turn to be an identified individual.Formulation (4) means after each treatment period, an infected individual would be recovered or dead. TheEIR epidemic spreading model is illustrated by figure 1.From the dynamic formulations, we could easily deduce the formulations of the cumulated identifiednumber, which are showed as formulation (5) and (6). The former is the first phase of cumulated before thegeneration period, which equal to the sum of exposed period and treatment period. The latter is the secondphase of cumulated identified population after the generation period.(1)(2)(3)I (t ) = \u2211 E (k ) = t\u2211\u2212TE e\u03b2 ' (k\u22121)t\u2212TEk =1k=1TE + TI \u2265 t \u2265 TE + 1t > TE + TITE TIFigure 1: EIR epidemic spreading model(5)(6)        Early predictions for incubation time are between 2 and 14 days, based on data from similarcoronaviruses, with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days[                In the new publications of Li Qun et al. (2020) [        According to the official report data, the increased confirmed individuals are 259 in Jan 23th 2020 andthe cured and discharged individuals are 261 in Feb 5th 2020. Thus, we assume the infectious period is 13days, TI=13.From Jan 20th 2020, the daily routine notification of infectious diseases is available on the website ofNational Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The main data is reported in Table 1.Table 1 Official data of epidemic diseaseconfirmedconfirmedDeadt66676869707172737475767778798081828384dateWe assume the first infected incubation individual was on Nov. 17 2019, then Nov. 17 2019 is the firstday of our simulations. So, t=1 corresponding to Nov. 17 2019. We assume average contact per personbefore strict prevention measures is 5 per day, that is k=5. From Jan. 23, 2020, corresponding to t=69, theextremely prevention measures have been taken, then the average contact person of exposed individualsare blocked, and has k=0. That is, when t>69, k=0.According to the data source descripted above, we have TE=14, TI=13, k=5. Then, we can set parameterb for the EIR model to fit the most recent official cumulated data. Using the latest cumulated confirmednumber 31161 Feb.6th 2020 (t=83), we estimate the parameter b=0.038678. Hence, the basic reproductionnumber R0 = k*b*TE=2.7. And the transmission rate without prevention measures is \u03b2=k*b= 0.1934.Most Chinese people were aware of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV by the mainstream media after 20January 2020. The Hubei government released the announcement about strengthening the prevention andcontrol measures against 2019-nCoV, and launched the second-level public health emergency response at2:40am on 22 January, 2020. Thus, the public awareness and effective interventions were absent when thetime was prior to this point. Then, Wuhan city limited inflow and outflow of people on January 23, 2020\uff0cwhich was the key measures to prevent and control the outbreak. From then on, more and more strongmeasures are taken to reduce the transmission of the epidemic.As governments will take strict quarantine measures to prevent the pandemic of the new virus, we willmodel the policy results. We have different scenarios. Base Scenario: The government takes strict casesthat all people who are found infected are strictly quarantined (k=0). Other Scenarios: The governmenttakes strict cases that infected people are less strictly quarantined. These different scenarios correspondingto the ranges of k between 0 and 5 (see in table 2). k=0 indicates most strictly prevention measures aretaken and quarantined rate is 100%. On the contrary, k= 5 means no prevention measure is taken andquarantined rate is 0%. Table 2 illustrates the relationship between quarantined rate and contact number k.We expect that the epidemic of Corona virus in China will exist until May 2020. So, we set thesimulation period is from Dec. 1, 2019 (t=1) to Apr. 30, 2020 (t=167). The baseline scenario is withquarantine rate 100% and action starting date Jan. 23, 2020 (t=69). Given different quarantine rates andaction starting date, the main results are reported as follows.Figure 2 showed the results of when quarantined rate is zero, that is k=5, which also could be taken asthe scenario of no prevention measures are taken all the way. In this scenario, the number of the exposedindividuals and identified individuals are presented as Exponential growth. At the end of April, there wouldbe 740508835 individuals identified.(t=167) and the trajectory of official data from Jan. 23, 2020 (t=66) to Feb. 7, 2020 (t=84). In figure 3, thegreen solid line is the trajectory of official data from Jan. 23, 2020 (t=66) to Feb. 7, 2020 (t=84), the reddashed line is the simulated curve of identified individuals. The second half of the trajectory of officialdata are well fitted by the simulation of the baseline scenario. From the simulation of baseline scenario, theestimation of the first half of the epidemic spreading from Jan. 20 (t=66) to Feb.7 (t=84) is higher than theofficial data. This could be explained by that, at the first stage, as the absence of the knowledge of thenovel virus, the diagnoses are impossible to identify all the exposed individuals in time. So, it is naturallythe confirmed number would be less than the actual exposed individuals at the beginning period ofepidemic spreading.Compared to the action start date Jan. 23rd 2020, if the action starting date is taken earlier or delayed 1day, 3 days or 7 days, figure 5 and table 4 shows the simulation results. Compare to the baseline actiondate, Jan. 23, 2022, one day ahead would reduce 5622 identified individuals and one day delay wouldincrease 6351 identified individuals. If the action starting days are delayed for 3 days or 7 days, theincreasing identified individuals would up to 21621 and 65929, which means the peak number of identifiedindividuals would be up to 70714 and 115022.        Since Jan 23rd 2020, after outbreak of the novel atypical pneumonia, government has applied substantialdraconian intervention measures to drastically reduce within-population contact rates. These measuresinclude extending the Spring Festival holiday, and instituting work-from-home arrangements, postpone thestart of Spring semester, Nurseries and early learning centers closures, cancellation of mass gatherings,wearing masks at public palce, and so on. However, the reported case numbers are still rising rapidly.Simulating the epidemic spreading trend of 2019-nCoV under the control measures are of crucialimportance for public health planning and control domestically and internationally. Several earlierpublications have given some useful forecasting of 2019-nCoV [        In this study, we have constructed a novel EIR transmission model to stimulate the epidemic spreading.On the trajectory of simulating curve of baseline scenario, the peak number of infected population of2019-nCoV will be 49093 on Feb 16, and it could be securely contained the spread of infection under thecurrent draconian intervention measures. However, these intervention measures should be kept for about 2months until the end of April. And extremely draconian level prevention measures should be kept at leastan incubation period after the infected population peak. In the baseline scenario, the government takes thestrict prevention actions, the estimate numbers fit the official numbers very well. There can be nodoubt that the official numbers are accurate.Simulating result also tells that the quarantined rate, which present the degree of the preventionmeasures, has great effect on the peak number and duration of the epidemic spreading. Only thequarantined rate is higher than 80%, the epidemic spreading could be reduced drastically and the identifiedpopulation would be less than 5000 in the end of March 2020. Even at the threshold degree, when thequarantined rate is 63%, the infected population would up to a peak number 115022 and keep at thatnumber for ever unless more strict prevention measures are taken. If the quarantined rate is less than 63%the epidemic spreading of 2019-nCoV will never be eliminated and the infected population would stillkeep increasing.The simulation results of different action starting date support the common sense that the control actionshould be taken as early as possible. Specifically, simulation results tells that the action starting date ofprevention measures later than Jan. 23, 2020, the peak of identified individuals would be greatly increased.And the wipe out date also would be delayed.The modelling techniques that we used in this study are based on SEIR and system dynamics. And ourmodel is parameterized with the latest official released data of 2019-nCoV. An additional strength of ourstudy is that simulation of the baseline scenario is well fit the trajectory of the official data of epidemicspreading. Nonetheless, our study has several major limitations. First, we assumed that the transmission of2019-nCoV mainly caused by exposed individuals (without symptoms) and the transmission ability ofidentified (without symptoms) is ignored. Second, our transmission model was somewhat sensitive toseveral key parameters: the starting date of epidemic spreading, the exposed (incubation) period and theidentified (treatment) period. And our assumption regarding the exposed (incubation) period and theidentified (treatment) period is keeping stable. If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality inits transmission, our epidemic forecast might not be reliable.Huili Yan designed the experiments and collected data.
