Key aspects of this case includedthe decision made by the patient to seek medicalattention after reading public health warningsabout the outbreak; recognition of the patient\u2019srecent travel history to Wuhan by local providers,with subsequent coordination among local, state,and federal public health officials; andidentification of possible 2019-nCoV infection, whichallowed for prompt isolation of the patient andsubsequent laboratory confirmation of 2019-nCoV, aswell as for admission of the patient for furtherevaluation and management. This case reporthighlights the importance of clinicians elicitinga recent history of travel or exposure to sickcontacts in any patient presenting for medical carewith acute illness symptoms, in order to ensureappropriate identification and prompt isolationof patients who may be at risk for 2019-nCoVinfection and to help reduce furthertransmission. Finally, this report highlights the need todetermine the full spectrum and natural historyof clinical disease, pathogenesis, and duration ofviral shedding associated with 2019-nCoVinfection to inform clinical management and publichealth decision making.The findings and conclusions in this report are those of theauthors and do not necessarily represent the official position ofthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available withthe full text of this article at NEJM.org.We thank the patient; the nurses and clinical staff who areproviding care for the patient; staff at the local and state healthdepartments; staff at the Washington State Department ofHealth Public Health Laboratories and at the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Viral DiseaseLaboratory; CDC staff at the Emergency Operations Center; andmembers of the 2019-nCoV response teams at the local, state,and national levels.nejm.org", "ref_list": [[], ["Pneumo- vention.
