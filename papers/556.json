China hasbuilt several new hospitals in an attempt to manage the infected individuals [7]. It isimperative that we evaluate novel models in an attempt to control the rapidlyspreading virus [8].In order to reduce the time to identification of a person under investigation (PUI) forthe COVID-19 infection, and the rapid isolation of this individual, we propose tocollect the basic travel history along with the more common manifestations using aphone-based online survey. Such collected data can be used to assist in thepreliminary screening and early identification of possible COVID-19 infectedindividuals. Thousands of data points are able to be collected and processedthrough an artificial intelligence (AI) framework which can ultimately evaluateindividuals that may be infected and stratify them into no-risk, minimal-risk,moderate-risk, and high-risk of being infected with the virus. The identification of thehigh-risk cases can then be quarantined earlier, thus decreasing the chance ofspread.See Appendix I for the details on the steps involved in data collection on allthe respondents independent of whether or not they think they are infected. The AIalgorithm described in Appendix II is to identify possible case identifications andsend alerts to the nearest health clinic as well as to the respondent for an immediatehealth visit, we call this as an \u201calert for health check recommendation forCOVID2019. In case the respondent is unable to commute to the health center, the healthdepartment can then send an alert to a mobile health unit so they can then dodoorto-door assessments and even testing for the virus. This generates alert for mobilehealth check recommendation for 2019-nCoV (MHCRC). If a respondent does nothave an immediate risk of having symptoms or signs related to the viral infection,then the AI-based health alert will be sent to the respondent to notify them that thereis no current risk of COVID-2019. Figure 1 summarizes the outcomes of datacollection and identification of possible cases.The data recorded in step 5 of the algorithm using signs and symptoms will becollected prior to both the groups who have received alerts HCRC or MHCRC (forpossible identification and assessment) and NCRC (for non-identified respondents).These are explained in steps (iii) and (iv) in the Appendix II. The extended analysisproposed will help to understand if there is any association with differentsociodemographic variables and the manifestations such as fever and signs and lowerrespiratory infections, including cough and SOB in individuals defined as either withand without possible infection.Applications of AI and deep learning argued to be useful tools in assistingdiagnosis and treatment decision making [10-11]. There were studies whichpromoted disease detection through AI models [12-15]. Use of mobile phones[1619] and web based portals [20-21] have been tested successfully in health relateddata collection. However, one need to apply such techniques in a timely way forfaster results. Apart from cost-effectiveness, the proposed modeling will be of greatassistance in identifying and controlling when populations are closed due to virusspread. In addition to these, our proposed algorithm can be easily extended toidentify individuals who might have any mild symptoms and signs.Acknowledgements: We thank Professor N.V.

Bull World HealthOrgan 90: 604\u2013612.Appendix I: Steps involved in data collection through mobile phonesWe have developed our data collection criteria based on CDC\u2019s Flowchart to Identifyand Assess 2019 Novel Coronavirus [9] and added additional variables for theextended utility of our efforts in identifying infected and controlling the spread (seeTable 1).Let be the outputs recorded during the data collection steps 1through 5 described in the Appendix I. There are three outputs within which aregiven asand nine pairs of outputs withinwhich are given aswhere the pairpresence or absence ofsign and symptom(i) If the set of identifiers, , forforrepresents the respondents response onsign and symptom and duration of correspondingis equal to one of the elements of the set , forfor a respondent, then, send HCRC or MHCRC. If is not equal to any of theelements of the set then proceed to test criteria (iii).(ii) If the set of identifiers, , foris equal to one of the elements of the set then send HCRC or MHCRC to thatrespondent, else proceed to the test criteria (iv).(iii)then the respondent will be sent an NCRC alert.(iv)If is equal to one of the elements of the set , then the respondent will be sent anNCRC alert.Comparison of test criteria results of (iii) and (iv) with their corresponding geographicand socio-demographic details will yield further investigations of signs and symptomsbased on whether or not an individual in the survey has traveled to coronavirusaffected areas or had contact with any person who is known to have COVID-19. Aswe are focusing, in this note, only identification of cases, further analysis techniquesare out of the scope. However, our approach is flexible to capture various otherassociations within the populations.Appendix III: Further computations on the data collectedSuppose and are individuals in a region who have responded and notresponded, respectively for a mobile-based online survey. Responses are randomlyassociated and not depended on the sickness due to the virus. The pairgives us the proportions who have responded and not responded in that region. Notethat we can compute because the value is known to us in that region. Letout of are possible cases identified through our algorithm and out of arepossible cases of the virus which were never identified by the algorithm (becausenumber of individuals never responded to the survey). Since andus, one of the following relations will hold:are known toWe will know which one of the relations listed in (A2.1) is true. Whenthe following relations will hold:, one ofBut we will never know which one of the relations in (A2.1) is true because werenever identified by the algorithm. For example, suppose 2000 individuals respondand 500 individuals do not respond to the survey, and 400 were identified as apossible number of cases by the algorithm. If there are 100 possible cases of virus(which we do not have a mechanism to count) out of 500 who never responded, thenthe relationis true. Similarly, we will see other relations of (A2.2) could arise when Usinga similar argument, we can verify that when other relations of (A2.1) are true, we stillbe unsure which of the relations in (A2.1) is true. The contingency options areprovided in Figure 2 to visualize the data to be generated through the proposedmethod.Theorem: Let there be individuals in a region. The probability that casesidentified through the AI framework given that there are individuals responded tothe survey isProof:Let , and letbe the collection of individuals responded,be the collection of individuals not responded. Supposebe the collection of respondents who are identified as possible cases.
