Title/abstract and full-text screening,data abstraction, and risk of bias appraisal were carried out by single reviewers.Results: 54 studies were included in the review: three controlled trials, 10 cohort studies, sevenretrospective medical record/database studies, and 34 case reports or series. These studiesincluded patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs, n=33), middle east respiratorysyndrome (MERS, n=16), COVID-19 (n=3), and unspecified coronavirus (n=2). The mostcommon treatment was ribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination oflopinavir/ritonavir (n=7). Additional therapies included broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30),steroids (n=39) or various interferons (n=12). No eligible studies examining monoclonalantibodies for COVID-19 were identified. One trial found that ribavirin prophylactic treatmentstatistically significantly reduced risk of MERS infection in people who had been exposed to thevirus. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERSpatients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies.Of the 40 studies reporting mortality rates in hospitalized SARS or MERS patients, one cohortstudy (MERS) and one retrospective study (SARS) found a statistically significant increase inthe mortality rate for patients treated with ribavirin. Eighteen studies reported potentialdrugrelated adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function inpatients receiving ribavirin.Conclusion: The current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of antiviral therapies forcoronavirus is inconclusive and suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials orobservational studies, preventing any treatment recommendations from being made. However,it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41/54 studies),which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverseevents so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy.Overall methods ..................................................................................................................... 5Literature search .................................................................................................................... 5Eligibility criteria...................................................................................................................... 6Study selection ....................................................................................................................... 8Data items and data abstraction ............................................................................................. 8Risk of bias appraisal ............................................................................................................. 9Characteristics of included studies ........................................................................................10Risk of Bias Results...............................................................................................................12Studies of COVID-19 .............................................................................................................13Ongoing human trials for COVID-19...................................................................................14Infection Prevention ...........................................................................................................14ICU Admission ...................................................................................................................15Mortality .............................................................................................................................15APPENDIX 4 \u2013 Detailed Table of Interventions and Outcomes .................................................40APPENDIX 5 \u2013 Quality Appraisal/Risk of Bias \u2013 Complete Results...........................................61The Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch of the Public Health Agency of Canada(PHAC) submitted a query on the effectiveness and safety of antiviral, antibody, or othermedical countermeasures for the treatment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) through theCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN).They requested the DSEN Methods and Application Group in Indirect Comparisons (MAGIC)Team conduct a rapid review on this topic with an approximate 2-week timeline.The overall objective of this rapid review was to identify safe and effective medicalcountermeasures to address the current outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In orderto focus the research question to increase feasibility, we proposed the following key researchquestions:1. What is the effectiveness and safety of any antiviral and/or monoclonal antibodytreatment currently available to treat (COVID-19)?2. What is the effectiveness and safety of currently available antiviral therapies used totreat other coronavirus infections?The rapid review conduct was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews ofInterventions1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research2.The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach, with consultation from theknowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada at the following stages: questiondevelopment, literature search, study inclusion, interpretation of results, and draft report. Afterthe report is submitted to the Public Health Agency of Canada, a manuscript will be prepared forpublication and we will invite our knowledge users to join us as coauthors. We will use thePreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement3 toguide the reporting of our rapid review results; a PRISMA extension specific to rapid reviews iscurrently under development.Comprehensive literature searches addressing both research question 1 (RQ1) and researchquestion 2 (RQ2) were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, theCochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org databases. Grey (i.e., difficult to locate orunpublished) literature was located using keyword searches of relevant terms (e.g. coronavirus,SARS, etc.) in clinicaltrials.gov and GIDEON (Global Infectious Diseases and EpidemiologyNetwork). Additionally, the final set of included articles was cross-referenced with a list studiesprovided by our knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Health as part of the scopingprocess for this review. The full MEDLINE search strategy and grey literature search keywordscan be found in Appendix 1.The Eligibility criteria followed the PICOST framework and consisted of:Population (for research question 1 (RQ1) and 2 (RQ2): Individuals of any age treated for acoronavirus infection. Subgroups of interest include older adults aged >65 years, pediatric,pregnant, or immunocompromised patients.The following interventions were eligible for RQ1:Antiviral medications approved for use in COVID-19 or currently in pre-clinical trials(animal studies, excluding in vitro studies) for treating COVID-19 (see Table 1).Monoclonal antibodies approved for use in COVID-19 or currently in pre-clinical trials(animal studies, excluding in vitro studies) for treating COVID-19.The following interventions were of interest for RQ2:Antiviral agents used alone or in combination that are approved for use incoronavirus treatment or are being examined in clinical trials for use in coronavirustreatment (Table 1).Comparator (for RQ1 and RQ2): One of the interventions listed above, no intervention, orplacebo.Outcomes (for RQ1 and RQ2): lab-confirmed coronavirus infection, hospitalization, intensivecare unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and adverse events (e.g., exacerbation of infection).syncytial virusinfectionsribavirin (Ibavyr) and antibodiesprotease inhibitorso bocepreviro telapreviro lopinaviro ritonaviro darunavir/cobicistat(Prezcobix)o indinavir (Crixivan)o saquinavir (Invirase)integrase inhibitorso raltegraviro elvitegraviro dolutegravirentry (fusion) inhibitorso maraviroco celsentrinucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitorso abacaviro ziageno emtricitabineo emtrivao lamivudineinterferon 1\u03b2 (Betaseron/Extavia)modulatorsAntibodies\uf0b7 abciximab (Reopro)\uf0b7 adalimumab (Humira/Amjevita)\uf0b7 alefacept (Amevive)\uf0b7 alemtuzumab (Campath)\uf0b7 basiliximab (Simulect)\uf0b7 belimumab (Benlysta)\uf0b7 bezlotoxumab (Zinplava)\uf0b7 canakinumab (Ilaris)\uf0b7 certolizumab (Cimzia)\uf0b7 cetuximab (Erbitux)\uf0b7 daclizumab (Zenapax/Zinbryta)\uf0b7 denosumab (Prolia/Xgeva)\uf0b7 efalizumab (Raptiva)\uf0b7 golimumab (Simponi)\uf0b7 inflectra (Remicade)*Note: not an exhaustive list\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7\uf0b7o epiviro tenofoviro vireado zidovudineo azidothymidineo retrovirnonnucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitorso doravirineo pifeltroo efavirenzo sustivao etravirineo intelenceo nevirapineo viramuneo rilpivirineo edurantacyclic nucleosidephosphonate analogueso cidofoviro diphosphatesipilimumab (Yervoy)ixekizumab (Taltz)natalizumab (Tysabri)nivolumab (Opdivo)olaratumab (Lartruvo)omalizumab (Xolair)palivizumab (Synagis)panitumumab (Vectibix)pembrolizumab (Keytruda)rituximab (Rituxan)tocilizumab (Actemra)trastuzumab (Herceptin)secukinumab (Cosentyx)ustekinumab (Stelara)Study designs:\uf0b7The following study designs were eligible for RQ1:ooooooooRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTsNon-randomized studies (e.g., non-randomized trials, interrupted time series,controlled before after)Observational studies (e.g., cohort, case control, cross-sectional)Case studies, case reports, and case seriesPre-clinical (animal) studies\uf0b7The following study designs were eligible for RQ2:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTsNon-randomized studies (e.g., quasi-RCTs, non-randomized trials, interrupted timeseries, controlled before after)Observational studies (e.g., cohort, case control, cross-sectional)Time periods (for RQ1 and RQ2): All periods of time and duration of follow-up were eligible.Other (for RQ1 and RQ2): Only studies published in English were eligible for inclusion, due tothe short timelines for this review. Relevant studies written in languages other than English andrelevant studies of an ineligible design (e.g., trial protocol, literature review) will be excluded butreported in an appendix of possibly relevant articles (Appendix 2).For both level 1 (title/abstract) and level 2 (full-text) screening, a screening form was preparedbased on the eligibility criteria and pilot-tested by the review team using 25 citations prior tolevel 1 screening and 10 full text articles prior to level 2 screening. Agreement betweenreviewers was sufficiently high (>75%) in both cases so no further pilot-testing was required.Full screening was completed by a single reviewer for both level 1 and level 2 usingSynthesi.SR, the team\u2019s proprietary online software [https://breakthroughkt.ca/login.php].Items for data abstraction included study characteristics (e.g., study period, study design,country of conduct), patient characteristics (e.g., mean age, age range, co-morbidities),intervention details (e.g., type of intervention, dose, timing of treatment), comparator details(e.g., comparator intervention, dose), and outcome results (e.g., hospitalizations due tocoronavirus, adverse events, mortality) at the longest duration of follow-up.A standardized data abstraction form was developed to capture data on the above listed items.Prior to data abstraction, a calibration exercise was completed to test the form amongst theentire review team using two randomly selected full-text articles. Following successfulcompletion of the calibration exercise, included studies were abstracted by single reviewers.Risk of bias appraisal was carried out by single reviewers using Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB)tool4 for controlled trials and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale5 (NOS) for cohort or case-controlstudies.Included studies were synthesized descriptively including summary statistics and detailed tablesof study characteristics and results. Tables of study results are organized according to studydesign and where available, information on relevant subgroups were highlighted.The database search returned a total of 4,491 citations, while the grey literature searchesreturned 305 citations, and 8 additional citations were identified from the articles provided by ourknowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada for level 1 screening. A total of4,567 citations were excluded after level 1 screening and a further 81 citations were identifiedas ineligible for the current review but potentially of interest to knowledge users, leaving 156potentially relevant articles to be passed to level 2 screening. The full-text for 29 articles couldnot be obtained in time to be screened for this review and were added to the inventory ofpotentially relevant articles. Of the 127 articles screened at level 2, 74 were passed to dataabstraction. During data abstraction a further 20 articles were excluded due to lack of relevantoutcomes, leaving 54 articles included in this review (Figure 1).Studies included in the rapid review(n = 54)Citations excluded(n = 4,677)Full-text articles excluded(n = 53)Ineligible population (n=22)Ineligible intervention (n=12)Ineligible study design (n=10)Potentially relevant but ineligible(n=9)Full-text articles excluded(n = 20)Companion report/duplicate data(n=8)No relevant outcome data (n=12)Of the 54 studies included in this review three were controlled trials6-8, 10 were cohortstudies918, seven were retrospective medical record/database studies19-25, and 34 were case reports orcase series26-59 (Table 2). All of the included studies were published between 2003 and 2020with the majority conducted in Hong Kong (n=14), followed by China (n=12), Saudi Arabia(n=10), Canada (n=5), South Korea (n=4), Taiwan (n=3), and one each from France, Germany,Greece, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Sample sizes for the studies rangedfrom single patients in the case reports to groups of >1000 patients in the cohort studies.Overall, the majority of studies (n=33) dealt with treatment of Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome (SARS), followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; n=16), COVID-19(n=3) and two studies treated unspecified coronavirus.The majority of studies were conducted in adult populations (n=52), one case report31 and onecase series36 included infant and pediatric populations, respectively. Four casereports/series29,45,46,48 specifically included immunocompromised patients and one case study34included a pregnant woman with MERS; however, the majority of study populations includedpatients with comorbid conditions (n=33). Common comorbidities included diabetes, heartdisease, hypertension, and renal failure (Appendix 3). The most common antiviral studied wasribavirin (n=41), followed by oseltamivir (n=10) and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (n=7).Additional therapies used in the studies included a variety of broad spectrum antibiotics (n=30),steroids including hyrdcortisone, methylprednisone, or prednisolone (n=39) or variousinterferons (n=12; Appendix 3). No animal or human trials investigating monoclonal antibodiesfor the treatment of COVID-19 were found in this rapid review. All of the studies recruited fromor reported on hospitalized populations and the most commonly reported outcome was mortality(n=40), followed by ICU admission (n=21) and adverse events (n=18).FoscarnetRemdesivirAntibioticsSteroidsInterferons--221--3103--3521122226The 34 case reports/series and 7 retrospective studies included in this review were notassessed for risk of bias due to the inherent bias in the type of study design. The 3 trials wereassessed with the Cochrane RoB tool4 and the 10 cohort studies were assessed using theNOS5. The risk of bias in the 3 included trials was overall difficult to judge due to a lack ofadequate descriptions of study methods (Figure 2). All three of the trials were at high or unclearrisk of bias on the following components: random sequence generation, allocation concealment,and blinding of participants/personnel (Appendix 5). The cohort studies were of fair qualityoverall; most of the studies suffered from a lack of representative sampling (n=8), failed todemonstrate that the outcomes of interest were not present at the start of the study (n=8), orfailed to adequately ensure the comparability of cohorts (n=4; Figure 3). The complete NOSresults are provided in Appendix 5.ABCDThree studies examining patients infected with COVID-19 were included in this review: one casereport35 and two case series56,57.The case report35 included a 35-year-year old man, the first American diagnosed withCOVID19. He, he was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime which are standard treatments forsuspected community-acquired pneumonia. Upon lab-confirmation of COVID-19 infection, theantibiotics were stopped and the patient was started on Remdesivir 7 days after initial admissionto hospital. At study end, the patient remained hospitalized with the majority of symptomsresolved (see appendices 3 and 4 for complete details).The two case series56,57 were conducted in China and included 4 and 138 patients, respectively.All patients were hospitalized and initial diagnosis was made based on WHO Criteria laterconfirmed by lab-testing of the patient specimens. The case series included an approximatelyeven number of male and female (55% v 45%) patients ranging in age from 19 to 68 years old,with a variety of co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney or liverdisease, COPD, and diabetes (Appendix 3). In one case series57, patients (n=4) were treatedwith a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, Arbidol (umifenovir), antibiotics, Shufeng Jiedu Capsule(Traditional Chinese Medicine), and intravenous immunoglobulins (Appendix 4). At study end(15 days),) two patients tested negative for COVID-19 and were subsequently discharged fromthe hospital and two patients remained hospitalized, one of whom still required mechanicalventilation (Appendix 4). In the larger case series56, 124 patients were treated with oseltamivircombined with antibiotic therapy in 89 patients and combined with glucocorticoids in 62 patients(Appendix 4). Over the course of the study, 34 patients treated with oseltamivir were admitted tothe ICU, 17 of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. At study end (19 days),) 47patients had been discharged and 6 patients died, all of whom had been admitted to ICU(Appendix 4).Four currently ongoing randomized controlled trials proposing to test treatments for COVID-19were identified through keyword searches of clinicaltrials.gov. All four trials are being carried outin China, three are investigating antiviral medications (lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol (umifenovir),darunavir, cobicstat, and, ASC09/ritonavir) and one trial is investigating a combination oflopinavir/ritonavir with Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM). At the time of this writing two of thetrials have started recruiting patients (further details in Table 3).LNCihC,iT2n00a240252885 J1Ru2el5cyrp3ua1itr,itni2cg0ip2a0nts AGGGdrrrooouuuultppp(1BAC8;::-sss8ttt0aaannnydddrsaaa)rrr;dddlatttrrbreee-aacaotttmmmnfeeeirnnnmttt e++dlaoirnpbfiiendcaotvlioi(run/rmitoifneanvoivrir)LNCuhC,iTn20a0422052274 3DN0eotcpeyaemrttibcreeiprcar3un1tits,in2g020 tIACrnelotleamartgvmpeeaesnrn;atitoNtsonar::tiDConaoarnulvnHeanevtaiirol,tnhCaColtobrmiecaimstmtiastes+niotnscodniavegnntoiosnticalcriteriaQiu, 2020 Not yet recruiting Adult (18-75 yrs); lab-confirmed infectionChina 160 participants Intervention: ASC09/ritonavir + conventional treatmentNCT04261907 June 30, 2020 Comparator: lopinavir/ritonavir + conventional treatmentXiao, 2020 Recruiting Youth/Adult (14-80 yrs); lab-confirmed infectionChina 150 participants Intervention: TCM + conventional medicines**NCT04251871 January 22, 2021 Comparator: Conventional medicines****Conventional medicines includes: oxygen therapy, antiviral therapy (alfa interferon via aerosolinhalation, and lopinavir/ritonavir, 400mg/100mg, p.o, bid)One of the included trials7 examined the effectiveness of ribavirin combined withlopinavir/ritonavir compared to no treatment as a prophylactic measure for healthcare workershighly exposed to MERS through unprotected exposure to a patient with pneumonia laterconfirmed to be caused by MERS-CoV. None of the subjects in the prophylaxis arm(ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir) developed MERS while 6 subjects in the control arm were infectedwith MERS as confirmed by rPT-PCR testing. The risk of infection was statistically significantlylower in the prophylaxis arm (adjusted odds ratio: 0.405, 95% CI 0.274 to 0.599, p=0.009;Appendix 4).Of the 21 studies reporting this outcome, one was a randomized trial6 comparing ribavirinsupplemented with hydrocortisone to ribavirin alone; three were cohort studies14,15,17 comparingoseltamivir to steroid treatment alone, ribavirin with continuous steroid treatment to ribavirin withhigh-dose \u2018pulse\u2019 steroids, and ribavirin to steroid and/or antibiotic treatment; three wereretrospective studies19,20,25 examining the effectiveness of ribavirin and oseltamivir alone or incombination with other drugs; and 14 were case reports/series33,34,37,40,42,44,45,47,50,51,53,55-57examining ribavirin, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with steroids orantibiotics. None of the trials, cohorts, or retrospective studies demonstrated statisticallysignificant results between any of the comparisons (i.e., in favour of or against the effectivenessof ribavirin, oseltamivir or lopinavir/ritonavir) in reducing the risk of ICU admission for patientswith SARS or MERS. The case reports and series were similarly inconclusive, none of the studyauthors reported a particular advantage for patients with COVID-19, SARS, or MERS treatedwith ribavirin, oseltamivir, or lopinavir/ritonavir.Special populationsOne case series45 included 4 patients with hematological malignancies that acquired MERSinfections. The patients were all treated with oseltamivir and one patient required admission tothe ICU due to worsening symptoms. One case report34 of a pregnant woman with MERSdescribed initially attempting treatment with antibiotics but the patient did not respond and wastransferred to ICU where antiviral treatments were initiated but the patient continued todeteriorate and died. In a case series36 of 4 pediatric patients with SARS, all 4 were treated withribavirin and 2 patients required mechanical ventilation during the course of their illness.Mortality was reported in two of the included trials (ribavirin), all 10 cohort studies (ribavirin,lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir), all seven retrospective studies (ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir,oseltamivir), and 21 case reports or case series (ribavirin, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir). Thecomparative studies (trials and cohorts) failed to find statistically significant results indicatingthat none of the antivirals they examined were effective in reducing mortality for SARS orMERS. One cohort study10 of MERS patients found that treatment with ribavirin and interferonssignificantly increased 90-day mortality risk (adjusted odds ratio: 2.27, 95% CI 1.20-4.32). Thepatients in this cohort were generally older (median age 57 (IQR 47-70)) and had a number ofunderlying chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung, renal, orliver disease and malignancy including leukemia or lymphoma which may in part explain theincreased risk. One retrospective study20 of SARS patients found the 21-day mortality rate wassignificantly higher in a cohort of patients treated with ribavirin compared to matched historicalcontrols (6.5%, 95% CI 1.9% to 11.8%). Patients in this study were largely middle aged (34 to57 years of age); however a large proportion of patients that died (approximately 80%) hadunderlying conditions such as diabetes or cancer.The two case series56,57 and one case report35 that included patients with COVID-19 that usedRemdesivir (1 patient), lopinavir/ritonavir (4 cases) and oseltamivir (124 cases) reported 6deaths in the cohort treated with oseltamivir.Special PopulationsThe four cases reports/series29,45,46,48 that included immunosuppressed patients with MERS (5patients) and unspecified coronavirus (2 patients) reported 3 deaths all in patients withhematological malignancies treated with foscarnet (n=1) and oseltamivir (n=2). One patient withHIV and 2 patients with hematological malignancies that acquired MERS were treated withribavirin and oseltamivir respectively and survived after being hospitalized for their illness (38and 28 days respectively). The case report34 of a pregnant woman with MERS treated withoseltamivir and later ribavirin succumbed to septic shock 8 days after admission to hospital. Thetwo case series31,36 that included pediatric patients treated with ribavirin reported no mortality atstudy end.One of the included trials7, seven of the cohort studies9-11,13-15,17, three of the retrospectivestudies20,21,25, and seven case reports/series28,38,39,42,43,50,51 reported treatment related adverseevents while two retrospective studies and three case reports/series reported that no treatmentrelated adverse events occurred. In the trial7 examining the effectiveness ofribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir compared to no treatment as a prophylactic measure for healthcareworkers, treatment-related adverse events were widely reported in the prophylaxis arm,including: GI symptoms (diarrhea n=9, nausea n=9, stomatitis n=4), anemia (n=9), leucopenia(n=8) and hyperbilirubinemia (n=20). All adverse effects occurred during prophylactic therapyand resolved shortly after conclusion of treatment with no further intervention. Overall, the mostcommonly reported adverse events were anemia (n=12 studies) and altered liver function (n=5studies) in patients treated with ribavirin. Other treatment related adverse events includedgastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting), changes in kidney function, cardiac events(e.g., bradycardia, atrial fibrillation), hyperglycemia, and changes in mental status (e.g.,confusion, anxiety). It should be noted however, that in the studies reporting cardiac adverseevents, hyperglycemia, and mental status changes patients were receiving steroids as well asribavirin.Special PopulationsNone of the studies that included special populations reported treatment-related adverseevents.The Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned a rapid review to address the urgentquestion of the effectiveness and safety of antiviral or antibody therapies in the treatment ofcoronavirus. A comprehensive literature search of both electronic databases and grey literaturesources resulted in 54 studies of various antiviral treatments in patients diagnosed withCOVID19, SARS, or MERS; however, no animal or human studies of monoclonal antibodies could befound.Overall the results of the included studies proved inconclusive on the effectiveness of antiviraldrugs in treating coronavirus infections and prevent any particular treatments from beingrecommended for use. There is a low quality of available evidence that largely consists of casereports and case series, with few observational studies, and even fewer trials. There werehowever important safety signals identified in the included studies, particularly the possibledevelopment of anemia and altered liver function in patients receiving ribavirin treatment. It issimilarly difficult to recommend a particular antiviral drug as a promising candidate for furtherinvestigation due to the variable quality and inconclusive results of the current evidence. Thisreview does show however that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towardsstudies of ribavirin which has shown no particular efficacy in treating coronavirus and may infact cause harmful adverse effects. Future investigations into potential antiviral therapies forcoronavirus may be best served by pointing their attention to other drug candidates.There are several limitations to the review methods employed here, single screening andabstraction for example, however they were selected to thoughtfully tailor our methodsaccording to our knowledge user needs and the urgent nature of the request to provide timelyresults.The current evidence for the effectiveness of antiviral therapies for coronavirus is not conclusiveand suffers from a lack of well-designed prospective trials or observational studies. None of theinterventions examined in this review can be recommended for use in patients with coronavirus.Similarly, no firm recommendations can be made for or against these interventions from a safetyperspective due to a lack of conclusive evidence. Some important safety signals potentiallyrelated to ribavirin use were identified (anemia, altered liver function) but also require furtherinvestigation to clarify their relation to the drug.Collaboration TC.

For questions about this report, please contact:Background: To identify safe and effective medical countermeasures (e.g. Of the 21 studies reporting rates of ICU admission in hospitalized SARS or MERSpatients, none reported statistically significant results in favour of or against antiviral therapies. Eighteen studies reported potentialdrugrelated adverse effects including gastrointestinal symptoms, anemia, and altered liver function inpatients receiving ribavirin. However,it is clear that the existing body of evidence is weighted heavily towards ribavirin (41/54 studies),which has not shown conclusive evidence of effectiveness and may cause harmful adverseevents so future investigations may consider focusing on other candidates for antiviral therapy. What is the effectiveness and safety of currently available antiviral therapies used totreat other coronavirus infections?The rapid review conduct was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews ofInterventions1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research2.The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach, with consultation from theknowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada at the following stages: questiondevelopment, literature search, study inclusion, interpretation of results, and draft report. in clinicaltrials.gov and GIDEON (Global Infectious Diseases and EpidemiologyNetwork). Subgroups of interest include older adults aged >65 years, pediatric,pregnant, or immunocompromised patients. Full screening was completed by a single reviewer for both level 1 and level 2 usingSynthesi. A standardized data abstraction form was developed to capture data on the above listed items. The full-text for 29 articles couldnot be obtained in time to be screened for this review and were added to the inventory ofpotentially relevant articles. Common comorbidities included diabetes, heartdisease, hypertension, and renal failure (Appendix 3). At study end(15 days),) two patients tested negative for COVID-19 and were subsequently discharged fromthe hospital and two patients remained hospitalized, one of whom still required mechanicalventilation (Appendix 4). The case reports and series were similarly inconclusive, none of the studyauthors reported a particular advantage for patients with COVID-19, SARS, or MERS treatedwith ribavirin, oseltamivir, or lopinavir/ritonavir. The patients were all treated with oseltamivir and one patient required admission tothe ICU due to worsening symptoms. One case report34 of a pregnant woman with MERSdescribed initially attempting treatment with antibiotics but the patient did not respond and wastransferred to ICU where antiviral treatments were initiated but the patient continued todeteriorate and died. In a case series36 of 4 pediatric patients with SARS, all 4 were treated withribavirin and 2 patients required mechanical ventilation during the course of their illness. Special PopulationsThe four cases reports/series29,45,46,48 that included immunosuppressed patients with MERS (5patients) and unspecified coronavirus (2 patients) reported 3 deaths all in patients withhematological malignancies treated with foscarnet (n=1) and oseltamivir (n=2). All adverse effects occurred during prophylactic therapyand resolved shortly after conclusion of treatment with no further intervention.
