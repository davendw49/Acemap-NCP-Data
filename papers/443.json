Despite intense research eofrts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975\u00a0cases had been reported since the rifst patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing4 of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage uflid from the patient identiefid a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae, which is designated here 'WH-Human 1' coronavirus (and has also been referred to as '2019-nCoV'). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903\u00a0nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China5. This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.", "text": "performed deep meta-transcriptomic sequencing. The clinicalspecimen was handled in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at ShanghaiPublic Health Clinical Center. Total RNA was extracted from 200\u00a0\u03bclof BALF and a meta-transcriptomic library was constructedfor\u00a0pairend (150-bp reads) sequencing using an Illumina MiniSeq aspreviously described4,6\u20138. In total, we generated 56,565,928\u00a0sequence readsthat were de\u00a0novo-assembled and screened for potential aetiologicalagents. Of the 384,096\u00a0contigs assembled by Megahit9, the longest(30,474\u00a0nucleotides (nt)) had a high abundance and was closely relatedto a bat SARS-like coronavirus (CoV) isolate\u2014bat SL-CoVZC45 (GenBankaccession number MG772933)\u2014that had previously been sampled inChina, with a nucleotide identity of 89.1% (Supplementary Tables\u00a01, 2).The genome sequence of this virus, as well as its termini, weredetermined and confirmed by reverse-transcription PCR (RT\u2013PCR)10 and5\u2032/3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), respectively. This virusstrain was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and hasalso been referred to as \u20182019-nCoV\u2019) and its whole genome sequence(29,903\u00a0nt) has been assigned GenBank accession number MN908947.Remapping the RNA-sequencing data to the complete genome of WHCVresulted in an assembly of 123,613\u00a0reads, providing 99.99% genomecoverage at a mean depth of 6.04\u00d7 (range, 0.01\u201378.84\u00d7) (ExtendedData Fig.\u00a03). The viral load in the BALF sample was estimated by qPCRto be 3.95\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0copies per ml (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04).The viral genome organization of WHCV was determined by sequencealignment to two representative members of the genusBetacoronavirus: a coronavirus associated with humans (SARS-CoV Tor2, GenBankaccession number AY274119) and a coronavirus associated with bats(bat SL-CoVZC45, GenBank accession number MG772933). Theuntranslational regions and open-reading frame (ORF) of WHCV weremapped on the basis of this sequence alignment and ORF prediction.The WHCV viral genome was similar to these two coronaviruses (Fig.\u00a01and Supplementary Table\u00a03). The order of genes (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) was as follows:replicase ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M)\u00a0andnucleocapsid (N). WHCV has 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal sequences that are typicalof betacoronaviruses, with 265\u00a0nt at the 5\u2032 terminal end and 229\u00a0nt atthe 3\u2032 terminal end. The predicted replicase ORF1ab gene of WHCV is21,291\u00a0nt in length and contained 16 predicted non-structural proteins(Supplementary Table\u00a04), followed by (at least) 13 downstream ORFs.Additionally, WHCV shares a highly conserved domain (LLRKNGNKG:amino acids 122\u2013130) in nsp1 with SARS-CoV. The predicted S, ORF3a,E, M and N genes of WHCV are 3,822, 828, 228, 669 and 1,260\u00a0nt in length,respectively. In addition to these ORF regions, which are shared by allmembers of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, WHCV is similar to SARS-CoVin that it carries a predicted ORF8 gene (with a length of 366\u00a0nt) that islocated between the M and N ORF genes. The functions of WHCV ORFswere predicted on the basis of those of known coronaviruses and aredescribed in Supplementary Table\u00a05. In a manner similar to SARS-CoVTor2, a leader transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and nineputative body TRSs could be readily identified upstream of the 5\u2032 end of theORF in WHCV, and the putative conserved TRS core sequence appearedin two forms\u2014ACGAAC or CUAAAC (Supplementary Table\u00a06).To determine the evolutionary relationships between WHCV andpreviously identified coronaviruses, we estimated phylogenetic trees onthe basis of the nucleotide sequences of the whole-genome sequence,the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and ORF1b, and the mainstructural proteins encoded by the S, E, M and N genes (Fig.\u00a02 and ExtendedData Fig.\u00a05). In all phylogenies, WHCV clustered with members of thesubgenus Sarbecovirus, including the SARS-CoV that was responsiblefor the global SARS pandemic1,2 of 2002\u20132003, as well as a numberof SARS-like coronaviruses that have been obtained from bats5,11\u201313.However, WHCV changed topological position within the subgenusSarbecovirus depending on which gene was used, which suggests thatrecombination has occurred in this group of viruses in the past (Fig.\u00a02and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05). Specifically, in the S gene tree (ExtendedData Fig.\u00a05), WHCV was most closely related to the bat coronavirusSL-CoVZC45 with 82.3% amino acid identity (and around 77.2% aminoacid identity to SARS-CoV; Supplementary Table\u00a03) whereas in the2,0006,0008,00010,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 18,000 20,000 22,000 24,000 26,000 28,000Position100100100100100100100EriCoVMERS-CoVTy-BatCoV HKU4Pi-BatCoV HKU5Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1100 BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018Ro-BatCoV HKU9Bat Hp-BetaCoV HibecovirusWHCVBat CoV BM48-31/BGR/2008100Bat SARS-CoV HKU3Bat SL-CoVZC45Bat SL-CoVZXC21BtCoV/279/2005Bat SARS-CoV Rm196 BtCoV Rp/Shaanxi2011BtRf-BetaCoV/JL2012Bat CoV JTMC15BtRf-BetaCoV/HeB2013BtRf-BetaCoV/SX2013100 Bat SARS-CoV Rf199 BtCoV/273/2005BtCoV Cp/Yunnan2011LYRa11BtRl-BetaCoV/SC2018Bat SARS-like CoV YNLF 34C99 Civet SARS-CoV SZ3SARS-CoV BJ01100 SARS-CoV TOR2SARS-CoV WH20100 Bat SARS-like CoV Rs4231100 Bat SARS-like CoV Rs487497 Bat SARS-like CoV WIV1698 BtRs-BetaCoV/YN201396 BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018C99 BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B97 BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018DBat SARS-like CoV Rf409219060 Bat SARS-like CoV RsSHC01496 Bat SARS-like CoV Rs3367Bat SARS-like CoV WIV199 BtRs-BetaCoV/GX2013Bat SARS-CoV Rp389 BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018A94 Bat SARS-CoV Rs672EmbecovirusNobecovirus10080HCoV-HKU1MHVChRCoV HKU24HCoV-OC43EriCoVTy-BatCoV HKU4Pi-BatCoV HKU5 MerbecovirusMERS-CoV99 Ro-BatCoV HKU9BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1Bat Hp-BetaCoVWHCV81 Bat SL-CoVZC4597 Bat SL-CoVZXC2199 Bat CoV BM48-31/BGR/2008BtCoV Cp/Yunnan201179 LYRa11BtRs-BetaCoV/GX201388 BtCoV/279/200599 Bat SARS-CoV Rm1Bat SARS-CoV HKU3Bat SARS-CoV Rp399 BtCoV Rp/Shaanxi2011BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2013BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018C87 Bat SARS-like CoV Rs4231BtRl-BetaCoV/SC201877 Civet SARS-CoV SZ3Hibecovirus93 SSAARRSS--CCooVV BWJH021074 SARS-CoV TOR2BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018ABtRf-BetaCoV/HeB201382 BtRf-BetaCoV/SX2013BtRf-BetaCoV/JL201299 Bat CoV JTMC15BtCoV/273/2005Bat SARS-CoV Rf199 Bat SARS-like CoV YNLF 34CBat SARS-like CoV Rf4092Bat SARS-like CoV Rs4874Bat SARS-like CoV Rs3367Bat SARS-like CoV WIV197 Bat SARS-like CoV WIV1689 BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018D75 BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018BBat SARS-like CoV RsSHC014Bat SARS-CoV Rs67298100c0.57199897791987091100EmbecovirusMerbecovirusChRCoV HKU24HCoV-OC43HCoV-HKU1MHV0 0 200 400 600 800 1,0001,012,2900 1,400 1,600 1,16,58200 2,000 2,200 2,400 2,600 2,800 3,000 3,200 3,400 3,600 3,800PositionData Fig.\u00a07a). By contrast, other bat SARS-like CoVs\u2014including the Rp3strain that cannot bind to human ACE214\u2014had amino acid deletionsat positions 433\u2013437 and 460\u2013472 compared with the sequence inSARS-CoVs (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a). The previously determined15 crystalstructure of the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV complexed withhuman ACE2 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2AJF) revealed that regions433\u2013437 and 460\u2013472 directly interact with human ACE2 and hencemay be important in determining species specificity (Extended DataFig.\u00a07b). We predicted the three-dimensional protein structures of theRBD domains of the spike protein of WHCV, Rs4874 and Rp3 by proteinhomology modelling using the SWISS-MODEL server and comparedthem to the crystal structure of RBD domain of the spike protein ofSARS-CoV (PDB 2GHV) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07c\u2013f). In accordance withthe sequence alignment, the predicted protein structures of the RBDdomains of WHCV and Rs4874 were closely related to that of SARS-CoVand different from the predicted structure of the RBD domain fromRp3. In addition, the N terminus of the spike protein of WHCV is moresimilar to that of SARS-CoV than other human coronaviruses (HKU1and OC43) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08) that can bind to sialic acid16. Insummary, the high similarities of the amino acid sequences and predictedprotein structures of the RBD domains of WHCV and SARS-CoV suggestthat WHCV may efficiently use human ACE2 as a receptor for cellularentry, which could potentially facilitate human-to-humantransmission11,17,18.To further characterize the putative recombination events in theevolutionary history of the sarbecoviruses, the whole-genome sequenceof WHCV and four representative coronaviruses\u2014bat SARS-like CoVRp3, CoVZC45, CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV Tor2\u2014were analysed using theRecombination Detection Program v.4 (RDP4)19. Although thesimilarity plots suggested that possible recombination events had occurredbetween WHCV and SARS-CoVs or SARS-like CoVs (Extended DataFig.\u00a09), there was no significant evidence for recombination across the4 | Nature | www.nature.comgenome as a whole. However, some evidence for past recombinationwas detected in the S gene of WHCV, SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs(WIV1 and RsSHC014) (P\u00a0<\u00a03.147\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 to P\u00a0<\u00a09.198\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129), for which thesimilarity plots suggested the presence of recombination breakpointsat nucleotides 1,029 and 1,652, which separate the S gene of WHCV intothree regions (Fig.\u00a03). In phylogenies of the nucleotide fragments from1 to 1,029 and from 1,652 to the end of the sequence, WHCV was mostclosely related to bat SL-CoVZC45 and bat SL-CoVZXC21, whereas in theregion of nucleotides 1,030 to 1,651 (the RBD region) WHCV groupedwith SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs (WIV1 and RsSHC014) that arecapable of direct human transmission17,20. Despite these recombinationevents, which seem relatively common among sarbecoviruses, there isno evidence that recombination has facilitated the emergence of WHCV.Coronaviruses are associated with a number of infectious diseaseoutbreaks in humans, including SARS in 2002\u20132003 and Middle Eastrespiratory syndrome (MERS) in 20121,21. Four other coronaviruses\u2014human coronaviruses HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E\u2014are alsoassociated with respiratory disease22\u201325. Although SARS-like coronaviruseshave been widely identified in mammals including bats since 2005 inChina10,26\u201328, the exact origin of human-infected coronaviruses remainsunclear. Here we describe a new coronavirus\u2014WHCV\u2014in the BALF froma patient who experienced severe respiratory disease in Wuhan, China.Phylogenetic analysis suggests that WHCV is a member of the genusBetacoronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus) that has some genomic andphylogenetic similarities to SARS-CoV1, particularly in the RBD of thespike protein. These genomic and clinical similarities to SARS, as well asits high abundance in clinical samples, provides evidence for anassociation between WHCV and the ongoing outbreak of respiratory diseasein Wuhan and across the world. Although the isolation of the virusfrom only a single patient is not sufficient to conclude that it causedthese respiratory symptoms, our findings have been independentlycorroborated in further patients in a separate study29.The identification of multiple SARS-like CoVs in bats have led tothe idea that these animals act as hosts of a natural reservoir of theseviruses22,23. Although SARS-like viruses have been identified widely inbats in China, viruses identical to SARS-CoV have not yet beendocumented. Notably, WHCV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses,and shows 100% amino acid similarity to bat SL-CoVZC45 in the nsp7and E proteins (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Thus, these data suggest thatbats are a possible host for the viral reservoir of WHCV. However, as avariety of animal species were for sale in the market when the diseasewas first reported, further studies are needed to determine the naturalreservoir and any intermediate hosts of WHCV.Note added in proof: Since this paper was accepted, the ICTV hasdesignated the virus as SARS-CoV-230; in addition, the WHO has releasedthe official name of the disease caused by this virus, which is COVID-1931.Any methods, additional references, Nature Research reportingsummaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information,acknowledgements, peer review information; details of authorcontributions and competing interests; and statements of data and codeavailability are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3.Publisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims inpublished maps and institutional affiliations.Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distributionand reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriatecredit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence,and indicate if changes were made.

Theexperiments were not randomized and the investigators were notblinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.Patient information and collection of clinical data and sampleA patient presenting with acute onset of fever (temperature over37.5\u2009\u00b0C), cough and chest tightness, who was admitted to the CentralHospital of Wuhan, in Wuhan, China, was considered to be a suspectedcase. During admission, BALF was collected and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0Cuntil further processing. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datawere retrieved from the clinical records of the patient. The study wasreviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the NationalInstitute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Centerfor Disease Control and Prevention. Signed written informed consentwas obtained from the patient.Total RNA was extracted from the BALF sample using the RNeasy PlusUniversal Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.The quantity and quality of the RNA solution was assessed using a Qbitmachine and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) beforelibrary construction and sequencing. An RNA library was thenconstructed using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq kit v.2 (TaKaRa).Ribosomal RNA depletion was performed during libraryconstruction following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Paired-end (150-bpreads) sequencing of the RNA library was performed on the MiniSeqplatform (Illumina). Library preparation and sequencing were carriedout at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University,Shanghai, China.Data processing and identification of the viral agentSequencing reads were first adaptor and quality trimmed using theTrimmomatic program32. The remaining 56,565,928\u00a0reads wereassembled de\u00a0novo using both Megahit (v.1.1.3)9 and Trinity (v.2.5.1)33 withdefault parameter settings. Megahit generated a total of 384,096assembled contigs (size range of 200\u201330,474\u00a0nt), whereas Trinity generated1,329,960\u00a0contigs with a size range of 201\u201311,760\u00a0nt. All of theseassembled contigs were compared (using BLASTn and Diamond BLASTx)against the entire non-redundant (nr) nucleotide and protein databases,with e values set to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210 and 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125, respectively. To identify possibleaetiological agents present in the sequencing data, the abundanceof the assembled contigs was first evaluated as the expected countsusing the RSEM program34 implemented in Trinity. Non-human reads(23,712,657\u00a0reads), generated by filtering host reads using the humangenome (human release 32, GRCh38.p13, downloaded from Gencode)by Bowtie235, were used for the RSEM abundance assessment.As the longest contigs generated by Megahit (30,474\u00a0nt) andTrinity (11,760\u00a0nt) both showed high similarity to the bat SARS-likecoronavirus isolate bat SL-CoVZC45 and were found at a high abundance(Supplementary Tables\u00a01, 2), the longer sequence (30,474\u00a0nt)\u2014whichcovered almost the whole virus genome\u2014was used for primer design forPCR confirmation and determination of the genome termini. Primersused for PCR, qPCR and RACE experiments are listed inSupplementary Table\u00a08. The PCR assay was conducted as previously\u00a0described10and the complete genome termini was determined using the TakaraSMARTer RACE 5\u2032/3\u2032 kit (TaKaRa) following the manufacturer\u2019sinstructions. Subsequently, the genome coverage and sequencing depth weredetermined by remapping all of the adaptor- and quality-trimmedreads to the whole genome of WHCV using Bowtie235 and Samtools36.The viral loads of WHCV in BALF were determined by quantitativereal-time RT\u2013PCR using the Takara One Step PrimeScript RT\u2013PCR kit(Takara RR064A) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-timeRT\u2013PCR was performed using 2.5\u00a0\u03bcl RNA with 8\u00a0pmol of each primerand 4\u00a0pmol probe under the following conditions: reverse transcriptionat 42\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, 95\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, followed by 40\u00a0cycles of 95\u2009\u00b0C for15\u00a0s and 60\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min. The reactions were performed and detectedby ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems. The PCR product covering theTaqman primers and probe region was cloned into pLB vector usingthe Lethal Based Simple Fast Cloning Kit (TianGen) as standards forquantitative viral load test.Virus genome characterization and phylogenetic analysisFor the newly identified virus genome, the potential ORFs werepredicted and annotated using the conserved signatures of the cleavagesites recognized by coronavirus proteinases, and were processed inthe Lasergene software package (v.7.1, DNAstar). The viral genes werealigned using the L-INS-i algorithm implemented in MAFFT (v.7.407)37.          Phylogenetic analyses were then performed using the nucleotidesequences of various CoV gene datasets: (          Potential recombination events in the history of the sarbecoviruseswere assessed using both the RDP419 and Simplot (v.3.5.1)40. The RDP4analysis was conducted based on the complete genome (nucleotide)sequence, using RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, maximum chi square,Chimera, SISCAN and 3SEQ methods. Putative recombination eventswere identified with a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 0.01.Similarity plots were inferred using Simplot to further characterizepotential recombination events, including the location of possiblebreakpoints.Analysis of the RBD domain of the spike protein of WHCVAn amino acid sequence alignment of RBD sequences from WHCV,SARS-CoVs and bat SARS-like CoVs was performed using MUSCLE41.The predicted protein structures of the RBD of the spike protein wereestimated based on target\u2013template alignment using ProMod3 onSWISS-MODEL server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). The sequencesof the RBD domains spike of WHCV, Rs4874 and Rp3 were searchedby BLAST against the primary amino acid sequence contained in theSWISS-MODEL template library (last update, 9 January 2020; lastincluded PDB release, 3 January 2020). Models were built based onthe target\u2013template alignment using ProMod3. The global andperresidue model quality was assessed using the QMEAN scoringfunction42. The PDB files of the predicted protein structures were displayedand compared with the crystal structures of the spike RBD of SARS-CoV(PDB 2GHV)43 and the crystal of structure of the spike RBD of SARS-CoVcomplexed with human ACE2 (PDB 2AJF)15.Further information on research design is available in the\u00a0NatureResearch Reporting Summary linked to this paper.Sequence reads generated in this study are available from the NCBISequence Read Archive (SRA) database under BioProject accessionnumber PRJNA603194.

We studied one patient, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from him who exhibited severerespiratory syndrome including fever, dizzy and cough. Since it is a discovery study, the number of individuals is irrelevant to the conclusionsdrawn in the paper.The de novo assembly of reads was performed using two programs.The whole genome viral sequence obtained from read assembly was confirmed by PCR assays.The results from phylogenetic and recombination analyses were confirmed by multiple runs.Not applicable. The goal of this study was to find out the possible aetiologic agent associated with the severe respiratory disease occurredrecently in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Since we could obtain the BALF sample from only one patient who exhibited severerespiratory syndrome including fever, dizzy and cough, hence, randomization was not applicable to this study.Not applicable.
