However, some defectsmake the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning ofpatients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening ofhighly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables.METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positiveresult were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses wereperformed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curve analysis were used for model validation.RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever,neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnosticmodel. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 earlywarning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicatedthat both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001];validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (trainingdataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P< 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off valuesof disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count,and so on.CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for earlyand relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.COVID-19; Diagnostic model; Disease screening; Scoring tool; SARS-CoV-2The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is erupting worldwide.1-4 Due to thenegative effects it brought, the World Health Organization (WTO) defined the outbreak apublic health emergency of international concern on January 31th, 2020.5 As early asDecember 2019, the COVID-19 epidemic were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.In a short period of time, the number of COVID-19 confirmed patients in Zhejiang Provincealso increase rapidly.6,7Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 relies mainly on SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection.However, due to the shortcomings of false-negative results caused by the low viral load inthe samples and relatively insufficient detection kits, many patients cannot be detected intime. Although clinical symptoms, epidemiological exposure history and computedtomography (CT) manifestations have been added to the diagnostic criteria of the disease,the atypical early clinical symptoms, unclear epidemiological exposure history andambiguous imaging conclusions also bring difficulties to the screening of the patients.6,8An effective and simple multi-parameter diagnostic tool is urgently needed.Our study selected the clinical data of patients who came to our hospital during the firstphase of the epidemic (by February 5th, 2020, most of the confirmed patients were fromWuhan or had a clear history of close contact with the returning population from Wuhan)as the training dataset. By comparing the characteristics of the confirmed cases andexcluding cases, the independent risk factors related to the disease were identified andincluded in the diagnostic model. The purpose of establishing a multifaceted diagnosticmodel is to improve the detection rate and detection speed of infected patients, so as totruly achieve early detection, early isolation and early treatment to curb the furtherdevelopment of the epidemic.We included clinical data of a total of 1,311 patients who came to the First AffiliatedHospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University and performed at least onceSARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection for analysis. This study was approved by the EthicalCommittee of the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University (codenumber IIT20200025A). Data of patients between January 20th, 2020 and February 5th,2020 were enrolled into training dataset, and between February 6th, 2020 and February19th, 2020 were enrolled into validate dataset. All patients who had a positiveSARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection result were classified into COVID-19 group, while theothers were classified into non-COVID-19 group. Due to the huge number ofnon-COVID-19 group patients, we eliminated the enrolled patients according to thefollowing steps: (1) all negative patients from the COVID-19 designated district, ZhijiangDistrict of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine; (2)negative outpatients from Qingchun District were sorted by \"Z-A\" based on Chinese firstname, the first 60% between January 20th, 2020 and February 5th, 2020, and the first 40%between February 6th, 2020 and February 19th, 2020 were included. Exclusion criteria: (1)asymptomatic patients without history of exposure but had strong willingness for detection;(2) patients with important information deficits. Figure 1 presented the concreteprocedures of patients screening. The definitions of severity was based on the NewCoronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition) published by theNational Health Commission of China9: (1) mild: patients had no pneumonia on imaging;(2) moderate: patients with symptoms and imaging examination shows pneumonia; (3)severe: patients meet any of the following: (i) respiratory rate \u2265 30/min; (ii) resting pulseoxygen saturation (SpO2) \u2264 93%; (iii) partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction ofinspired oxygen (FiO2) \u2264 300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa); (iiii) multiple pulmonary lobesshowing more than 50% progression of lesion in 24-48 hours on imaging; (4) critical:patients meet any of the following: (i) respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation; (ii)shock; (iii) combination of other organ failure that requires admitted into intensive care unit(ICU). Mild or moderate patients were included in the non-severe group, and severe orcritical patients were included in the severe group.CT report by default.Laboratory confirmation was achieved by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 according to the protocol established by theWHO.10 Sputum samples were preferred in our hospital for RT-PCR assay within 3 hours.Two target genes of SARS-CoV-2 were tested during the process, including open readingframe 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsidprotein (N).The CT scores were analyzed retrospectively by two radiologists blinded to the patient\u2019sdiagnosis and other clinical features. Two lung is divided into the upper (above tracheajuga), middle (between trachea juga and pulmonary vein) and lower (under pulmonaryvein) parts. According to the area occupied by different CT signs in each region: normallung tissue, 0 points; lesion area < 25% of this layer, 1 point; 25% ~ 50%, 2 points; 50% ~75%, 3 points; > 75% 4 points. The score of each part were added to obtain the final CTscore.11Continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR).Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages in each category.Mann-Whitney U-test were used to evaluate continuous data. Chi-square test were usedfor categorical variables. Independent risk factor analysis was performed usingmultivariate logistic regression analyses with forward stepwise method. The discriminationcapacity of the diagnostic model and COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS)were accessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic(AUROC) curve. All statistical analyses were done by SPSS statistical software package(version 25.0). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.A total of 304 patients were enrolled in the training dataset , including 73 patients in theCOVID-19 group and 231 patients in the non-COVID-19 group (Table 1). There was ahigher proportion of males in the COVID-19 group (63.0% vs 37.0%, P = 0.007). Patientsin COVID-19 group had a higher age distribution than non-COVID-19 group (53 years[IQR, 43.5-62.0] vs 34 years [IQR, 29.0-49.0]; P < 0.001). As for epidemiological exposure,proportion of the patients with history of Wuhan-related exposure and close contact washigher than the COVID-19 group (57.5% vs 40.7%, P = 0.012; 34.2% vs 5.6%, P < 0.001).Patients in the COVID-19 group had a longer out-hospital disease course than thenon-COVID-19 group (7 [IQR, 4.0-9.0] vs 3 [IQR, 1.0-5.0]; P < 0.001). More patients in theCOVID-19 group showed fever (94.5% vs 68.0%, P < 0.001), dyspnea (21.9% vs 8.7%, P= 0.002), cough (60.3% vs 45.9%, P = 0.032), expectoration (23.3% vs 12.6%, P = 0.026),and myalgia or fatigue (32.9% vs 19.9%, P = 0.022). On the other hand, more patients inthe non-COVID-19 group showed pharyngalgia (22.9% vs 6.8%, P = 0.002), andrhinobyon or rhinorrhoea (10.4% vs 1.4%, P = 0.014). In addition, patients in theCOVID-19 group had a higher maximum body temperature (Tmax) during the outhospitalphase (38.2 \u2103 [IQR,37.5-39.0], P < 0.001) and a lower SpO2 (97.0% [IQR, 95.0-99.0] vs98.0% [98.0-99.0], P < 0.001).As shown in Table 1, the white blood cell count (P = 0.002), lymphocyte count (P < 0.001),monocyte count (P < 0.001), and platelet count (P < 0.001) were lower in the COVID-19group than the non-COVID-19 group. Although neutrophil count had no obvious difference,the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group(5.00 [IQR, 2.2-13.9] vs 2.7 [1.7-4.7], P < 0.001). Many indicators associated withinflammation or cell damage were increased, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartateaminotransferase(AST), lactosedehydrogenase(LDH),andhydroxybutyratedehydrogenase (HBDH) (all P < 0.001). Nearly all patients (95.9%) in the COVID-19 hadsigns of pneumonia on CT scans. Only 26.4% patients in the non-COVID-19 group hadabnormal findings on lung CT scans, and some of them were considered as bacteria orother virus infection.Variables with P < 0.05 were selected to perform multivariate logistic regression analysisby using the forward stepwise method. In order to facilitate the later establishment of ascoring tool, NLR and Tmax were transformed into a categorical variable (< 5.8 / \u2265 5.8; <37.8 / \u2265 37.8) based on the cut-off value. Signs of pneumonia on CT, history of closecontact, fever, NLR, Tmax and sex were considered as the independent factors related tothe onset of COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 1). The equation was derived: Probability(COVID-19) = 1 / 1 + exp - [ -9.106 + (2.79 x Fever) + (4.58 x History of close contact) +(5.10 x Signs of pneumonia on CT) + (0.97 x NLR) + (0.94 x Tmax) + (0.90 x Sex)].To further improve the operability of this diagnostic model, we converted the betacoefficient values into score. Other significant parameters, age and meaningful lowerrespiratory symptoms, were also included into the COVID-19 EWS (Figure 2A). Accordingto the results of ROC curve analysis, a cut-off value of 10 was selected as the threshold todistinguish COVID-19 patient, with sensitivity and specificity of 0.932 and 0.874,respectively. As SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid positive is the accepted standard for COVID-19diagnosis, and all positive patients need isolated observation and/or treatment, we did notinclude this single item in COVID-19 EWS.In order to determine whether the diagnostic model and COVID-19 EWS are advantageous,we compared their diagnostic capacity to SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection and CT scan(Figure 2B-F). We used the first SARS-CoV-2 nucleicacid detection result to value itssensitivity and specificity. Results showed that although nucleicacid detection had a highspecificity, its sensitivity was lower than COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.918 vs 0.932;validate dataset 0.889 vs 0.944). Screening only by CT scan had a high sensitivity, but lowspecificity (training dataset 0.737 vs 0.874; validate dataset 0.737 vs 0.842). Either of thediagnostic model or the COVID-19 EWS had a quite large AUROC both in the trainingdataset and the validation dataset.We compared the clinical data between the severe group and the non-severe group to findpredictive factors of COVID-19 disease severity (Table 2).The median age of the severegroup was higher than the non-severe group (55.5 years [IQR 48.0-64.3] vs 48 years [IQR37.0-59.0], P < 0.001), indicating that older patients were more likely to develop severeillness. The proportion of male patients in the severe group was great larger than that offemale (71.4% vs 28.6%). Percentage of patients with hypertension was higher in severegroup (22 [52.4%] vs 4 [12.9%], P < 0.001), while other coexisting disorders, includingdiabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed nosignificant differences. In addition, many laboratory items and CT score presentingsignificant differences too. In order to better distinguish severe and non-severe patients,we defined the new threshold value of the selected parameters (P < 0.05) by calculatingthe cut-off value using ROC curve analysis. Table 3 showed the parameters with AUROC >0.60.The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 is intensifying.12 As the main battlefield on the first stage,early detection and effective quarantine of patients and close contacts has made the epidemicin China so far under effective control. However, practice has shown that detection of highlysuspected patients remains problematic. Considering the relative shortage of SARS-CoV-2nucleicacid detection kits and false-negative results caused by various reasons, such as thequality of the samples taken, the number of viruses and the stage of the disease, medicalexperts have proposed screening of highly suspected patients with lung CT. However, due tomild COVID-19 patients are defined as no pneumonia on imaging, and imaging findings ofsome patients are atypical, screening based on CT findings is greatly dependent on thephysician's experience and the effectiveness is limited. All the above reasons increase thediagnosis difficult of COVID-19 patients when they first come to the doctors.In our study, we firstly developed a diagnostic model based on multivariate logisticregression analysis. Since this diagnostic model was a logistic regression equation andinconvenient to operate in clinical environment, we converted the diagnostic model into anscoring tool by assigning values to each variable in the equation. Besides of that, weenrolled two more parameters into the final COVID-19 EWS, including age and meaningfulrespiratory symptoms. Based on the statistical analysis, we found that elderly people weremore susceptible to COVID-19 and develop severe, which may due to their lower diseaseresistance and more basic diseases; some significant symptoms, such as cough,expectoration and dyspnea, can help to strengthen the association between fever and lowerrespiratory symptoms and weaken the weight of fever caused by other reasons. As a result,theCOVID-19EWScontainedeasy-to-get parameters on clinical manifestation,epidemiological characteristics, basic vital signs, laboratory and radiologic data, which providea more comprehensive assessment of patients. Through re-evaluation in the validation datasetand comparison with other methods, results showed that both of our diagnostic model andCOVID-19 EWS had relatively high and stable sensitivity and specificity.The clinical features of patients in our medical center were similar to those reported in previousstudies13-15: Male were more susceptible to COVID-19 but had no significance to predict ofdisease severity in our study may due to the small sample size, although the male to femaleratio was quite high in the severe group (71.4 vs 28.6); most patients had initial symptoms offever and cough; as for laboratory results, the decrease of white blood cell, lymphocyte,monocyte, and platelet, and the increase of the levels of ESR, CRP, Cr, serum urea nitrogen,LDH, and HBDH were found in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infectionmay be associated with the injury of cellular immune, cardiomyocytes, liver and kidney.16 NLRwas a widely used marker for the assessment of the severity of bacterial infections and theprognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumors.17-19 In our study, we also found the increaseof NLR in COVID-19 patients, and it was positively related to the disease severity.Consistent with a previous study, we found CD4+ T cell count and CD8+ T cell count werenegatively correlated to the severity of COVID-19, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may direct orindirect damage to T lymphocytes and further aggravates disease progression.20,21 Althoughinflammatory cytokine storms were thought to be a mechanism for COVID-19 progression,15we did not find an significantly increased level of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3.These findings might due to the limited size of our study and the large heterogeneity at thetime-points of the first detection.There were also many shortcomings in our study that should be considered. Firstly, it was aretrospective study, which might contain selection bias, although we tried to avoid the biasthrough sorting patients by \"Z-A\" based on Chinese first name and strictly abide the inclusionand exclusion criteria. In addition, because of the incomplete of potentially valuableinformation, such as smoking history and basic diseases, we cannot conduct a comprehensiveanalysis of these factors currently. Besides of that, additional multi-center, multi-ethnic andprospective studies are expected to revised our diagnostic model and COVID-19 EWS, andwe also plan to implement a multi-center study with a larger sample size to further validate andoptimize the model. More over, it is hoped that better statistical algorithms will make thediagnostic model more practical.We established a novel and easy-to-get early warning score for COVID-19 screening. Thisscoring tool allows clinicians to more quickly and relatively accurately detect COVID-19patients, especially when the nucleicacid detection capacity is relatively lacking.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.We thank for Ying-ying Mao, Ph.D., providing the help on statistical analyses.Li Q, Guan X, Wu P, et al.
