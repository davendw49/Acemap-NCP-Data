Here we reportthe development of SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR, a rapid (~30 min), low-cost, and accurateCRISPR-Cas12 based lateral flow assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We validatedthis method using contrived reference samples and clinical samples from infected USpatients and demonstrated comparable performance to the US CDC SARS-CoV-2realtime RT-PCR assay.Over the past 40 years, there have been recurrent large-scale epidemics fromnovel emerging viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS andMERS coronaviruses, 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, Ebola virus (EBOV), Zika46virus (ZIKV), and most recently SARS-CoV-21,2. All of these epidemics presumably47 resulted from an initial zoonotic animal-to-human transmission event, with eitherclinically apparent or occult spread into vulnerable human populations. Each time, a49 lack of rapid, accessible, and accurate molecular diagnostic testing has hindered thepublic health response to the emerging viral threat.        I        Here we report the development and initial validation of a CRISPR (clustered66 regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas12 based assay8-11 for detection ofSARS-CoV-2 from extracted patient sample RNA in approximately 30 minutes, calledSARS-CoV-2 DETECTR. This assay performs simultaneous reverse transcription andUnited States, the FDA on February 28th, 2020 permitted individual clinically licensed63 laboratories to report the results of in-house developed SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays69 isothermal amplification using loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP)12 from RNA70extracted from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in universal transport media71 (UTM), followed by Cas12 detection of predefined coronavirus sequences, after whichcleavage of a reporter molecule confirms detection of the virus. We first designedprimers targeting the E (envelope) and N (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.1a). The primers amplify regions that overlap the WHO assay (E gene region) and USCDC assay (N2 region in the N gene)6,13, but are modified to meet design requirements76 for LAMP. We did not target the N1 and N3 regions used by the US CDC assay, as77 these regions lacked suitable protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites for the Cas127273747578798081828384858687899091guide RNAs (gRNAs). Next, we designed Cas12 gRNAs to detect three SARS-likecoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 accession NC_045512, bat SARS-like coronavirus(batSL-CoVZC45, accession MG772933), and SARS-CoV, accession NC_004718)) in the Egene and specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 only in the N gene (Supplementary Fig. 1).nuclease-free water, we demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas12 based detection candistinguish SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity for related coronavirus strains (Fig. 1b,Supplementary Fig. 2). We then optimized the conditions for the SARS-CoV-2DETECTR assay on the E gene, N gene and the human RNase P gene as a control,which consists of an RT-LAMP reaction at 62\u00b0C for 20 min and Cas12 detection88 reaction at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. The DETECTR assay can be run in approximately 30minutes and visualized on a lateral flow strip (Fig. 1c, d). The SARS-CoV-2 DETECTRassay requires detection of both the E and N genes to confirm a positive test (Fig. 1e),and interpretation is consistent with that for the CDC assay N1 and N2 genes (the N3949596979910010210310410510610710810911092gene target region for the CDC assay is no longer being used due to concerns93 regarding flaws in manufacturing reagents and potential decreased sensitivity)14.We next compared the analytic limits of detection (LoD) of the RT-LAMP/Cas12DETECTR assay relative to the US FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approvedCDC assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1; Fig. 2d). A standard curve forquantitation was constructed using 7 dilutions of a control IVT viral nucleoprotein RNA98 (\u201cCDC VTC nCoV Transcript\u201d)6, with 3 replicates at each dilution (Fig. 2d, left;101 right; Supplementary Fig. 3). The estimated LoD for the CDC assay tested byExtended Data 1). Ten two-fold serial dilutions of the same control nucleoprotein RNAwere then used to run the DETECTR assay, with 6 replicates at each dilution (Fig. 2d,California Department of Public Health was 1 copy/\u00b5L reaction, consistent with theanalytic performance in the FDA package insert, versus 10 copies/\u00b5L reaction for theWe then assessed the capability of the RT-LAMP assay to amplify SARS-CoV-2nucleic acid directly from raw sample matrix consisting of nasopharyngeal swabs fromasymptomatic donors placed in universal transport medium (UTM) or phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and spiked with SARS-CoV-2 IVT target RNA. Assayperformance was degraded at reaction concentration of \u226510% UTM and \u226520% PBS byvolume, with estimated limits of detection decreasing to 500 and 1,500 copies/\u00b5L,111 respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4).112Finally, we tested extracted RNA from 11 respiratory swab samples collected113 from 6 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients (COVID19-1A/B to COVID19-5A/B, where114A=nasopharyngeal swab and B=oropharyngeal swab and COVID19-6, a single115nasopharyngeal swab) and 12 nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with116 influenza (n=4), common human seasonal coronavirus infections (n=3, representingOC43, HKU1, NL63), and healthy donors (n=5) (Fig. 2e, f; Supplementary Fig. 5).Relative to the CDC qRT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR was 90% sensitive and 100%specific for detection of the coronavirus in respiratory swab samples, corresponding topositive and negative predictive values of 100% and 91.7%, respectively (Fig. 2g).Here we combined isothermal amplification with CRISPR-Cas12 DETECTR117118119120121126127128130131133134135122 technology to develop a rapid (~30 min) and low-cost test for detection of SARS-CoV-2123 in clinical samples. The use of existing qRT-PCR based assays is hindered by the need124 for expensive lab instrumentation, and availability is currently restricted to public health125 laboratories. Importantly, the DETECTR assays developed here have comparableaccuracy to qRT-PCR and are broadly accessible, as they use routine protocols andcommercially available, \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d reagents. Key advantages of our approach overexisting methods such as qRT-PCR include (1) isothermal signal amplification for rapid129 target detection obviating the need for thermocycling, (2) single nucleotide targetspecificity (guide RNAs at the N2 site can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoVand MERS-CoV), (3) integration with portable, low-cost reporting formats such as lateral132 flow strips, and (4) quick development cycle to address emerging threats from novelzoonotic viruses (<2 weeks for SARS-CoV-2, Supplementary Fig. 6).Although most of the cases of COVID-19 infection during the first month of theepidemic were traced to the city of Wuhan and Hubei province in China, the ongoing136 rise in cases now appears to be driven to local community transmission15,16. For a137number of reasons, there is an urgent public health need for rapid diagnostic tests for143 raising the possibility of environmental contamination contributing to local diseasebe screened. Viral titers in hospitalized patients can fluctuate day-to-day with lack ofcorrelation to disease severity17-19, and thus a single negative qRT-PCR test forSARSCoV-2 does not exclude infection. The virus has also been shown to be shed in stool20,outbreaks. Low testing platforms such as the DETECTR CRISPR-Cas12 assaydeveloped here may be useful for periodic repeat testing of patient samples. Clinicalvalidation of this assay in response to recent draft guidance from the US FDA7 iscurrently ongoing in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-certifiedmicrobiology laboratory.The major pandemics and large-scale epidemics of the past half century have allbeen caused by zoonotic viruses. Despite these recurrent outbreaks, we still do nothave a programmable point of care (POC) diagnostic platform that can be used topromptly address any emerging viral threat. The CRISPR-based DETECTR technologyprovides such a platform, which we have reconfigured within days to detectSARS-CoV2 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Here we developed a SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR assay,described its performance characteristics and demonstrated compatibility with lateral138SARS-CoV-2 infection. The documented cases of asymptomatic infection and139 transmission in COVID-19 patients4,5 greatly expand the pool of individuals who need to140141142144145146147148149150151152153154155157158159156 flow strips.

Briefly, viral genomes were alignedusing Clustal Omega. Next, LbCas12a target sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome were222 filtered against SARS-CoV, two bat-SARS-like-CoV genomes and common humancoronavirus genomes. Compatible target sites were finally compared to those used incurrent protocols from the CDC and WHO. LAMP primers for SARS-CoV-2 weredesigned against regions of the N-gene and E-gene using PrimerExplorer v5226 (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). RNase P POP7 primers were originally published byCurtis, et al. (2018) and a compatible gRNA was designed to function with these primersets.Target RNAs were generated from synthetic gene fragments of the viral genes of230 interest. First a PCR step was performed on the synthetic gene fragment with a forward231primer that contained a T7 promoter. Next, the PCR product was used as the template232 for an in-vitro transcription (IVT) reaction at 37\u00b0C for 2 hours. The IVT reaction was then233 treated with TURBO DNase (Thermo) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, followed by aheatdenaturation step at 75\u00b0C for 15 minutes. RNA was purified using RNA Clean andConcentrator 5 columns (Zymo Research). RNA was quantified by Nanodrop and Qubitand diluted in nuclease-free water to working concentrations.DETECTR assaysDETECTR assays were performed using RT-LAMP for pre-amplification of viralor control RNA targets and LbCas12a for the trans-cleavage assay. RT-LAMP wasprepared as suggested by New England Biolabs242 (https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/10/09/typical-rt-lamp-protocol) with a MgSO4243concentration of 6.5 mM and a final volume of 10 \u00b5L. LAMP primers were added at a244 final concentration of 0.2 \u00b5M for F3 and B3, 1.6 \u00b5M for FIP and BIP, and 0.8 \u00b5M for LFand LB. Reactions were performed independently for N-gene, E-gene, and RNase Pusing 2 \u00b5L of input RNA at 62\u00b0C for 20 minutes.LbCas12a trans-cleavage assays were performed similar to those described inChen, et al. (2018). 50 nM LbCas12a (available from NEB) was pre-incubated with 62.5nM gRNA in 1X NEBuffer 2.1 for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. After formation of the RNA-proteincomplex, the lateral flow cleavage reporter (/56-FAM/TTATTATT/3Bio/, IDT) was added251 to the reaction at a final concentration of 500 nM. RNA-protein complexes were used252 immediately or stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 24 hours before use.Lateral flow readoutAfter completion of the pre-amplification step, 2 \u00b5L of amplicon was combinedwith 18 \u00b5L of LbCas12a-gRNA complex and 80 \u00b5L of 1X NEBuffer 2.1. The 100 \u00b5LLbCas12a trans-cleavage assay was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C.A lateral flow strip (Milenia HybriDetect 1, TwistDx) was then added to the reaction tubeand a result was visualized after approximately 2-3 minutes. A single band, close to the260sample application pad indicated a negative result, whereas a single band close to the261 top of the strip or two bands indicated a positive result.Optimized DETECTR method for patient samplesmethod as described above with the following modifications: A DNA binding dye,SYTO9 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), was included in the reaction to monitor theamplification reaction and the incubation time was extended to 30 minutes to capturedata from lower titre samples.The fluorescence based patient optimized LbCas12a trans-cleavage assayswere performed as described above with modifications; 40nM LbCas12a waspre271 incubated with 40nM gRNA, after which 100nM of a fluorescent reporter molecule272compatible with detection in the presence of the SYTO9 dye273 (/5Alex594N/TTATTATT/3IAbRQSp/) was added to the complex. 2 \u00b5L of amplicon wascombined with 18 \u00b5L of LbCas12a-gRNA complex in a black 384-well assay plate andmonitored for fluorescence using a Tecan plate reader.Contrived sample preparation.In-vitro transcribed RNA (gift from California Department of Public Health279 (CDPH)), with a titer of 10,000 copies/\u00b5L (Ct value of 21) was diluted into 2,500copies/\u00b5L first, then serially diluted in water to concentration of 1 250, 625, 312, 156, 78,39, 10 and 2.5 copies per microliter.Human clinical sample collection and preparationNegative nasopharyngeal swabs were acquired from healthy donors in Chiu labwith the approval of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) IRB. Clinicalnasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of SARS-CoV-2 patients werecollected in UTM and transported to the CDPH or UCSF lab. Sample RNA ofSARSCoV-2 was extracted following instructions as described in the CDC EUA-approvedprotocol6 (input 120 \u00b5L, elution of 120 \u00b5L) using Qiagen DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit291 (Qiagen) at CDPH and the MagNA Pure 24 instrument (Roche Life Science) at UCSF.Nasopharyngeal swab samples of influenza and common coronavirus were extracted atCDC real-time qRT-PCR assayThe CDC assay was performed using the ABI 7500 Fast DX instrument (AppliedBiosystems) according the CDC EUA-approved protocol6.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES303Supplementary Figure 1.
