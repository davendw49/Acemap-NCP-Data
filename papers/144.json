Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamiccharacteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those criticalpatients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe thedynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractoryhypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune celllevels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient.Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infectionadmitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospitalin Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed andclassified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6thedition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded theepidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms andsigns, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and wedetermined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ Tcells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. NanoporeTargeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiotahomeostasis.Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that fourpatients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during thehospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expressionlevels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics wassignificantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, andthe proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such asCorynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, allpatients died.Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and theseverity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle betweenimmune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing thatimmunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype ofCOVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis maybe a high risk of fatal pneumonia.As of Feb 29, 2020, more than 80000 cases have been confirmed in China and othercountries, including South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran. This global public healthemergency is attracting most concern throughout the world.Host immune response is essential for the clearance of coronavirus infection, and thebalance between coronavirus and host immunity is key to viral pathogenesis and willultimately determine infection outcome1. Coronaviruses encode numerous viral geneproducts to evade and suppress host immune response, such as SARS-associatedcoronavirus nonstructural protein 1, which is able to inhibit host interferon-dependentantiviral signaling2, as well as another SARS coronavirus protein named open readingframe-9b, which can suppress mitochondria of immune cells3. Coronavirus suppressinghost immunity has been demonstrated, however, the alterations of immune system inpatients with COVID-2019 are not yet well understood.In this study, we aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship betweenhypoxemia severity and immune cell levels. We hope to reveal that immuno-depletioncarries a higher risk of death for COVID-2019 patients.This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted toRenmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from January 31, 2020 toFebruary 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosisand Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (7th edition) published by the NationalHealth Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographicfeatures, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcomein detail. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee ofRenmin Hospital of Wuhan University (approval number WDRY2020-K079).Nasopharyngeal-swab specimens were collected and maintained in viral-transportmedium. 2019-nCoV was confirmed by real-time fluorescent RT-PCR. Positiveconfirmatory COVID-2019 patients were defined as those with both positive tests of2019n-CoVopen reading frame 1ab (2019n-CoVORF1ab) and 2019n-Covnucleocapsid protein gene (2019n-Cov N gene). Blood samples were collected fromthree patients at different time to determine the blood routine, coagulation function,blood biochemistry and inflammation-related markers. ECG monitors were used torecord daily oximetry saturation of three patients. The lymphocyte test kit (BeckmanCoulter Inc., FL, USA) were used to analyze the lymphocyte subsets including CD3+ Tcells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and also CD16+56+ NK cells in theperiphery blood.Appendix.The methods for these procedures are conducted as described in the SupplementalCategorical variables are expressed in percentage. Continuous variables were directlyexpressed as a range. To compare the differences in the gut microbiota between patientswith health cohort which data were imported from ArumugamM's5 researchComparative analysis was conducted by two tailed T test, Data analyses wereperformed using SPSS 23.0 software. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.Three male adult patients diagnosed with COVID-2019 pneumonia were admitted toRenmin Hospital of Wuhan University on January 31, February 1 and 6, 2020 (Patient1, Patient 2, Patient 3, respectively). The mean age of these patients are 74.3 \u00b1 8.1 years.Patient 1 had a medical history of prostatic hyperplasia and Patient 3 had chronicbronchitis, while Patient 2 reported no underlying historic medical conditions. Fromthe collection of clinical features, we found that all patients reported fever and dyspnea(Table 1). Moreover, Patient 1 also had diarrhea, and Patient 3 had cough andmyalgia/fatigue additionally. Laboratory findings show that C-reactive protein (CRP)were obviously increased in all patients, and decreased lymphocyte counts andincreased procalcitonin were observed in Patient 2 and 3 (Table 1). Additionally, Patient2 also had elevated hypersensitive troponin I, creatine, and urea in serum, indicatingmyocardial injury and renal function damage. Patient 3 had increases in aspartateaminotransferase (ASL) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Table 1), which indicateliver injury. During the hospitalization, all patients received empirical antiviral andantibiotic treatment (Table 1). Patient 1 also experienced intravenous immunoglobulintherapy from day 11 of hospitalization (Table 1). Notably, three patients died on day 24,13, 12 of hospitalization, respectively.To determine the dynamic changes of different immune cells in all patients, we analyzedthe levels of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells and CD16+56+NK cells in the peripheral blood of three patients at different time points during thehospitalization. As shown in Figure 1A, Patient 1 had sustained decrease in all types ofimmune cells during the course. Specifically, CD3+, CD4, CD8+ T cells counts werealways below normal range, and CD19+ B cells count dropped below normal rangefrom day 12 and CD16+56+ NK cells count dropped below normal range from day 16.Simultaneously, Patient 1 received oxygen support through oxygen mask (5 L/min) andeven high flow oxygen (Figure 1A) due to hypoxemia. However, oximetry saturation(SaO2) were still below 95% and not recovered. On day 15, invasive mechanicalventilation was used on him due to sudden respiratory failure, while it didn\u2019t work andthe patient died at day 24. Patient 2 had sustained decrease in all types of immune cellsat the first six days below normal range (Figure 1B) and hypoxemia. Oxygen mask andhigh flow oxygen were used to correct the hypoxemia, but the SaO2 was almostdecreased along the way from day 6 (Figure 1B). Eventually, Patient 2 died at day 13.In Patient 3, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells were obviously decreased below normal rangeand CD3+, CD4+ T cells presented a sustained decline from day 4 (Figure 1C).Additionally, during the oxygen support (oxygen mask, > 5 L/min), the SaO2 of thispatient was oddly declined. From day 8, noninvasive mechanical ventilation was usedbut didn\u2019t work (Figure 1C). The patient presented a progressive and refractoryhypoxemia, and died on day 12. From these results, we found that all patients hadimmunodepletion and refractory hypoxemia. Interestingly, the phenomenon ofimmunodepletion appeared earlier than refractory hypoxemia in patients during theprogression of COVID-2019 pneumonia.Through the NTS test, we analyzed the gut microbiota at the level of phylum and genuson 3 anal swab samples from Patient 1 and Patient 3. The data of healthy humanintestinal microbiota were imported from Arumugam M's research5. The analysisresults showed that no typical pathogens detected in the two patients, such asClostridium difficile, however the structure of the gut microbiota fluctuated greatlyboth in bacteria and fungi (Table 2). Firstly, Patient 1's Actinobacteria was significantlyhigher than health cohort both in the test of two days in a row. The proportion ofActinobacteria in bacteria of patient 1 for two consecutive days are 70.7% and 44.17%,respectively. The abundance of Actinobacteria increase in patient 1 was mainlytriggered by the significant increase in Corynebacterium (77.12%, 44.67%) at the levelof genus. In addition, Kluyveromyces dominates the intestinal fungal flora of thispatient, which the proportion of fungi for 2 day are 93.4% and 99.26%. Similarly, theproportion of Firmicutes in bacterial microbiota of patient 3 is as high as 81.72% mainlybecause of the increase of Ruthenibacterium (35.12%) at the genus level, which issignificantly higher than that of health cohort (P<0.0001). At the same time, theAspergillus (59.41%) dominates the intestinal fungal flora of this patient. Overall, alldata are significantly different from healthy human gut microbiota (P <0.001).        In this study, we revealed the clinical characteristics of 3 critical patients withCOVID-2019, and found that (        The balance between virus and host immunity is closely associated with the outcomeof an infection. Clinical studies have shown that coronavirus infection severity waslinked to patient health status and an immunocompromised state carried an increasedrisk of death6, 7. It was also demonstrated that the immunosuppressed rhesus macaqueshad markedly increased MERS-Coronavirus replication in the lung, suggesting theinability in virus clearance8. Although the phenomenon of decreased lymphocytes inthe periphery blood of COVID-2019 patients has been described in the latest 7th editionof the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia published by theNational Health Commission of China9, the dynamic changes of immune cells and therelation between levels of immune cells and the severity of hypoxemia are stillunknown. Consistently, in these critical patients with COVID-2019, we found that thelower immune cell levels, the more serious hypoxia, which suggested that theimbalance between host immunity and coronavirus would lead to worse clinicaloutcome. Furthermore, evidence have identified the adverse effects of coronavirus onhost immune system10, 11. Thus, reasons of the immuno-depletion state in these criticalpatients may be associated with excessive consumption of immune cells, as well asvirus-induced immune organs injury.        Multiple studies have demonstrated the interaction between immune system and gutmicrobiota, and gut microbiota homeostasis is modulated by the immune system12. Itwas shown that a variety of immune factors was capable of altering gut microbiotahomeostasis balance, such as IL-10, IL-23, NLRP6, NOD-like receptor protein 3, andIgA13. And the imbalance or dysbiosis in gut microbiota would contribute to anenhanced mucosal permeability and thus leading to microbial translocation and asecond infection. Moreover, gut microbiota was able to modulate the immune responseand played an important role in immune-mediated diseases, suggesting a vicious circlebetween immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance14. All these findings indicatedthat the balance of gut microbiota can be disrupted in case of coronavirus infection dueto the immune disorder. In this study, we further identified the changes in gut microbiotaduring the novel coronavirus infection and found that (        Based on our findings, we suggested that the early interventions of host immunesystem and gut microbiota are necessary for COVID-2019 patients with refractoryhypoxia. For these critical patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)therapy also should be supported early to ameliorate the symptom of refractory hypoxia.In conclusion, we discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and theimbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemiaseverity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle betweenimmune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.[2017YFC1307800].This work was supported by grants from the National Key R&D Program of Chinacoronavirus evades antiviral signaling: role of nsp1 and rational design of an3.
