Among the 291 patients,15 (5.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Of 15 hospitalized patients with cardiacinjury, the median age was 65 years, and 11/15 (73.3%) were men. Underlyingcardiovascular diseases in some patients were hypertension (n=7, 46.7%), coronaryheart disease (n=3, 20%) and diabetes (n=3, 20%). The most common symptoms atillness onset in patients with cardiac injury were fever (n=11, 73.3%), cough (n=7,46.7%), headache or fatigue (n=5, 33.3%) and dyspnea (n=4, 26.7%).

Bilateral infiltrates onchest X-ray and elevated C-reactive protein occurred in all patients with cardiac injury.Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were morelikely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, and receive mechanicalventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, extracorporealmembraneoxygenation and vasopressor therapy and be admitted to the intensive care unit.123456789101112131415161718192021injuryisacommonconditionamongpatientsinfectedwith2019-nCoV.Compared with patients without cardiac injury, the clinical outcomes ofpatients with cardiac injury are relatively worse.22The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a new fatal virus that emerged at the endof 2019, remains prevalent worldwide, especially in mainland China. As of March 11,2020, at least 80969 cases have been diagnosed across mainland China, and 3162people have died secondary to infection with this virus1. Because there is no specificdrug therapy, the virus has caused public panic and great concerns globally. Althoughwe know that infection with 2019-nCoV can lead to pneumonia, acute renal injury,acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and shock, we still know little about2cardiac injury after infection with 2019-nCoV .Some viral infections are associated with cardiac injury3. Previous studies haveindicated that cardiac damage by coronavirus is relatively mild, even with the mostfatal coronaviruses, middle east respiratory syndrome and sudden acute respiratorysyndrome4, 5. However, as a new coronavirus, we do not know if 2019-nCoV isharmful to the heart; the results from current studies are inconsistent. Chinesescientists have found no obvious damage to heart tissue caused by 2019-nCoV,according to autopsy results 6; however, other studies have reported that patientsinfected with 2019-nCoV often suffered cardiac injury 7 8 9. The relationship betweencardiac injury and the risk of death among people infected with 2019-nCoV has notbeen clarified. Research is urgently needed to explore the clinical features andoutcomes of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with cardiac injury.Our study summarized the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV-infected patientswith cardiac injury to provide insight into the prevention and treatment of heart12345678910111213141516171819202122disease, in these patients.We performed a retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of confirmed coronaidentified 291 patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infections according to laboratorytesting after admission to hospital. The definitions of confirmed human infection with2019-nCoV are based on the World Health Organization interim guidelines10. Onlypatients with a laboratory-confirmed infection were included in the present analysis.This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethicscommissions of the Guangzhou Eighth people\u2019s hospital, with a waiver of informedconsent.The research team of the Department of Cardiology, Guangzhou Eighth People\u2019sHospital analysed patients\u2019 medical records. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory andradiological characteristics and treatment, and outcomes data were extracted frompatients\u2019 electronic medical records. The data were reviewed by a trained team ofdoctors in the hospital who recorded patients\u2019 demographic data, laboratory findings,exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms and treatment measures.Throat swab specimens were collected from all patients at admission, and2019-nCoV ribonucleic acid was detected by real-time polymerase chain reactionwithin 3 hours, as in a previous study. Virus detection was repeated twice every 24hours for 3 days.Cardiac injury was diagnosed if the serum levels of troponin I (TNI) were above22the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (> 0.03 \u03bcg/L) using the AccessAccuTnI+3 test (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA).The highest level of TNIwas used to evaluate the degree of myocardial injury. Unless otherwise specified, allvalues are the first data after admission, and if the index was measured more thantwice, we chose the highest value for analysis. Symptoms, ARDS and intensive careunit (ICU) admission were recorded, and we defined ARDS severity according to theinternational guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia11. Preexisting cardiacconditions were defined as congestive heart failure, diabetes, arrhythmia or ischemicheart disease and hypertension.Continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation for normallydistributed data or as median (interquartile range,IQR) for skewed distributions.Frequency data were presented as proportions. We compared continuous variablesusing Student\u2019s t test or the Mann\u2013Whitney U test when appropriate, whereasdifferences in categorical variables were assessed using the Chi-square test or Fisher\u2019sexact test.significant.All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).Statistical charts were created using GraphPad Prism 7 software (GraphPad, SanDiego, CA, USA), and a two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically22A total of 291 patients from Guangzhou Eighth People\u2019s Hospital were included in thefinal analysis, and 15/219 patients (5.2%) had cardiac injury. Patients with cardiacinjury had a higher mean age than these without cardiac injury. The median age was65 years (interquartile range, 55\u201372), and 11/15 (73.3%) were men. Patients withcardiac injury had a higher proportion of preexisting cardiac conditions such ashypertension (46.6%) and coronary heart disease (20%). The epidemiologicalcharacteristics of the study participants are presented in Table 1.2019-nCoV-infected patients with or without cardiac injury had similar symptoms.The most common symptoms at illness onset were fever (n = 11, 73.3%), cough (n =7, 46.7%), headache or fatigue (n = 5, 33.3%) and dyspnea (n = 4, 26.6%). Nopatients with cardiac injury complained of chest pain and palpitation, and the valuesfor most of the laboratory results were within the normal ranges. However, patientswith cardiac injury had higher systolic blood pressure (132 mmHg vs 124 mmHg),White blood cell count(5.6 \u00d7 109/L vs 5.2\u00d7 109/L,neutrophil count(4.1\u00d7109/L vs3.0.\u00d7109/L\uff0ctroponin I\uff080.07 ug/L vs 0.003 ug/L\uff09\uff0cbrain natriuretic peptide\uff08245.5pg/mL vs 18.5 pg/mL\uff09\uff0c D-dimer\uff08 2430 mg/L vs 1090 mg/L \uff09and lowerlymphocyte counts (1.1 \u00d7 109/L vs 1.6 \u00d7 109/L) and platelet counts (165 \u00d7 109/L vs208 \u00d7 109/L) vs patients without cardiac injury, respectively. However, in all patients22with cardiac injury, C-reactive protein levels were elevated, and patients had bilateralinfiltrates on chest X-ray. The clinical features and selected laboratory findings of thestudy participants are presented in Table 2.Complications included ARDS (20%) and severe pneumonia (73.3%), and these werecommon in patients with cardiac injury. A greater proportion of patients with cardiacinjury required tracheal cannula\uff0846.7% vs 0.4%\uff0cP<0.0001\uff09\uff0c invasive mechanicalventilation (53.3% vs 8.3%; p < 0.0001), continuous renal replacement therapy(33.3% vs 0%; p < 0.0001), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (26.7% vs 0%; p <0.0001), vasopressor therapy (20% vs 0.4%; p < 0.0001) and admission to the ICU(73.3% vs 5.4%; p < 0.0001) compared with patients without cardiac injury,respectively. One patient with cardiac injury died during the study. Treatments andoutcomes of 2019-nCoV-infected patients with cardiac injury are shown in Table 3.To our knowledge, this is one of largest studies to systematically investigate cardiacinjury in hospitalized patients with 2019-nCoV infection. In this retrospectivesingle-centre study, a small proportion (5.2%) of patients with 2019-nCoV infectionwere diagnosed with cardiac injury. Our results showed that 2019-nCoV-infectedpatients with cardiac injury had worse clinical outcomes compared with patientswithout cardiac injury.Cardiac injury is common with infections caused by influenza virus, Coxsackie22virus and other viruses, although viral-induced cardiac damage is relatively mild 3.Even the fatal coronaviruses that caused middle east respiratory syndrome and suddenacute respiratory syndrome resulted in minimal heart damage e4, 5 . 2019-nCoV is anew coronavirus, and it is unclear whether it causes serious heart damage. Recentstudies have yielded inconsistent results. Xu et al found that there was no obviousheart damage in autopsy examinations of patients with 2019-nCoV-inducedpneumonia6. However, other studies found that patients with 2019-nCoV-inducedpneumonia also developed cardiac injury 7 8 9. To ensure the accuracy of our cardiacinjury evaluation, we chose TNI as the only evaluation index. As a gold standard toevaluate cardiac injury, TNI is more accurate than creatine kinase-MB andelectrocardiography. Our study found that a small proportion of 2019-nCoV-infectedpatients (5.2%) developed cardiac injury, which is a lower rate than in previousstudies 9. This result may be related to using TNI as the only evaluation index in thisstudy.2019-nCoV-infected patients with cardiac injury in our study were usually older(median age: 62 y) and often had pre-existing heart disease (hypertension, coronaryheart disease). Furthermore, older patients with chronic disease are more likely to becritically ill 9. Our results showed that patients with a history of heart disease are atincreased risk of serious illness or death if they are infected with 2019-nCoV.The mechanism of cardiac injury in patients infected with 2019-nCoV is unclear.In a recent study, autopsy examinations failed to detect 2019-nCoV in heart tissue,and the authors found no other substantial damage to the heart tissue 6. However,increased numbers of studies have indicated an association between 2019-nCoV22infection and cardiac injury, 12. To explain these inconsistencies, severe infection,hypoxia and mechanical ventilation settings may be associated with cardiac injury,and these common conditions in patients infected with 2019-nCoV may partly explainthe heart damage. It is also very possible that the viral invasion of 2019-nCoV to theheart does not occur directly, but indirectly, via the inflammatory response. Severe2019-nCoV infection may trigger an exaggerated immune response. This finding wasconfirmed by autopsy results 6, which showed that overactivation of T cells accounts,in part, for the severe immune injury. Another study showed that 2019-nCoV-infectedpatients admitted to the ICU have higher cytokine levels (interleukin 2, interleukin 7and other cytokines) compared with patients not admitted to the ICU 13. According tothese findings, we hypothesize that 2019-nCoV may promote cardiac injury by aninflammatory reaction, but this hypothesis must be explored further.Our study showed that during COVID-19 epidemics, cardiac injury wasassociated with clinical outcomes for 2019-nCoV -infected patients. The proportion ofpatients requiring non-invasive ventilator support and extracorporeal membraneoxygen, admission to ICU and developing ARDS was significantly higher in patientswith cardiac injury compared with patients without cardiac injury. Cardiac injury is apotential indicator of risk stratification for 2019-nCoV-infected patients.There are several limitations in our study. First, this study was a single-centre studyinvolving a small number of patients, and evaluating more medical records is neededto support our conclusions. Second, because our patients were from Guangzhou City,22only, different clinical features of patients with heart injury from other geographicareas may be found in future studies. Third, of the 291 patients, some were stillhospitalized at submission of this manuscript. Therefore, it is difficult to assesspatients\u2019 long-term prognosis, and it is necessary to continue to observe the naturalhistory of the disease.2019-nCoV.Compared with patients without cardiac injury, the clinical outcomes ofpatients with cardiac injury are relatively worse. Cardiac injury is a potentialprognostic risk indicator for patients infected with 2019-nCoV.The authors had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility forthe integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
