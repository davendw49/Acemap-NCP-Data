CORONAVIRUSES: SARS-COVAND MERS-COVSince the identification of the firstcoronavirus \u2013 infectious bronchitis virus(IBV) isolated from birds [        Coronaviruses occasionally jumpacross host barriers, often with lethalconsequences. eTh alpha- andbetacoronaviruses only infect mammalsand usually cause respiratory illness inhumans and gastroenteritis in animals.Gamma- and deltacoronaviruses mainlyinfect birds, and no human infectionhas been reported. Six coronavirusesknown to infect humans are 229E,NL63 (genus Alpha-), OC43, HKU1,SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Beta-),whereas only SARS- and MERS-CoVhave caused large worldwide outbreakswith fatality, others usually cause mildupper-respiratory tract illnesses. Anovel coronavirus was identified in apneumonia patient in Wuhan on January9 of this year represents the seventhhuman-infecting coronaviruses.        Severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS, induced by SARS-CoV) firstemerged in Guangdong province, Chinain 2002 [                BAT ORIGIN OF PATHOGENICCORONAVIRUSESBats are notorious for carrying manyemerging or re-emerging viruses.Epidemiological investigations have shownthat almost all SARS patients have ahistory of animal exposure prior to thedisease. SARS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoVantibodies were first found in the maskedpalm civet (Paguma larvata) [                Viruses isolated from MERS patientswere found to have close contact withdromedary camels, suggesting the animalorigin [                It is worthy of notice that in 2016swine acute diarrhea syndrome wasfound in Guangdong province, China,with a mortality up to 90% for piglets.hTe causative pathogen was identifiedas a new coronavirus, called swine acutediarrhea syndrome coronavirus(SADSCoV), shared 95% genomic identitywith bat alphacoronavirus HKU2 [                Several genome sequences of the2019-nCoV have been released in thehtp://virological.org/ and GlobalInitiative on Sharing All Influenza Data(GISAID) database (htps://www.gisaid.org), by the Chinese Center forDisease Control and Prevention andothers. Early published studies showedthat the 2019-nCoV had 96.2%similarity to a bat betacoronavirus [        A simplified phylogeny is shown inFig. 1 to illustrate the position of2019nCoV in the genus Betacoronavirus, basedon the published genetic background?DPP4DPP4DPP4?ACE2?ACE2ACE2ACE2SARS-CoV-2        MERS-CoVand phylogenetics for purposes of clarity[                EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISMLEADING TO NEW VIRUSESSimilar to SARS-CoV at the early stage[        Host restrictionCross species transmissionSADS-CoVRecombinantsIntermediatehostsEnd hosts        Recombination of viruses occurswhen two diferent parent virusescoinfect the same host cell and interactduring replication, generatingdescendant viruses that have genes from bothparental viruses. Recombination hasoften been associated with the expansionof the host range, increases in virulence,the evasion of host immune system andthe evolution of resistance to antiviraltreatments [                Given the high prevalence of diverseSARSr-CoVs and MERSr-CoVscarried by diferent animals, and frequentcontact histories revealed by peopleinfected with the animal viruses, asproposed in a widely accepted hypothesis(Fig. 2) on the generation andcrossspecies transmission of the pathogeniccoronaviruses [                Frequent human-animal contact is themajor cause for viral cross-speciestransmission.
