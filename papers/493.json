Thecollege president, Dr Harry Nespolon,made the appeal because of theshortage of protective masks availableto health-care workers due to therecent bushfire crisis engulfing thecountry.\u201cThis week I urged Federal HealthMinister Greg Hunt to make theemergency medical mask stockpileavailable to GP clinics\u201d, Nespolon toldThe Lancet Respiratory Medicine. \u201cIt isgreat news that the Government hasheeded that advice and acted swiftly tomake these masks available to clinicsnationwide, including those afectedby the bushfires.\u201dThe masks will be available to bothfrontline staf in clinics and patientssuspected of having symptoms of2019-nCoV infection. \u201cThe maskswon\u2019t have to be worn routinely,instead GPs and staff should makesensible decisions about when to wearthem\u201d, says Nespolon. \u201cThe RACGP hassuggested patients should call aheadto clinics and warn of their symptomsif they have been in China or had closecontact with someone who has beenin China. In those circumstances itwould make sense to wear the maskswhen the person presents for theirconsultation.\u201dThe masks made available are theN95 respirator type, which prevent95% of small particles, includingpathogens from entering the nose andmouth. \u201cI would recommend to all GPsand clinic staf that they make full useof their personal protective equipment,wash their hands as often as possible, Tony Kirbyand ask if patients showing symptomsof coronavirus have travelled recently,and if so, where. It\u2019s also worth askingif they have had contact with someonewho has been in China.\u201dAn Australian Federal HealthDepartment spokesperson confirmedto The Lancet Respiratory Medicinethat the first 500 000 masks hadalready been delivered to primaryhealth networks across all states andterritories, with a further 500 000 tobe made available if required. \u201cThesemasks are not for distribution to thegeneral public but rather to GPs, healthworkers, and high-risk patients\u201d,he added.
