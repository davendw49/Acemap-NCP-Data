Here we discuss the clinical outcomesof corticosteroid use in coronavirus and similar outbreaks(table).Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distresssyndrome are partly caused by host immune responses.Corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation but alsoinhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance.In SARS-CoV infection, as with influenza, systemicinflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. 12In SARS, inflammation persists after viral clearance.13,14Pulmonary histology in both SARS and MERS infectionsreveals inflammation and difuse alveolar damage, 15with one report suggesting haemophagocytosis.16Theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a roleto suppress lung inflammation.In a retrospective observational study reportingon 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS,2almost half of patients (151 [49%]) were givencorticosteroids (median hydrocortisone equivalentdose [ie, methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25,prednisolone 1:4] of 300 mg/day). Patients who weregiven corticosteroids were more likely to requiremechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renalreplacement therapy. After statistical adjustmentfor immortal time and indication biases, the authorsconcluded that administration of corticosteroids wasnot associated with a diference in 90-day mortality(adjusted odds ratio 0\u00b78, 95% CI 0\u00b75\u20131\u00b71; p=0\u00b712) butwas associated with delayed clearance of viral RNAfrom respiratory tract secretions (adjusted hazardratio 0\u00b74, 95% CI 0\u00b72\u20130\u00b77; p=0\u00b70005). However, theseefect estimates have a high risk of error due to theprobable presence of unmeasured confounders.In a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patientswith SARS, only four studies provided conclusive data,all indicating harm.1 The first was a case-control studyof SARS patients with (n=15) and without (n=30)SARS-related psychosis; all were given corticosteroidtreatment, but those who developed psychosis weregiven a higher cumulative dose than those who did not(10 975 mg hydrocortisone equivalent vs 6780 mg;p=0\u00b7017).6 The second was a randomised controlled trialof 16 patients with SARS who were not critically ill; thenine patients who were given hydrocortisone (mean4\u00b78 days [95% CI 4\u00b71\u20135\u00b75] since fever onset) had greaterviraemia in the second and third weeks after infectionthan those who were given 0\u00b79% saline control.5 Theremaining two studies reported diabetes and avascularnecrosis as complications associated with corticosteroidtreatment.7,8A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis9identiefid ten observational studies in inuflenza, with a totalof 6548 patients. The investigators found increasedmortality in patients who were given corticosteroids(risk ratio [RR] 1\u00b775, 95% CI 1\u00b73\u20132\u00b74; p=0\u00b70002). Amongother outcomes, length of stay in an intensive care unitwas increased (mean diefrence 2\u00b7 1, 95% CI 1\u00b72\u20133\u00b71;p<0\u00b70001), as was the rate of secondary bacterial orfungal infection (RR 2\u00b70, 95% CI 1\u00b70\u20133\u00b78; p=0\u00b704).Corticosteroids have been investigated for respiratorysyncytial virus (RSV) in clinical trials in children, withno conclusive evidence of benefit and are therefore notrecommended.10 An observational study of 50 adultswith RSV infection, in which 33 (66%) were givencorticosteroids, suggested impaired antibody responsesClark D Russell, Jonathan E Millar,*J Kenneth Baillieat 28 days in those given corticosteroids.17Life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndromeoccurs in 2019-nCoV infection.18 However, generalisingevidence fromacute respiratory distress syndromestudies to viral lung injury is problematic becausethese trials typically include a majority of patients withacute respiratory distress syndrome of non-pulmonaryor sterile cause. A review of treatments for acuterespiratory distress syndrome of any cause, based onsix studies with a total of 574 patients,19 concluded thatinsuficient evidence exists to recommend corticosteroidtreatment.20Septic shock has been reported in seven (5%) of140 patients with 2019-nCoV included in publishedreports as of Jan29, 2020.3,18 Corticosteroids arewidely used in septic shock despite uncertainty overtheir eficacy. Most patients in septic shock trialshave bacterial infection, leading to vasoplegic shockandmyocardial insuficiency. 21,22 In this group, thereis potential that net benefit might be derived fromsteroid treatment in severe shock.21,22 However, shockin severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure is often aconsequence of increased intrathoracic pressure (duringinvasive ventilation) impeding cardiac filling, and notvasoplegia.23 In this context, steroid treatment is unlikelyto provide a benefit.No clinical data exist to indicate that net benefitis derived from corticosteroids in the treatment ofrespiratory infection due to RSV, influenza, SARS-CoV,or MERS-CoV. The available observational data suggestincreasedmortalityandsecondary infection ratesin influenza, impaired clearance of SARS-CoV andMERS-CoV, and complications of corticosteroid therapyin survivors. If it is present, the efect of steroids onmortality in those with septic shock is small, and isunlikely to be generalisable to shock in the context ofsevere respiratory failure due to 2019-nCoV.Overall, no unique reason exists to expect thatpatients with 2019-nCoV infection will benetfi fromcorticosteroids, and theymight bemore likely tobe harmed with such treatment. We conclude thatcorticosteroid treatment should not be used for thetreatment of 2019-nCoV-induced lung injury or shockoutside of a clinical trial.JKB is a member of the WHO panel on clinical management for 2019-nCoV.CDR and JEM declare no competing interests.123456789Stockman LJ, Bellamy R, Garner P.
