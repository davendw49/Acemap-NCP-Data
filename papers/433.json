Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.", "text": "and parsed to 29 unique RBD sequences, representing all published absence of the host protease or incompatibility between the hostvariations of the lineage B RBD (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b).

Thus, the results shownare representative of the biological replicates we observed. Four separate cloneswere recovered in parallel for the SARS\u2013SARS-CoV-2 construct and were testedsimultaneously, in triplicate.

The pATX-based VSV plasmid was used to generate a dual-reporterplasmid17. First, the coding sequence for enhanced green fluorescent protein was PCRamplified and inserted into the vector via XhoI and NheI. Firefly luciferase was PCRamplified and inserted into the vector via MluI and AvrII. This plasmid was then usedto generate the replication-incompetent VSV particles, as previously described.The spike coding sequences for SARS-CoV Urbani, As6526 and BM48-31were codon optimized for human cells, then appended with a 5\u2032 kozak expressionsequence (GCCACC) and 3\u2032 tetra-glycine linker followed by nucleotides encodinga FLAG-tag sequence (DYKDDDDK). For SARS-CoV spike, silent mutationswere introduced around codons 308 and 519 to form KpnI and XhoI digest sites.For As6526 spike, silent mutations were introduced around codons 290 and 501to form AflII and HindIII digest sites. For BM48-31 spike, silent mutations wereintroduced around codons 295 and 501 to form AflII and HindIII digest sites.Reporting Summary.

For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settingsFor hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomesEstimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculatedOur web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). Policy information about availability of dataAll manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable:- Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets- A list of figures that have associated raw data- A description of any restrictions on data availabilityAccession numbers for all viral sequences used in this study are provided in extended data figure 1b. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection. Sample sizeData exclusionsReplicationRandomizationBlindingSample-size calculations were not performed. The figures in our manuscript are \"final\" experiments after many months of preliminary data collection. All viral pseudotypes in our studywere generated and tested multiple times before we produced large batches of pseudotypes for the \"final\" experiments. This is because the generally binary outcome of the assay performed leftresults to little interpretation.
