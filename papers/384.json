China, has spread to 29 mainland provinces, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, as well as 11 othercountries (1, 2). Early genome sequence and clinical studies of 2019-nCoV provided theevidence of human-to-human transmission and revealed its similarity to as well as differencesfrom SARS (3-5). However, epidemiological investigations of 2019-nCoV are justbeginning, and data-driven studies are critically needed to develop insights into this ongoingoutbreak and evaluate the effectiveness of public health strategies, such as the currentlyimplemented lockdown of Wuhan.An important epidemiological understanding of 2019-nCoV is concerned with itstransmissibility, quantified by the basic reproduction number  0 and the effectivereproduction number  .  0 is the expected number of secondary infectious cases generatedby an infectious case in a susceptible population.  is the expected number of secondarycases generated by an infectious case once an epidemic is underway (6).  =  0 , where  \u2208(0, 1) is the proportion of the population susceptible. Following (7),  is calculated asfollows:2 =  ( \u00d7  ) +  ( +  ) + 1,where  is the average latent period,  the average latent infectious period,  the logarithmicgrowth rate of the case counts as reported by China CDC. This form of  is appropriatebecause 2019-nCoV is still at its early growth stage. According to China CDC, we set  = 7days and  = 9 days. Experiments with varying  and  values were also conducted.505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273Let  denote the number of days since the start of the outbreak and  ( ) the number ofcases.  is estimated based on  ( ) at six time points. (Time-1) 12/31/2019, when theauthorities reported the first 27 cases with the infection dated as early as 12/16/2019. Assignificant changes experienced in this time period in the case reporting requirements andpractice.Using the data described above,  is estimated to be 4.08, indicating that an infectedpatient infects more than four susceptible people during the outbreak. This value substantiallyexceeds WHO's estimate of  0 (supposed to be smaller than  ) between 1.4 and 2.5, and isalso higher than a recent  0 estimate between 3.6 and 4.0 (8). Compared against the 2003SARS epidemic,  of 2019-nCoV is higher than that of SARS in both Beijing (2.76) andGuangzhou (3.01) (calculated using the same method). To test the robustness of findings, weperformed sensitivity analyses by adopting varying values of  and  , generated from aGaussian distribution with ~(7,1)and ~(9,1). The resulting mean of R estimates is4.08, as expected, with SD=0.36 (95% CI 3.37~4.77).To predict the future outbreak profile, we developed a model based on thedeterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Death-Cumulative (SEIRDC)structure (9). Overall, our model appears to explain the reported case counts very well duringthe current early stage of the outbreak. An interesting finding is that by setting the start datethe SEIRDC model is able to provide a better fit for the case counts. This indicates thathuman-to-human transmission may have started earlier than what the current prevailing757677787980818283848586878889909192939495969798the resulting viewpoint suggests. Obviously, further molecular and epidemiological studies are needed todraw any conclusions in this regard.        The SEIRDC model estimates                Our study also suggests that by reducing the average infectious period to <2.3 days,will decease to a value less than 1, meaning the epidemic can be effectivelyIn conclusion, considering transmissibility and fatality rate, 2019-nCoV poses a majorpublic health threat, at least at the level of 2003 SARS.
