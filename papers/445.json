Furthermore, it can degradeamino acids anaerobically throughsymbiotic interspecies formate andhydrogen transfer with its syntrophicpartner.These results led the authors topropose one potential route ofeukaryogenesis, in which an oxygen\u00adconsuming bacterium became entan\u00adgled in the extracellular protrusionsof an Asgard archaeon, which lived ina syntrophic relationship with a thirdpartner, a sulfate\u00adreducing bacterium.They further suggest that the Asgardarchaeon then engulfed and endo\u00adgenized the future mitochondrion,which helped the Asgard archaeonto adapt to and exploit rising oxygenlevels in the environment.The isolation of \u2018Ca. Prometheo\u00adarchaeum syntrophicum\u2019 sets the stagefor further exploration of the origin ofeukaryotes.Ursula\u00a0HoferSince mid\u00adDecember 2019, several cases of a pneumonia\u00adlike disease (with symptoms including fever, difficultyin breathing, cough and invasive lesions on both lungs)of unknown cause have emerged in the central Chinesecity of Wuhan (WHo ). Chinese authorities made apreliminary determination that the causative agent isa novel coronavirus (2019\u00adnCov), and other respiratorypathogens have been ruled out as the cause (WHo ).A consortium of researchers, government agencies andinstitutes released six sequences of the coronavirusassociated with the outbreak in Wuhan on virological.organd on Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data(GISAID). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the newvirus clusters with the severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS)\u00adrelated coronavirus clade, and the virus has sincebeen isolated.So far ~400 confirmed infections with the new coronavirusas well as several deaths have been reported in China (Nature),although scientists at Imperial College in london estimatedthat the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be closerto 1,700. In addition, the virus has spread to Thailand, Japan,South Korea and the united States, and additional casesin other countries are likely.Coronaviruses comprise a large family of viruses thatcause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals andhumans, including middle east respiratory syndrome (meRS)and SARS. SARS first emerged in the Guangdong province,China, causing the 2002\u20132003 epidemic. The virus spreadrapidly among humans, affecting ~8,000 individuals in morethan 30 countries and causing the death of ~800 patients.SARS and meRS coronaviruses likely originated in bats andhave been transmitted directly to humans from market civetsand dromedary camels.on the basis of initial epidemiological investigations,the pneumonia\u00adlike cases in Wuhan have been linkedto a seafood and animal market, which might point toa zoonotic origin of the new coronavirus (CDC). The markethas since been closed for environmental sanitation anddisinfection, and environmental specimens from thatand other markets are being collected and tested.The u n health agency has urged China to continue theefforts to identify the source, reservoirs and possibleintermediate hosts of the new virus. The Wuhan HealthCommission reported that \u201cthe possibility of limitedhuman\u00adto\u00adhuman transmission cannot be ruled out\u201d andinfections of the health\u00adcare workers as well as infectionsof family members suggest that person\u00adto\u00adperson spreadis occurring (Nature).Response measures have been implemented inWuhan, and ongoing investigations are focussing onunderstanding the epidemiology, the source, clinicalmanifestation, transmission routes, global risk assessmentand the development of diagnostic tests (Science; WHo ).The WHo has called a meeting to decide whether todeclare a public\u00adhealth emergency of internationalconcern (The Washington Post).Andrea\u00a0Du\u00a0Toit", "ref_list": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "vesiculation affects the dynamics\nof surface modulation; that is,\nremoval of OmpT and accumulation\nof glycine-modified lipid A.
