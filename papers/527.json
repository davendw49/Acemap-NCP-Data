OBJECTIVE To identify evidence and narrative-based practices that promote clinician presence, a state of awareness, focus, and attention with the intent to understand patients. EVIDENCE REVIEW Preliminary practices were derived through a systematic literature review (from January 1997 to August 2017, with a subsequent bridge search to September 2019) of effective interpersonal interventions; observations of primary care encounters in 3 diverse clinics (n = 27 encounters); and qualitative interviews with physicians (n = 10), patients (n = 27), and nonmedical professionals whose occupations involve intense interpersonal interactions (eg, firefighter, chaplain, social worker; n = 30). After evidence synthesis, promising practices were reviewed in a 3-round modified Delphi process by a panel of 14 researchers, clinicians, patients, caregivers, and health system leaders. Panelists rated each practice using 9-point Likert scales (\u22124 to +4) that reflected the potential effect on patient and clinician experience and feasibility of implementation; after the third round, panelists selected their \u201ctop 5\u201d practices from among those with median ratings of at least +2 for all 3 criteria. Final recommendations incorporate elements from all highly rated practices and emphasize the practices with the greatest number of panelist votes. FINDINGS The systematic literature review (n = 73 studies) and qualitative research activities yielded 31 preliminary practices. Following evidence synthesis, 13 distinct practices were reviewed by the Delphi panel, 8 of which met criteria for inclusion and were combined into a final set of 5 recommendations: (1) prepare with intention (take a moment to prepare and focus before greeting a patient); (2) listen intently and completely (sit down, lean forward, avoid interruptions); (3) agree on what matters most (find out what the patient cares about and incorporate these priorities into the visit agenda); (4) connect with the patient's story (consider life circumstances that influence the patient's health; acknowledge positive efforts; celebrate successes); and (5) explore emotional cues (notice, name, and validate the patient's emotions).", "type": "Special Communication", "text": "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This mixed-methods study identified 5 practices that have thepotential to enhance physician presence and meaningful connection with patients in theclinical encounter. Evaluation and validation of the outcomes associated with implementingthe 5 practices is needed, along with system-level interventions to create a supportiveenvironment for implementation.S disease treatment and care delivery, but these sameadcientific and technological advances have greatly improvedvances have contributed to physician and patientdissatisfaction. In attempts to personalize health care, the delivery of carehas become more impersonal.1 A patient\u2019s need to connect and aphysician\u2019s need to find meaning through connection are frustrated byan intrusive electronic health record, brief visits, andadministrative demands. This mismatch of time and expectations isassociated with physician frustration, emotional exhaustion, and \u201cburnout\u201drates that affect many clinicians.2,3The word presence refers to a purposeful practice ofawareness, focus, and attention with the intent to understand andconnect with patients.4,5 The interpersonal interactions of clinical caregive physicians insight that cannot be garnered from an electronichealth record. This gathering of nuanced, personal data (eg, whatis important to a patient; how a patient\u2019s symptoms affect her or hislife, goals, and preferences for treatment) cultivates respect and trustbetween patients and physicians and can reduce themiscommunication and oversight that leads to medical error.The objective of this study was to identify evidence-basedpractices that foster this time-honored ritual between physicians andpatients to create connection, particularly in the first moments of aclinical encounter. To ensure that these measures are useful and easilyimplemented, the study focused on specific actions, behaviors, andcommunication strategies that clinicians could easily adopt andutilize in a busy clinical practice.We derived a preliminary set of presence practices throughformative research that included a systematic literature review ofeffective interpersonal interventions; clinical observations of diverseprimary care encounters; and qualitative interviews with primary carephysicians, patients, and nonmedical professionals whoseoccupations involve intense interpersonal interactions (ie, individuals whowork with clients or other service recipients under time-pressuredor stressful conditions). We then conducted a 3-round modifiedtives on the patient-physician relationship to identify a final set ofcore practices.The research team conducted a systematic literature review of themedical and social sciences literature to identify evidence-basedinterpersonal interventions that could form the basis for presencepractices. As previously described,7 we searched PubMed,EMBASE, and PsycInfo (January 1997 to August 2017) forrandomized controlled trials and controlled observational studies thatexamined the association between patient-clinician interpersonalinterventions and included at least 1 outcome measure of the\u201cquadruple aim\u201d (ie, patient health outcomes, patient experience,clinician experience, or cost).8Using the Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd) onlinesystematic review tool, 2 trained independent investigatorsabstracted information about intervention content, structure, andstudy design quality and methods from each article. A thirdinvestigator reviewed abstracted data and resolved discrepancies.Abstracted data included intervention focus (ie, motivationalinterviewing, health literacy, patient-physician relationship,patientcentered care, communication skills, shared decision-making,communication technique, psychological/therapeutic interview,mindfulness), intervention structure (ie, education, practice,instructions, tool), demand on clinician (time and effortrequirements), target of intervention (ie, clinician, clinician and patient),and outcome effect size and significance. Study design qualitywas assessed using the Cochrane criteria for grading randomizedcontrolled trials and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Carefor controlled observational studies; the level of evidence wasassessed using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria.A multidisciplinary team of primary care physicians and researcherswith expertise in linguistics, health communication, and publichealth synthesized findings to identify interpersonal interventionsassociated with positive outcomes across the quadruple aim.eAppendix 1 in the Supplement includes a full description of studycriteria, search terms, and abstraction methods. A bridge search wascompleted in September 2019 to identify additional articles thatmet search criteria.            Clinical Observations and Interviews With Physiciansand PatientsTo supplement literature-based findings about practices that fosterphysician presence and connection with patients, team membersobserved and analyzed 27 physician-patient interactions in 3diverse primary care settings: an academic medical center (n = 10),a Veterans Affairs facility (n = 7), and a federally qualified healthcenter (n = 10). At each site, we used convenience sampling toselect 2 to 5 internal medicine or family medicine physicians who(            Guided by human-centered design theory,10,11 researchers trainedin qualitative methods conducted and analyzed interviews with30 professionals outside the field of clinical medicine whose jobsinvolve relational care and intense interpersonal interactions. Theobjectives of these interviews, described previously,12 were tolearn from analogous experiences and to identify cross-disciplinarypractices that foster human connection and might haveapplications in medicine. Convenience sampling was used to identify 3 to 5individuals from each of 7 categories of profession13: management;business/finance; community and social service; educationalinstruction; arts, design, entertainment, and media; protectiveservices; and personal care and service occupations. Recruitmentcontinued until we obtained a sample stratified by profession categoryand achieved data saturation. Interviews were anonymous andcoded by professional role; this component of the study receivedan exemption from the Stanford University institutional reviewboard (IRB 43314). Additional details about the interview methods,procedures, and analysis are presented in eAppendix 3 in theSupplement.            Through the literature review and complementary qualitativeresearch activities, a list of 31 potential practices was generatedthat contribute to clinician presence and connections withpatients (eAppendix 4 in the Supplement). The research teammet weekly and held 2 half-day workshops over a 2-month periodto review the evidence for each practice. During this time, theteam (                        Following evidence synthesis activities, we used a modified Delphiprocess\u2014a validated method for quantifying expert opinion6\u2014torevise and finalize a list of recommended presence practices. A fulldescription of the Delphi methods is available in eAppendix 5 in theSupplement. The panelists (n = 14; not otherwise affiliated with theproject) were chosen to represent diverse sociodemographicgroups, disciplines, geographies, and practice settings. Individualpanelists included physicians, a nurse, health system leaders,patient and caregiver advocates, and researchers with expertise inphysician communication and behavior, implementation ofphysician-patient interpersonal interventions, and medicaleducation. The Delphi panel was facilitated by an experienced nonvotingDelphi moderator and had 3 rounds: (                        After each round of the Delphi, panelists rated each practiceusing 3 criteria: (            From 21 838 references initially identified, 73 studies met inclusioncriteria (eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). A majority (92%) of thestudies were level 1 according to the Oxford Levels of Evidence,indicating the highest-quality research; 29 (40%) were from theUnited States and 44 (60%) were international; 67 (92%) wererandomized controlled trials and 6 (8%) were controlledobservational studies. More than half of the studies (52%) reported at least1 health outcome, 74% reported at least 1 patient experienceoutcome, 37% reported at least 1 clinician experience outcome, and26% reported costs or cost-relevant outcomes. The most commonfocus areas of the interventions were interpersonal communicationskills (29%) and specific communication techniques (22%). Fewerinterventions focused on patient-centered care (19%),motivational interviewing (8%), shared decision-making (7%), healthliteracy (4%), patient-physician relationship (4%), mindfulness (4%),and psychological/therapeutic interviewing (3%). Specific studiesthat provided support for the final recommended practices aredescribed in eAppendix 6 in the Supplement.Clinical Observations and Interviews With Physiciansand PatientsObserved clinicians represented diversity in gender (5 men and 5women) and race/ethnicity (50% Asian, 10% Hispanic/Latino,72jama.comand 10% African American/black). Observed patients (n = 27) hada mean age of 58 years (SD, 17 years; range, 20-90 years); 16identified as male, 11 as female; and the majority were nonwhite(30% Hispanic/Latino, 22% Asian, and 15% African American/black). Nineteen percent reported speaking a second language athome (Hindu, Arabic, Tamil, Ilocano); an additional 26% wereexclusively or primarily Spanish speaking. Some examples ofpractices that were observed or discussed in interviews includechecking in and exploring patient concerns (eg, \u201cDoes that makesense?\u201d), statements conveying empathy and validation (\u201cI know,man, it\u2019s so true\u201d; \u201cSounds like \u2026\u201d), indications of partnership(eg, \u201cLet\u2019s look at this together\u201d), nonverbal communication (eg,clinician turned swivel chair toward patient while listening topatient\u2019s primary concern), and complimenting patient effortsand ideas (eg, \u201cKeep on doing what you\u2019re doing!\u201d). Additionalfindings from the clinical observations and interviews arepresented in eAppendix 2 and eAppendix 6 in the Supplement.Nonmedical professionals (n = 30) were well balanced in terms ofgender (53% male and 47% female) and race/ethnicity (5 Asian,2 Latino, 2 Middle Eastern, and 1 Pacific Islander). Representationacross professional domain and specific roles are presented ineAppendix 3. Cross-professional themes around presence andhuman connection included trust building (\u201cIt comes through thebuilding of relationships and the building of your credibility \u2026through actions, through words\u201d\u2014school principal), nonverbalcommunication and silence (\u201cI use a lot of silence \u2026 sometimesI back away physically from people if I see they can\u2019t make eyecontact with me\u201d\u2014chaplain), adopting mindfulness approaches(\u201c[I remind myself] \u2018Why are you here? Why did you sign on thedotted line?\u2019 \u2026 At the end of the day, it\u2019s about the people I\u2019mserving\u201d\u2014fire captain), and connecting on an emotional level(\u201cUsually if I let myself be carried along by someone\u2019s story, I findthat it pushes them to say more\u201d\u2014documentary filmmaker).Additional findings from these interviews are included in eAppendix 3in the Supplement.Evidence synthesis narrowed the 31 preliminary practices to 18practices across 5 domains: clinician introspection and mindfulnessactivities, practices that help a clinician prepare for and personalizea visit, practices that involve nonverbal connection, activities thatelicit the patient\u2019s perspective, and practices related to partnership.After additional evidence review, this list was narrowed to 13discrete practices with promising support from the systematicliterature review, qualitative research findings, and supplementaryreview of supporting literature (Figure 1). eAppendix 4 in theSupplement provides additional details about the evidencesynthesis process and findings.The 14 Delphi panelists included 8 physicians, 1 patient advocate,1 caregiver advocate, and 2 health system leaders; researchexpertise included medical education/bedside medicine (n = 7), healthcare delivery innovation (n = 7), implementation of clinicalinterventions (n = 3), health care and clinical communication (n = 9),diversity/health disparities (n = 4), and psychology/behaviorchange (n = 4). eAppendix 5 in the Supplement provides additionaldetails about the Delphi panel demographand procedures.Delphi panel ratings are presented in Table 1; qualitativefeedback is presented in eAppendix 5 in the Supplement. In the first roundof the Delphi panel, 3 of the 13 preliminary practices receivedmedian ratings of 2 or higher (positioning oneself, stopping andlistening, asking \u201cWhat\u2019s important to you?\u201d). All practices were revisedin response to quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback, and inthe second round, 2 additional practices met threshold ratings(collaborative agenda setting and focusing on progress). Prior to the thirdpanel, 2 practices that had received consistently low ratings wereeliminated (emphasizing joint responsibility and recognizing thepower of touch), and others were incorporated into practices withsimilar principles (eg, sharing the screen was integrated intopositioning oneself). Eight practices were reviewed in the third round,only 5 of which had been significantly altered and were thereforererated. The practices that received the greatest number of \u201ctop 5\u201dvotes were honoring emotions (100%), coming prepared (86%),listening without interrupting (86%), and eliciting and addressingpatient priorities (79%). Practices with fewer \u201ctop 5\u201d votes (taking amoment [43%], positioning oneself [43%], focusing on thepositive [36%], and walking in the patient\u2019s shoes [29%]) werecombined and/or incorporated into the higher-ranking practices. Thefinal practices were renamed based on discussion with Delphi panelistsand project advisors.Five Recommended Practices to Foster Presenceand Meaningful Connection With PatientsStudy activities yielded 5 recommended practices to fosterpresence and meaningful connections with patients\u2014the \u201cPresence 5Practices\u201d (Figure 2). Below, each practice is summarized, along withexamples and supporting evidence from the formative researchactivities and Delphi panel. Illustrative quotes from physicians,nonmedical professionals, and Delphi panelists are presented in Table 2.A detailed description of each practice and supporting evidence ispresented in eAppendix 6 in the Supplement.

Specific practices anchored toroutine tasks, such as handwashing (which in some religiousrituals is a moment of centering),19 might remind physicians thatthey are entering hallowed space, allowing them to beintentional; some might instead take 3 deep breaths before walkinginto the examination room.20-22 These practices have beenstudied most frequently in the context of mindfulness-based stressreduction and physician wellness. A recent systematic review of81 articles found that mindfulness interventions were associatedwith improvements in clinicians\u2019 anxiety, depression, and stress.23Brief breathing and mindfulness exercises have also beenincorporated into more complex interventions that improve physicianwell-being and experiences with difficult visits.20,22 Although amindfulness-oriented practice might not appeal to all clinicians,experts generally agreed that it requires minimal training, is easyto implement in varied and busy clinical settings, and can betailored per personal preference.          This practice also incorporates 2 components: (          The second key component of this practice is to avoidinterrupting a patient, particularly during the patient\u2019s openingdescription of active health issues.38-40 Research has shown that, onaverage, physicians interrupt their patients within 11 seconds.41 Whenphysicians listen attentively and avoid interruptions during openingmonologues, patients communicate more, provide more medicalinformation, and report greater satisfaction.42,43 The practice canbe extended throughout the visit by using silence and \u201cinfrequent,timely, and considered questions\u201d when the patient is telling his orher story.44 When incorporated into complex communicationinterventions, listening without interruption can reduce patient painand anxiety39 and does not substantially extend visit time.38,40,43Using silence can also reduce the incidence of \u201cdoorknobsyndrome,\u201d ie, when a patient raises new concerns at the very end ofthe visit.45 In terms of implementation, this practice requiresminimal training or intervention; for example, one study changedclinician behavior by handing physicians a note before a patient visitthat reminded them not to interrupt the patient.40 Experts alsonoted that physicians should be attuned to cultural preferencesand language barriers that may influence a patient\u2019s comfort withuninterrupted speech.This practice focuses on learning about what is most important toa patient and developing shared priorities for a visit.46Understanding what matters to a patient is at the core ofpatientcentered, humanistic care, and when achieved early in the visit,helps set the stage for meaningful encounters.47 Evidencesuggests that collaborative agenda setting reduces last-minute newconcerns, improves patient satisfaction ratings, and positivelyinfluences symptoms such as pain and anxiety.39,43,48 A simpleform of this practice involves beginning the visit with anopenended question asking the patient to describe in their own wordswhy they are in the clinic: \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d or \u201cWhat is76jama.com\u201c[I have] a few minutes at least before each \u201c[Writing something personal about theinterview where I'm not talking to anybody, patient in the notes] is more about building aand just\u2026sort of prepare yourself.

It makesyourself, clear your heart and your mind and be the patient feel good that you know them\u201dready for things to come in and out\u201d (physician/researcher).(filmmaker).Sometimes I back away physically from peopleif I see they can\u2019t make eye contact with me.That gives them a sense of reassurance that I\u2019mnot there to invade them; I really am there tolisten deeply and allow them their experience\u201d(chaplain).We put together a statement of work.

This practice comprises 2 components: (          The second component of the practice involvesacknowledging specific patient efforts in a genuine and positive manner.Examples include using positive language such as statements ofapproval, empathy, reassurance, and partnership; offeringgenuine praise for patient efforts; and acknowledging small successeswhen appropriate.68,69 A physician\u2019s positivity has beenassociated with positive patient health outcomes,70 a finding thatparallels the evidence for positive coaching in athletes.71,72 Evidencetive, acknowledging a patient\u2019s efforts and celebrating successes.suggests that acknowledging patient efforts and progressThe first component involves being curious and forging aconnecthrough affirmation statements encourages adherence totreattion by asking a patient about his or her sociocultural backgroundment and behavior change69 and encourages patients toparticiand life circumstances.59,60 Research demonstrates that whenmedipate in their care.73 In one study, physicians who usedencouragcal students are instructed to \u201clook at the world through thepaing statements when discussing a diabetes diagnosis had bettertient\u2019s eyes and walk through the world in the patient\u2019s shoes,\u201d theypatient-perceived communication, which was significantlyassocireceive higher satisfaction ratings from standardized patients.61When physicians show active consideration of a patient\u2019sperspecated with patient well-being, less diabetes-related emotionalburden, less regimen-related distress, and better self-care.74 Whentive, it demonstrates that they want to understand the patient, andphysicians received interpersonal communication skills training toit creates an atmosphere of shared presence47 and may directlyinincrease positive talk (approval) and empathy (reassurance) and77decrease negative talk, patient-physician communication scoresincreased, and patients reported decreased distress and greatersatisfaction with the medical encounter.42,68,75 While rigorousevaluations of this practice examined in-depth training formultiple communication behaviors,42,68,75 expert panelists thoughtthat the use of positive framing and language could be adoptedwith minimal time and resource investment, and that this practicecould contribute to the joy of practice.          The fifth practice focuses on exploring emotion through (          Systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have examinedthe effectiveness of training clinicians to accurately perceivepatient emotions demonstrate that brief training, including in aself-administered format,83 can improve skills in decodingnonverbal emotional cues.26,79,84 There is also evidence that whenclinicians actively attend to patients\u2019 emotional concerns, andreflect this through their own emotional expression, patientsexperienced shorter and less severe illness.78 From animplementation perspective, adopting this practice may require a greaterresource investment than others, and engaging in emotion may attimes increase visit length78; however, evidence suggests thateffective engagement with patient emotion can actually decreasevisit length while increasing patient satisfaction,85 and theassociation between emotional awareness and clinical outcomes78may justify additional visit time.Human connection remains central to medicine but is in jeopardy inthe current health care environment. In an era of increasingreliance on technology for health records, diagnosis, and treatment,recognizing and prioritizing the value of human connection andcare are crucial. We identified practices grounded in scientificevidence that have the potential to foster physician presence andimprove the experience of clinicians and patients.This report describes an application of human-centereddesign principles, combined with a modified Delphi process, toidentify promising practices related to humanistic care of thepatient. Traditionally, Delphi panels have been used to definequality indicators and establish clinical guidelines,86,87 oftenaround a specific disease or set of conditions, and typically withthe benefit of randomized trials and meta-analyses. In this study,however, the focus was on interpersonal interactions with broadrelevance to all patient-clinician encounters, and the quantity andquality of evidence for specific practices was heterogeneous. Wetherefore relied on triangulation among published literature,qualitative interviews with physicians, patients, and nonmedicalprofessionals (whose perspective and wisdom are nottraditionally integrated into medical practice), and expert feedback.Our methods and the resulting findings demonstrate a novelapproach to Delphi panels that expands the inputs beyond thetraditional quantitative data of clinical trials and meta-analyses toinclude qualitative and human-centered design inputs.This process ultimately identified 5 distinct evidence andnarrative-based practices to be promising with regard to improvingclinician and patient experience. The practices incorporate manyprinciples that are intuitively modeled by clinicians such as Peabody andgrams for clinicians, such as the 4 Habits Model and the HumanismeAppendix 6 in the Supplement). Through our mixed-methodsapproach, we elucidated specific clinician behaviors, questions andstatements, and actions that may serve as steps to implementingeach practice in the clinical setting.It is likely that each of the practices presented could beadopted with minimal training and effort. For some of the morecomplex practices, such as exploring emotional cues, an intensiveworkshop may provide a richer and more effective skill set.However, even in these cases, there are simple, concrete actions(eg, tuning into facial expressions, asking how the patient is feeling)that can benefit the patient. While adopting any particular practiceindividually may have a limited influence, collectively they addressmany of the domains that are central to effective patient-centeredcare and partnership. The advantage of these simple and tangiblepractices is that they are relatively easy to adopt and disseminate\u2014which could result in a greater population-level effect over time.Importantly, our findings do not fully address the broaderpressures that threaten physician presence. Physician-focusedinterventions cannot alone be the bulwark against various threats tohuman connection in patient-physician encounters. As technological,business, and regulatory priorities all increasingly place pressure onthe clinical encounter, often without additional allotted time, thereis ever more need for cultural and structural changes withinorganizations to prioritize meaningful interactions.This study has several limitations. First, given the breadth of thesystematic literature review, our process might not have capturedall relevant literature for certain practices, and the strength ofevidence varied across practices (eAppendix 6 in the Supplement).A bridge search (August 2017\u2013September 2019) revealed 16additional published studies of interpersonal interventions. As before,most interventions focused on communications skills (38%),shared decision-making (25%), or fostering the patient-physicianrelationship (13%). The additional articles reinforced the originalliterature review\u2019s finding that the strongest evidence forinterpersonal interventions relates to their potential effect on patientexperience (10 articles) and clinician experience (7 articles); only1 study examined the effect on health outcomes (eAppendix 1in the Supplement). Second, while international literature was78jama.comwell-represented and the qualitative research efforts wereattentive to diversity, convenience sampling was used for the qualitativeformative research, and as such, primary care observation siteswere limited to Northern California.Third, expert panelists were all from the United States. Given thatthe patient-physician relationship is contextualized by local culture andnorms, findings from this work should be validated throughinternational comparative studies and with experts from other countries.Fourth, the recommended 5 practices have not been validated as agroup to determine whether collectively they will achieve theintended outcomes. Additional research is needed to evaluate whetheran intervention that incorporates the 5 practices will indeed increasephysician presence and connection with patients and improvepatient and clinician experience and clinical outcomes.This mixed-methods study identified 5 practices that have thepotential to enhance physician presence and meaningful connectionwith patients in the clinical encounter. Evaluation and validation ofthe outcomes associated with implementing the 5 practices isneeded, along with system-level interventions to create asupportive environment for implementation.ARTICLE INFORMATIONAccepted for Publication: November 5, 2019.Conflict of Interest Disclosures: Ms ThadaneyIsrani reported serving on the boards of Scients.organd the Society of Bedside Medicine; both roles areunpaid.
