Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claimingdetection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positivecases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the samplingprocess, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods isimperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity andaccommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers.The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for directidentification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide furtherconfirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific straindiscrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a globalhealth imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomicmethod that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential foruncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.A severe epidemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, now just characterized as a pandemic by theWorld Health Organization (WHO), started in December of 2019 in Wuhan China and quickly spread tomany countries in the world1-3. It has caused over 4000 deaths thus far and made daily impacts onvarious aspects of societal life around the globe4. SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus with positive-sense,single-stranded RNA about 30kb in length. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is currently under carefulinvestigation5-9 and being extensively modeled according to the Chinese National Center for Biologicalinformation (2019 New Coronavirus Information Database, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). Of note,SARSCoV-2 exhibits over 99% sequence similarity among many sequenced isolates, and is also highly similarto other coronaviruses5,9.Present methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and discussed10,11, includingRTPCR, serological testing12 and reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification13,14.Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 due to its ease of use andhigh sensitivity. RT-PCR has been reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva15, pharyngeal swab, blood,anal swab16, urine, stool17, and sputum specimens18. In laboratory conditions, the RT-PCR methodologyhas been shown to detect 4-8 copies of virus, through amplification of targets in the Orf1ab, E and Nviral genes, at 95% confidence intervals19-21. However, only about 47-59% of the positive cases wereidentified by RT-PCR, and 75% of RT-PCR negative results were actually found to be positive, withrepeated tests required17,22-24. In addition, there is evidence suggesting that heat inactivation of clinicalsamples causes loss of virus particles, thereby hindering the efficiency of downstream diagnosticevaluation25.Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to develop robust, sensitive, specific and highly quantitativemethods for the delivery of reliable diagnostic assays26,27. The urgency to develop an effectivesurveillance method that can be easily used in a variety of laboratory settings is underlined by the wideand rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-228-30. In addition, such method should also distinguish SARS-CoV-2from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratorysyncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, etc., as well as mycoplasmapneumoniae, chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia31-34. Furthermore, providing nucleotidesequence information through next generation sequencing (NGS) will prove to be essential for thesurveillance of SARS-CoV-2\u2019s evolution35-38. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic studies through genomesequence analysis have provided better understanding of the transmission origin, time and routes,which has guided policy-making and management procedures8,36,37,39-41.For this type of technology, we reveal the development of a highly sensitive and robustdetection assay incorporating the use of multiplex PCR technology to identify SARS-CoV-2. Theoretically,the multiplex PCR strategy, by amplifying hundreds of targets, has significantly higher sensitivity thanRT-PCR and may even detect DNA molecules resulting from degraded virus genome fragments.Multiplex PCR has been shown to be an efficient and low-cost method to detect Plasmodium falciparuminfections, with high coverage (median 99%), specificity (99.8%) and sensitivity. Moreover, this solutioncan be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions of interest within various epidemiologicalsettings42. Similar to a recently described metagenomic approach for SARS-CoV-2 identification43, wealso establish a user-friendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is not only able to detectSARS-CoV-2, but could also be applied for the identification of significant sequence mutations withinknown viruses and to uncover novel pathogens with a limited sequencing depth of approximately 1million reads.Several RT-PCR methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to date15,19-21. Among them, twogroups reported the detection of 4-5 copies of the virus19,21. To investigate the opportunity for furtherimprovement on the sensitivity of RT-PCR, we built a mathematical model to estimate the limit ofdetection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2. The reported RT-PCR amplicon lengths are around 78-158bp, and theSARS-CoV-2 genome is 29903bp (NC_045512.2). Thus, in this mathematical modeling, we chose 100bpamplicon length and 30kb SARS-CoV-2 genome size for the estimation. With the assumption of 99%RTPCR efficiency20, we found that RT-PCR assays could detect 4.8 copies of SARS-CoV-2 at 95% probability(Fig. 1A), which is consistent with the experimental results obtained in a previous report19. In this model,the probability of RT-PCR assays to detect one copy of SARS-CoV-2 is only 26%. This finding may explain,at least in part, the low reported 47-56% detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in positive samples byRTPCR17,22. We further found that the LOD appears to be independent of the virus genome size. Forgenomes of 4 to 100kb, the detection limit remains 4.8 copies at 95% probability (Supplemental Fig. 1).One way to elevate the sensitivity is to amplify multiple targets on the same virus genome in amultiplex PCR reaction, thereby increasing the frequency of occurrence in the mathematical model.Amplifying multiple targets has the advantage of potentially detecting fragments of degraded virusgenome while withstanding sequencing variations, thus allowing for the detection of upcoming mutants.The amplification efficiency of multiplex PCR is critical for LOD. We estimated that the efficiency of ourmultiplex PCR technology is about 26% by using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI)-labeled primers tocount the amplified products after NGS sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 2). However, the amplificationefficiency could be lower, and not all amplicons amplified successfully if the template used is one singlestrand of cDNA. Thus, more amplicons are potentially required for multiplex PCR to detect limited copiesof viruses.We thus designed a panel of 172 pairs of multiplex PCR primers for the sensitive detection ofSARS-CoV2 (Fig. 1B). The average amplicon length is 99bp. The amplicons run across the entire SARS-CoV-2genome with a 76bp gap (76\u00b110bp) between each amplicon. Since the observed efficiency of multiplexPCR is about 26% in amplifying the four DNA strands of a pair of human chromosomes, we assumed anefficiency of 6% in amplifying a single-strand of cDNA. In addition, it has already been reported that 79%of variants are recovered when directly amplifying 600 amplicons from a single cell using ourtechnology44. Therefore, we assume that 80% of amplicons would be amplified successfully. Using thesame mathematical model described above, we estimated that our specific SARS-CoV-2-designed panelcan detect 1.15 copies of the virus at 95% probability (Fig. 1C). Again, the LOD is independent of virusgenome size.We also designed a second pool of 171 multiplex PCR primers. These primers overlap with thosein the previous 172-primer pool. Together, these two overlapping pools of primers deliver full coverageof the entire virus genome. If using both pools in detection, the calculated detection limit is 0.29 copiesat 95% probability.The workflow was designed so that the multiplex PCR products are further amplified in a secondary PCR,while sample indexes and NGS sequencing primers are added (Fig. 1D). The PCR products were firstanalyzed by electrophoresis for identifying potential positives. Since dozens of amplicons could beamplified from a single copy of SARS-CoV-2, an electrophoresis peak with defined peak size wasexpected. Multiplex PCR amplifies SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses due to their highsequence similarities. In that context, electrophoresis analysis provides a fast and sensitive indication ofinfection from that family of viruses. In addition, the generated library allows for further investigationthrough NGS sequencing to provide definitive identification of the specific virus family member.Two plasmids, containing the full sequence of S and N genes of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, wereused to validate our multiplex PCR method. 28 amplicons are expected to be amplified within our172amplicon panel. To simulate the use of real clinical samples, these two plasmids were spiked into thecDNA made from human total RNA. The copy number of each plasmid was determined by droplet-baseddigital PCR in QX200 from Bio-Rad\u00ae45. The two plasmids were diluted from approximately 9,000 copiesto below one copy, and were amplified in multiplex PCR reactions. The library peaks of expected sizeswere obtained from 9,000 to 2.8 copies of plasmids (Fig. 2A). Quantification of peaks demonstrated awide dynamic range from 1 to about 1,000 copies of plasmids (Fig. 2B). The yield of the libraries startedto saturate when the copy number was 1,700. It is possible that the saturation point could be evenlower when all of the 172 amplicons are amplified from positive clinical samples, and the library peakcould be observed with even fewer copies of virus. In contrast, the detected quantities of a single targeton N gene by RT-PCR rapidly dropped when using 2.85 copies (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 3).Estimated from the aforementioned mathematical model, 28 amplicons have a 16% chance todetect one single copy. To test this hypothesis, we amplified about one copy of plasmid in multiplex PCRreactions. Considering a multiplex PCR efficiency of 6%, the theoretical calculation gives a 66%probability to sample 1.1 copies, and a 12% chance to detect them. In reality, we experimentallyobserved a significantly higher 56% probability to detect 1.1 copies (Fig. 2C). These results suggest thatthe efficiency of multiplex PCR is actually higher than the previously estimated 6% when single-strandedcDNA was amplified.When the amplified products were sequenced, we found that the recovered reads were within arange of 20-fold relative depth with about 1.4 to 2.8 plasmids, and uniformly distributed across the GCrange (Fig. 2D). When detecting down to 1.4 copies of plasmids, only the reads of one amplicon wereabout 100-fold lower than the average. Approximately 96% of the amplicons were recovered with 14copies of plasmids, 77% with 2.8 copies, and 37% with 0.6 copies (Fig. 2E).In order to discover highly mutated viruses and unknown pathogens, we subsequently developed auserfriendly multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method. In this method, random hexamer-adapters wereused to amplify DNA or cDNA targets in a multiplex PCR reaction. The large amounts of non-specificamplification products were removed by using Paragon Genomics\u2019 proprietary background removingreagent, thus resolving a library suitable for sequencing. For RNA samples, our reverse transcriptionreagents were additionally used to convert RNA into cDNA, resulting in significantly reduced amount ofhuman ribosomal RNA species.We sequenced a library made with 4,500 copies of N and S gene-containing plasmids spiked into10 ng of human gDNA, which roughly represents 3,300 haploid genomes. Even though the molar ratiosof viral targets and human haploid genomes were comparable, N and S genes which encompass about4kb of targets, were a negligible fraction of the 3 billion base pairs of a human genome. If every regionof the human genome was amplified and sequenced at 0.6 million reads per sample, only one read ofviral target would be recovered. Our results show that 16% of the recovered bases, or 13% of therecovered reads, were within the viral N and S genes (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Table 1). 80% and 78%of SARS-CoV-19 and mitochondrial targets were covered, respectively (Fig. 3B), and the base coveragewas significantly higher than human targets (Fig. 3C). In contrast, only 0.08% of regions in humanchromosomes were amplified. Furthermore, the human exonic regions were preferentially amplified(Fig. 3D). This suggested that the random hexamers deselected a large portion of the human genome,while favorably amplifying regions that were more \u201crandom\u201d in base composition. Indeed, long gaps andabsence of coverage in very large repetitive regions were observed in human chromosomes (Fig. 3E). Onthe contrary, the gaps in SARS-CoV-19 and mitochondrial regions were significantly shorter (Fig. 3F),whereas the amplified targets overlapped and were longer than human targets (Fig. 3G).The coverage was from 1000- to 10,000-fold for S and N genes, and 30- to 500-fold for themitochondrial chromosome (Fig. 3F). The coverage is roughly within a 10-fold range, as is observed inhuman chromosomes (Fig. 3E). Therefore, increasing sequencing depth might not significantly improvethe coverage. This 10-fold difference in coverage has been routinely observed with our multiplex PCRtechnology (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Fig. 5). We were able to detect 80% of the regionsfrom S and N genes in libraries generated using 4,500 copies of plasmids, with an average base coverageof 5,000 for a total sequencing depth of 0.6 million reads. A few targets of 150 to 200 bp in length fromS and N genes were preferentially amplified. Even when copy number went down to a few copies (3-14),these targets were still detected (Fig.4). They represented 14% and 11% of the target regions when 14and 2.8 copies of plasmids were amplified, respectively.Tremendous efforts have been made from around the world to provide a fast and reliable diagnosticmethod for SARS-CoV-19. RT-PCR is currently the preferential and most frequently used detectionstrategy. Yet, we found that the LOD for RT-PCR sits at around 5 copies with 95% confidence,independent of the size of the target genome. Consequently, to overcome the instability of RNA and thegenomic sequence variability of virus genome due to evolution, more sensitive and robust methods arerequired.Here, we report the development of a multiplex PCR assay for accurate identification of thenovel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. With 172 pairs of primers, this method enables the detectionof low copy numbers, potentially degraded fragments of the viral genome, or even a mutated variant,with high confidence. The 172 pairs of primers cover about 56% of the genome of SARS-CoV-19. Whendetecting limited copies of virus, fewer targets are successfully amplified. In the case of one copy ofvirus, we estimate that 20% of the viral genome, or 6kb of sequences, can be amplified. These aresufficient to produce a conspicuous peak in electrophoresis for an initial indication of positives. The useof NGS sequencing can provide nucleic acid-level information to further confirm the identification, andprovide additional evidence for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, our method is robust, accurate andeasily performed from different levels of expertise in various laboratory settings.Furthermore, we also propose a metagenomic method for the potential identification ofunknown pathogens. Metagenomic technology usually requires about 20 to 100 million of sequencingreads in order to detect minuscule numbers of targets embedded in the massive amounts of humanbackground. However, our method appears to selectively amplify target sequences. This bias permitsthe obtention of around 16% of target bases by sequencing at a depth of about 1 million total reads. It isthus especially suitable for the detection of novel pathogens and highly genetically unstable pathogens,such as influenza viruses. The exact mechanism of deselecting human sequences is currently underinvestigation. The random hexamer preference, chromosomal structure, sequence composition, targetlength, circularity, methylation status, telomeric and centromeric regions, as well as the edge effect,may influence such outcome. Ultimately, the observed preferential amplification towards more\u201crandom\u201d sequences could provide us with an advantageous edge for the continuous improvement ofthis method.The Universal Human Reference RNA was from Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Cat#74000). The plasmidscontaining either S or N gene of SARS-CoV-2 (pUC-S and pUC-N, respectively) were purchased fromSangon Biotech, Shanghai, China. The PCR primers used in ddPCR and RT-PCR reactions for S gene are5\u2019TGTACTTGGACAATCAAAAAGAGTTGAT and 5\u2019-AGGAGCAGTTGTGAAGTTCTTTTC; for N gene are5\u2019GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT and 5\u2019-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, respectively. 343 pairs of multiplexPCR primers covering the entire genome of SARS-CoV-2 (the panel) were designed by ParagonGenomics, Inc. and separated into two pools. Pool 1, containing 172 pairs of primers, was used in thedetection of SARS-CoV-2 by multiplex PCR.50ng of Universal Human Reference RNA was converted into cDNA using random primers andSuperScript\u2122 IV Reverse Transcriptase by following the supplier recommended method (Thermo FisherScientific, Cat# 18090050). After reverse transcription, cDNA was purified with 2.4X volume of magneticbeads, and washed twice with 70% ethanol. Finally, the purified cDNA was dissolved in 1X TE buffer andused per multiplex PCR reaction.Panel design is based on the SARS-CoV-2 sequence NC_045512.2(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2/). In total, 343 primer pairs, distributed into twopools, were selected by a proprietary panel design pipeline to cover the whole genome except for 92bases at its ends. Primers were optimized to preferentially amplify the SARS-CoV-2 cDNA versusbackground human cDNA or genomic DNA. They were also optimized to uniformly amplify the coveredgenome.Plasmids pUC-S and pUC-N were combined with human cDNA and used in each multiplex PCR reaction.Paragon Genomics\u2019 CleanPlex\u00ae multiplex PCR reagents and protocol were used. Briefly, a 10\u00b5l multiplexPCR reaction was made by combining 5X mPCR mix, 10X Pool 1 of the panel, plasmid pUC-S, pUC-N andcDNA. The reaction was run in a thermal cycler (95\u00b0C for 10min, then 98\u00b0C for 15sec, 60\u00b0C for 5min for10 cycles), then terminated by the addition of 2\u00b5l of stop buffer. The reaction was then purified by 29\u00b5lof magnetic beads, followed by a secondary PCR with a pair of primers for 25 cycles. The secondary PCRadded sample indexes and sequencing adapters, allowing for sequencing of the resulting products byhigh throughput sequencing. A final bead purification was performed after the secondary PCR, followedby library interrogation using a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument with Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit(Agilent Technologies, Inc. Part# 5067-4626).RT-PCRPlasmids pUC-S and pUC-N, in combination with human cDNA, were used in each reaction. ParagonGenomics\u2019 CleanPlex\u00ae secondary PCR mix was used with 100nM of each PCR primers in 10ul reactions.The PCR thermal cycling protocol used was 95\u00b0C for 10min, then 98\u00b0C for 15sec, 60\u00b0C for 30sec for 45cycles.Paragon Genomics\u2019 CleanPlex\u00ae metagenomic reagents and protocol were used. Briefly, a 10\u00b5l multiplexPCR reaction was made by combining 5X mPCR mix, 10X random hexamer-adapters and the templateDNA. The PCR thermal cycling protocol used was 95\u00b0C for 10min, then 98\u00b0C for 15sec, 25\u00b0C for 2min,60\u00b0C for 5min for 10 cycles. The reaction was then terminated by the addition of 2\u00b5l of stop buffer, andpurified by 29\u00b5l of magnetic beads. The resulting solution was treated with 2\u00b5l of CleanPlex\u00ae reagent at37\u00b0C for 10min to remove non-specific amplification products. After a magnetic bead purification, theproduct was further amplified in a secondary PCR with a pair of primers for 25 cycles to produce themetagenomic library. This metagenomic library was further purified by magnetic beads beforesequencing.ddPCRddPCR was performed on QX200 from Bio-Rad\u00ae. Plasmids pUC-S and pUC-N at the estimated copynumbers 1 (6 repeats), 2 (3 repeats), and 100 (3 repeats) were tested. In each reaction, the ddPCRthermal cycling protocol used was 95\u00b0C for 5min, then 95\u00b0C for 30sec, 60\u00b0C for 1min with 60 cycles, 4\u00b0Cfor 5min and 90\u00b0C for 5min, 4\u00b0C hold. The resulting data was analyzed by following the supplierrecommended method.High throughput sequencing was performed using Illumina and MGI sequencers. The resulting data wasanalyzed by Paragon Genomics\u2019 Bioinformatics team with proprietary pipelines and algorithms.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23.24.25.26.27.Wu, A., et al., Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)Originating in China.

The LOD is 4.8 copies of virus at 95%probability. (B) Two overlapping pools of multiplex PCR primers were designed for the entire genome ofSARS-CoV-19. Pool 1, containing 172 pairs of primers, covers 56.9% of the viral genome and was used inour detection experiments. Pool 2 contains 171 pairs of primers and covers 56.4% of the genome. Bothpools are used to cover the full length of the genome. In the mathematical model analysis, 4.8 copiescan be detected at 95% probability using RT-PCR. (C) A mathematical model of multiplex PCR with pool 1of the primers. The LOD is 1.15 copies of virus at 95% probability. (D) The workflow of the multiplex PCRmethod. The results can be detected in a high-resolution electrophoresis, and sequenced with hundredsof samples in high-throughput sequencing.(A) Two plasmids, containing S and N genes of SARS-CoV-19, respectively, were diluted in human cDNAand amplified in multiplex PCR with pool 1 (172 pairs of primers). The number of plasmid copies perreaction, determined by ddPCR, were from 8,900 to 0.6. The resulting products obtained after librarypreparation were resolved in electrophoresis. The specific amplification products (the library) can still beseen with 2.8 copies of plasmids. (B) The library yields can be detected down to 0.6 copies of plasmids(n=4), while only down to 2.8 copies can still be detected by RT-PCR (> 4.5-fold difference). (C) Poissonprocess was used to estimate the chance of sampling around 1 copy of viral particles, and themathematical model was used to estimate the chance of detecting them (red line). There is 12% ofprobability to detect 1.1 copies with a multiplex PCR efficiency of 6%. In reality, we observed asignificantly higher 56% probability for 1.1 copies and 100% probability for 1.4 copies. (D) Aftersequencing 2.8 copies of plasmids, the reads of all 28 amplicons spanning both N and S genes wereclustered within a 20-fold range of coverage (n=3). After sequencing 1.4 copies, only the reads of oneamplicon were about 100-fold lower than the average (n=3). (E) About 96% of amplicons wererecovered with 14 copies of plasmids, 77% with 2.8 copies, and 37% with 0.6 copies (n=3).(A) Random hexamer-adapters were used in multiplex PCR to amplify 4,500 copies of plasmids in thebackground of 3,300 haploid human gDNA molecules. The resulting libraries were sequenced at anaverage of 0.6 million total reads. Of the total bases recovered, 16% were on SARS-CoV-19 S and Ngenes. (B) 80% of S and N genes, and 78% of the human mitochondrial chromosome were amplifiedwith >= 1X coverage, while only 0.08% of the human chromosomes were. (C) On average, S and N geneswere covered at 2,346X, mitochondria at 77X, and human chromosomes at 20X. (D) Human exons wererelatively over-amplified as compared to their actual ratio within the genome. (E) Gaps and long regionsof absence of amplification were observed for human chromosomes. An example shown here ischromosome Y. Smaller gaps were additionally found in the enlarged cluster of amplification. The longabsent region (arrows) overlapped with the repetitive regions on Y chromosome. (F) Representation ofthe recovered regions in S and N genes and the human mitochondrial chromosome.

Of note,SARSCoV-2 exhibits over 99% sequence similarity among many sequenced isolates, and is also highly similarto other coronaviruses5,9.Present methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and discussed10,11, includingRTPCR, serological testing12 and reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification13,14.Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 due to its ease of use andhigh sensitivity. Moreover, this solutioncan be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions of interest within various epidemiologicalsettings42. Thus, more amplicons are potentially required for multiplex PCR to detect limited copiesof viruses. In addition, it has already been reported that 79%of variants are recovered when directly amplifying 600 amplicons from a single cell using ourtechnology44. Therefore, we assume that 80% of amplicons would be amplified successfully. Together, these two overlapping pools of primers deliver full coverageof the entire virus genome. 28 amplicons are expected to be amplified within our172amplicon panel. It is possible that the saturation point could be evenlower when all of the 172 amplicons are amplified from positive clinical samples, and the library peakcould be observed with even fewer copies of virus. 3).Estimated from the aforementioned mathematical model, 28 amplicons have a 16% chance todetect one single copy. These results suggest thatthe efficiency of multiplex PCR is actually higher than the previously estimated 6% when single-strandedcDNA was amplified. Furthermore, the human exonic regions were preferentially amplified(Fig. Tremendous efforts have been made from around the world to provide a fast and reliable diagnosticmethod for SARS-CoV-19. RT-PCR is currently the preferential and most frequently used detectionstrategy. These aresufficient to produce a conspicuous peak in electrophoresis for an initial indication of positives. The useof NGS sequencing can provide nucleic acid-level information to further confirm the identification, andprovide additional evidence for phylogenetic analysis. The exact mechanism of deselecting human sequences is currently underinvestigation. They were also optimized to uniformly amplify the coveredgenome.
