For lead to media and public concern. every outbreak, global preparedness for, and response The balance between providing the information capacities to, emerging and re-emerging infectious required for appropriate actions in response to risk and diseases with epidemic potential can be improved providing information that fuels inappropriate actions upon. The rapid, well coordinated global response is delicate. The global media response to 2019-nCoV to the emergence and detection of 2019-nCoV, and remains unbalanced, largely due to the continuously eefctive communication between scientists, researchers, evolving developments and, as a result, public perception and epidemiologists and public health and funding of risk remains exaggerated. agencies, was unprecedented compared with past The many unknown factors surrounding the virus are outbreaks.

Additionally,the disparity between the strength of language aspresented to the media by some researchers andpoliticians and the inference shared on social mediarequires more research to determine how content isbeing relayed on diferent platforms.An efective way of putting this outbreak intoperspective is to compare it with other respiratory tractinfections with epidemic potential. 2019-nCoV appearsto fit the same pattern as influenza, with most peoplerecovering and with a low death rate; the people atrisk of increased mortality are older in age (>65 years),immunosuppressed, or have comorbid illnesses. Thereis currently no evidence that 2019-nCoV spreads morerapidly than influenza or has a higher mortality rate.The media should focus on having altruistic intentionsand develop dialogue with the appropriate authoritiesto protect global health security through eefctiveamiable partnerships. They should highlight vaccinedevelopment eofrts as well as educational and publichealth measures that are being put in place to preventthe spread of infection. Although there are many thingsto still learn regarding how best to respond to diseaseoutbreaks of this nature,7 there are also several positives,such as diagnostics tests being developed within 2 weeksand rolled out globally or the rapid garnering of nfiancialsupport for vaccine development, which should perhapsbe in the headlines, to fuel reassurance rather than fear.GI, AZ, and FN are co-primary investigators of the Pan-African Network onEmerging and Re-emerging Infections (PANDORA-ID-NET) funded by theEuropean and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership the EU Horizon2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.
