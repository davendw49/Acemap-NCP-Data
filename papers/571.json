Asymptomatic infectious individuals I(t) are infectious for anaverage period of 1= days. Reported symptomatic individuals R(t) are infectious for an average periodof 1= days, as are unreported symptomatic individuals U (t). We assume that reported symptomaticinfectious individuals R(t) are reported and isolated immediately, and cause no further infections. Theasymptomatic individuals I(t) can also be viewed as having a low-level symptomatic state. All infectionsare acquired from either I(t) or U (t) individuals. The fraction f of asymptomatic infectious becomereported symptomatic infectious, and the fraction 1 f become unreported symptomatic infectious.The rate asymptomatic infectious become reported symptomatic is 1 = f , the rate asymptomaticinfectious become unreported symptomatic is 2 = (1 f ) , where 1 + 2 = .

The actual value of f is unknown. We assume = 1=7, which means that the averageperiod of infectiousness of both unreported symptomatic infectious individuals and reported symptomaticinfectious individuals is 7 days. We assume = 1=7, which means that the average period of infectiousnessof asymptomatic infectious individuals is 7 days. These values can be modified as further epidemiologicalinformation becomes known.We assume that in the second phase of a COVID-19 epidemic, the cumulative number of reportedcases CR(t) grows approximately exponentially, according to the formula:CR(t) =1 exp( 2 t)3; tt0:We fix the value 3 = 1. The values of 1 and 2 are fitted to cumulative reported case data in theearly phase of the epidemic, when it is recognized that CR(t) is growing exponentially (i.e. we use anexponential fit 1 exp( 2 t) to fit the data CR(t) + 1). We assume the initial value S0, corresponds tothe population of the region of the reported case data. The value of the susceptible population S(t) isassumed to be only slightly changed by removal of the number of people infected in the beginning of thesecond phase. The other initial conditions areI0 =2f ( 1 + 2); U0 =(1f )( 1 + 2)+ 2I0; R0 = 1:0:The value of the transmission rate (t), during the second phase of the epidemic, when the cumulativenumber of reported cases grows approximately exponential, is the constant valueThe initial time for the beginning of the early exponential growth phase isThe value of the basic reproductive number is(4.1)(4.2)(4.3)(4.4)(4.5)0 =2 + 1 + 2S0+2 +2+2        :These formulas for I0, U0, t0, 0, and R0 were derived in [        During the second phase (t) 0 is constant. When strong government measures such as isolation,quarantine, and public closings are implemented, the third phase begins. The actual effects of thesemeasures are complex, and we use an exponential decrease for a time-dependent decreasing transmissionrate (t) in the third phase to incorporate these effects. The formula for (t) during the third phase is( (t) = 0; 0tN;(t) = 0 exp ((tN )) ; N < t:(4.6)The date N and the value of are chosen so that the cumulative reported cases in the numericalsimulation of the epidemic aligns with the cumulative reported case data after day N , when the publicmeasures take effect. In this way we are able to project forward the time-path of the epidemic after thegovernment imposed public restrictions take effect.

With this data, we project the future numberof cases, both reported and unreported, in each country. We assume a fraction f of total cases areunreported. We simulate our model with f = 0:6 and f = 0:1 for each country. The fractions f = 0:6and f = 0:1 correspond to lesser and greater final sizes, respectively. For South Korea, the epidemic hassubsided, because of the major measures that were implemented to restrict public distancing. For Italy,France, and Germany, the epidemics are still rising, because these measures have been implemented onlyrecently.        Our model incorporates social distancing measures through the time dependent transmission rate (t)in the third phase. This rate involves (the rate of exponential decay corresponding to these measures)and N the day at which they become effective. It is evident that these measures should start as earlyas possible, and should be as strong as possible. The consequences of late public interventions may havesevere consequences for the epidemic outcome (as illustrated in Figure 6 in [        In the case of South Korea, the peak of the epidemic occurred approximately February 29. In Figures5 and 6, we see that our model agrees very well the data for South Korea. Accordingly to our model, thedaily number of cases reaches a maximum of approximately 700 cases near the turning point February29.Compared to South Korea, the public interventions in Italy, France, and Germany were relativelylate. The peak of the epidemic occurs in Italy around April 9, in France around April 14, and in Germanyaround May 1. The maximum daily number of cases is between 10 000 and 15 000 in Italy, between 12 000and 20 000 in France, and between 200 000 and 500 000 in Germany. These numbers will likely remainhigh for an extended period of several months for these three countries, without further major publicmeasures.Conflicts of Interest: Declare conflicts of interest or state \"The authors declare no conflict of interest.\"", "ref_list": [[], ["Understanding unreported cases in the 2019-nCov epidemic outbreak in Wuhan, China, and the importance of major public health interventions"], ["Webb, Predicting the cumulative number of cases for the COVID19 epidemic in China from early data"], [""], ["Early dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], ["Z.
