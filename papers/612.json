Our results show which interventions potentially push the epidemic peak into the subsequent year (when vaccinations may be available) or which fail. Different levels of control (via contact reduction) resulted in 22% to 63% of the population sick, 0.2% to 0.6% hospitalised, and 0.07% to 0.28% dead (n=6,450 to 28,228). There is pandemic spread of the new coronavirus \u201cSARS-Cov-2\u201d, causing the disease \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting over 200,000 cases and over 8000 deaths on 19 March 2020 [1]. One approach to informing the potential health burden and relevant control measures for a new pandemic is to study its dynamics using mathematical models. Recently published mathematical modelling work on COVID-19 has reported that \u201cin most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months\u201d [2]. Another modelling study found that \u201ccombining all four interventions (social distancing of the entire population, case isolation, household quarantine and school and university closure) is predicted to have the largest impact, short of a complete lockdown which additionally prevents people going to work\u201d [3]. Other such models have been used to estimate the impact of disease control measures in China [4, 5]. Given this background, we explore the potential health impact of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in a hypothetical European country of 10 million people to determine the potential impact of control measures, particularly to push the epidemic into a subsequent year, a time when a vaccine might become available. Europe's first cases of COVID-19 were reported to WHO on 25 January in France [6]. But 19 March there were 52 of these countries with reported cases, with 12 reporting 1000+ cases [1]. By this time major control interventions were in place in many of these countries [7]. In this modelling, we took the standard approach of using a deterministic SEIR model i.e., key compartments for: susceptible [S], exposed [E], infected [I], and recovered/removed [R]. We developed this model specifically for COVID-19. It is freely available online with a dashboard display to facilitate user interaction (http://covidsim.eu; version 1.0, 19 March). The Appendix", "text": "        details the parameters, derived variables and differential equations used in the CovidSIM model.Table A1 in the Appendix provides the input parameters used in the model, as based on availablepublications and best estimates used in the modelling work on COVID-19 to date                Our results suggest that pushing the peak of the epidemic into the next year, when assuming a lowbasic reproduction number (R0) of only 1.5, was achievable with \u201cgeneral contact reduction\u201d atlevels of over 11% to over 27% (for differing time periods) (Table 1). Similarly, it was achievable forprobabilities of isolating symptomatic cases in hospital in the range of over 18% to over 41% (Table1). Using instead a possibly more realistic value of 2.5 for R0, the only way of shifting the epidemicpeak into the next year with interventions lasting for nine months, was if: (i) over 65% of contactswere reduced; or (ii) if the probability of cases being isolated in hospitals was extremely high at over98%. Also for R0 = 3.5, pushing the epidemic peak into the subsequent year was generally notpossible, except if contact reduction was over 61% for the rest of the simulated year.The feasibility of achieving high levels of contact reduction and case isolation is very uncertain \u2013especially around sustaining these for long periods of time. At least in the short-term China has usedintensive containment measures successfully as per the findings of the WHO-China Joint MissionReport [8]. This report stated that: \u201cChina has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, andaggressive disease containment effort in history.\u201d While it is an open question around thegeneralisability of the Chinese approach to other jurisdictions [9], there is also evidence ofcontainment success        Considering the three levels of R0 and the two levels of \u201cgeneral contact reduction\u201d (at 25% and50%) resulted in: 22% to 63% of the population sick, 8.8% to 25.1% seeking a medical consultation,0.2% to 0.6% needing to be hospitalised, 5,500 to 15,682 people needing critical care (in an ICU),2,750 to 7,841 requiring ventilators, and 6,450 to 28,200 dying (0.07% to 0.28% of the population)(Table 2). The worst scenario with 0.28% of the population dying, compares to Europe in the 1918influenza pandemic where 1.1% died (2.64 million excess deaths) [11].Based on the recent age distribution data from China [12], these hospitalisations and deaths fromCOVID-19 would particularly occur amongst older age-groups. Overall, the levels of health servicedemand in the more severe scenarios would be completely unprecedented for a modern Europeancountry.This is one of the first SEIR modelling studies of this new pandemic disease COVID-19 and theassociated online simulation tool has advanced dashboard features and graphic visualisation ofresults that facilitate user engagement. Nevertheless, there are always limitations with modellingwork. Some of these are discussed under issues with parameter uncertainty in Table A1, but here wenote some of the more substantive limitations:\uf0b7 There is still a high degree of uncertainty around many aspects of COVID-19 epidemiology.For example, the value of R0 could conceivably be higher than the highest level in thescenarios we modelled (at R0 = 3.5). Also, the case fatality risk (CFR) could beunderestimated, especially if there was health system overload.\uf0b7 The model was deterministic and not stochastic, though we largely offset this issue withmodelling a wide range of scenarios. The lack of stochastic considerations mainly translatesinto increased uncertainty in the very early stages of epidemic spread, which then impacts onthe timing of the peak.\uf0b7 The model neither considers any long-term health damage to survivors (especially among riskpatients) nor does it consider the hard-to-estimate health loss arising from untreated otherhealth conditions as a result of having an overburdened health system. Likewise we do notconsider the additional health harm to the health workers involved e.g., adverse mental healthimpacts arising from working during a pandemic [13, 14].Some of these issues can be addressed when improved data becomes available on the epidemiologyof COVID-19. Nevertheless, public health workers can consider using this model in their owncountries and adapt the parameters according to local settings and as the epidemiologicalcharacteristics of COVID-19 are better ascertained.push the epidemic into the next year (for a 6 monthintervention period)\u2013 for 9 month intervention period (274 days)\u2013 for rest of the simulated yearProportion of cases in hospital isolation (with home isolation at 50% effectiveness when hospitalcapacity is exceeded; beginning on day 5 of the simulation)R0=1.5>27%>14%>11%>41%>21%>18%R0=1.5 R0=2.5 R0=3.5Consultations (40% of symptomatic cases seek consultations, possibly mainly telephone/internet)Severe cases likely to require hospitalisation (1.0% of symptomatic cases)1,330,95313.3%880,0418.8%2,166,32221.7%2,490,2222,208,647Cases likely to require ICU (25% of hospitalised cases)Cases likely to require ventilation in ICU (50% of those in ICU)Deaths (case fatality risk amongst symptomatic cases of 0.45%)* Results for R0=1.5 scenarios are shaded as they were both right truncated (i.e., only the results for the first 365 days ofthe simulation are reported) as the epidemic peak was pushed into either very late in the year (for 25% reduction) or thefollowing year (for 50% reduction).** Results in these rows were not standard outputs for the CovidSIM model but were based on further Excel-basedcalculations from the CovidSIM output.\uf0ef\uf0e5 pSick Ik \uf028t \uf029\uf0ef k \uf03d1\uf0ef\uf0efI Iso \uf028t \uf029 \uf03d \uf0edQmax\uf0ef\uf0ef0\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0eeAppendix: Description of the CovidSIM model and model input parameters\uf0ec nI\uf0ef\uf0e5 pSick Ik \uf028t \uf029\uf0ef k \uf03d1\uf0ef\uf0efI Iso \uf028t \uf029 \uf03d \uf0edQmax\uf0ef\uf0ef0\uf0ef\uf0ef\uf0eeiftIso1 \uf0a3 t \uf0a3 tIso2if tIso1 \uf0a3 t \uf0a3 tIso2andandif t \uf03c tIso1ort \uf03e tIso2nI\uf0ec nI\uf0ef\uf0e5 pSick Ik \uf028t \uf029 \uf02d Qmax if tIso1 \uf0a3 t \uf0a3 tIso2I Home \uf028t \uf029 \uf03d \uf0ed k \uf03d1\uf0ef\uf0ee0 otherwiseand\uf0e5 pSick Ik \uf028t \uf029 \uf03e QmaxnIdSdtS \uf0e7\uf0e6 nP \uf0e6 nI \uf0f6\uf0f7 \uf02b\uf079 \uf0f6\uf0f7\uf0281 \uf02d cCont \uf028t \uf029\uf029\uf03d \uf02d N \uf0e7\uf0e8\uf062 P \uf028t \uf029\uf0e5k\uf03d1 Pk \uf028t \uf029 \uf02b \uf062 I \uf028t \uf029\uf0e7\uf0e7\uf0e8 \uf0e5k\uf03d1 Ik \uf028t \uf029 \uf02d I Iso \uf028t \uf029 \uf02d I Home \uf028t \uf029cHome \uf0f7\uf0f8 \uf0f7\uf0f8dE1 \uf03d NS \uf0e7\uf0e6\uf0e7\uf062 P \uf028t \uf029 \uf0e5nP Pk \uf028t \uf029 \uf02b \uf062 I \uf028t \uf029\uf0e6\uf0e7 \uf0e5nI Ik \uf028t \uf029 \uf02d I Iso \uf028t \uf029 \uf02d I Home \uf028t \uf029cHome \uf0f6\uf0f7\uf0f7 \uf02b\uf079 \uf0f6\uf0f7\uf0f7\uf0281 \uf02d cCont \uf028t \uf029\uf029 \uf02d\uf065E1dt \uf0e8 k \uf03d1 \uf0e7\uf0e8 k \uf03d1 \uf0f8 \uf0f8iftIso1 \uf0a3 t \uf0a3 tIso2if tIso1 \uf0a3 t \uf0a3 tIso2andandif t \uf03c tIso1ort \uf03e tIso2nIk \uf03d1nIk \uf03d1\uf0e5 pSick Ik \uf028t \uf029 \uf0a3 Qmax\uf0e5 pSick Ik \uf028t \uf029 \uf03e QmaxNumber of individual s in the symptomatic period Ik \uf0280\uf029 \uf03d 0\uf0281 \uf0a3 k \uf0a3 nP \uf029\uf0281 \uf0a3 k \uf0a3 nI \uf029ParametersNew infections in interval [t1,t2 ]New sick individual s in interval [t1,t2 ] \uf03d \uf0f2 pSick \uf06a P \uf028t \uf029 dtnP\uf03d pSick \uf0e5 Ik \uf028t \uf029nI\uf03d pSick pHosp \uf0e5 Ik \uf028t \uf029\uf03d pSick pHosp pICU \uf0e5 Ik \uf028t \uf029nINew deaths in interval [t1,t2 ]\uf03d \uf0f2 pSick pDeath \uf067 InI \uf028t \uf029 dtNew consultati ons in interval [t1,t2 ]\uf03d \uf0f2 pSick pConsult \uf06a PnP \uf028t \uf029 dtNew hospitalizations in interval [t1,t2 ] \uf03d \uf0f2 pSick pHosp \uf06a P \uf028t \uf029 dtnPNew ICU admissions in interval [t1,t2 ] \uf03d \uf0f2 pSick pHosp pICU \uf06a P \uf028t \uf029 dtnPt2\uf03d \uf0f2t1t2t1t2t1t2t1t2t1t2t1SARS-CoV-2 infections which are brought into the country may not be detected and may spreadwithout being noticed because the symptoms of COVID-19 may easily be confused with otherinfluenza-like illnesses (ILI). Few practitioners may decide to order a SARS-CoV-2 test for whatthey regard a normal ILI patient while no community-transmitted cases in the population have beenreported. If we assume that fraction of pTest ILI patients who (a) seek medical help or who (b) arehospitalized or who (c) die from the disease are tested for SARS-Cov-2, then the probability that notone single test has been performed on a COVID-19 patient by time t despite the ongoingtransmission in the population is given by:\uf0281 \uf02d pTest \uf029 \uf0f20t PnP \uf028\uf074 \uf029\uf06a pSick \uf028pConsult \uf02b p Hosp \uf02b pDeath \uf029d\uf074 .The probability that at least one test has been performed (and has returned a positive result) is then1 \uf02d \uf0281 \uf02d pTest \uf029 \uf0f20t PnP \uf028\uf074 \uf029\uf06a pSick \uf028pConsult \uf02b p Hosp \uf02b pDeath \uf029d\uf074 .Parameters used in the modelling with CovidSIM10 per We assumed that the first cases with subsequent silent transmission beganday (from on 15 February when nine European countries had cases. For the whole15 course of the one year simulation, we assumed an average of 10 infectedFebruary) people per day were arriving in the hypothetical country from othercountries (e.g., by legal and/or illegal crossing of land borders).by Imperial College at \u201ctwo thirds of cases being sufficiently symptomatic toself-isolate\u201d [3]. Of note is that another modelling study used a 50% value[15]. Nevertheless, some proportion of asymptomatic cases is consistentwith the findings of a very large Chinese study [12] , where 81% of cases ofWe used the default value in the CovidSIM model, which is based onmedical consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI). During a pandemicthere might be a shift away from face-to-face consultations with healthworkers, so that some of these consultations may be either telephone orinternet-based. This parameter is not used for determining subsequentoutcomes like hospitalisations and deaths. We further assume that casesonly seek medical help once.This estimate is highly uncertain. We have multiplied by 5 the percentagewhich has been observed for seasonal influenza in Germany (0.2%), toaccount for the apparent increased severity of COVID-19. The highuncertainty for this parameter is due to the likely under-diagnosis of mildcases in many settings (impacting the size of the denominator). It also mayvary between countries given the use of hospital facilities to isolate mildcases. Modellers in the United Kingdom (UK) have used 4.4% (of allinfected cases) [3], and for modelling in the United States 3%, 5% and 12%have been proposed [16]. The length of hospitalisation was assumed to be10 days which is similar to other modelling work e.g., 10.4 days for the UK[3].\u201csevere\u201d cases (i.e., 4.7%/(13.8% + 4.7%) = 25.4%) [12]. This is similar tothe Chinese case series reported by Wang et al. at 26.1% [17].30% \u201cbased on early reports from COVID-19 cases in the UK\u201d [3].Given the relatively high quality of the healthcare systems in Europe, weconsidered the lower end of the range reported by the WHO for the infectionfatality risk (IFR) of 0.3% to 1% (based on 3 publications) [21]. This IFR wasthen adjusted by the proportion assumed to be symptomatic (at 67%, asabove) to give a case fatality risk (CFR) of 0.45% (i.e., 0.3% x 100%/67% =0.45%). Nevertheless, we note that higher estimates exist, including a CFRfor \u201cChina outside of Hubei Province\u201d of 0.81% (95%CI: 0.67 to 0.98; andadjusted for the time delay in reporting deaths) [22]. Another CFR for \u201cChinaoutside of Hubei Province\u201d was similar, at 0.9% (95% credible interval:0.6On 6 March 2020, the WHO reported that this number was likely to be in therange of 2.0 to 2.5 [24]. But given persisting uncertainty, we used the samethree values as in the modelling work by Hellewell et al [2]. Of note is thatan earlier review of 12 studies [25], suggested estimates that ranged fromseem to have stabilised at around 2\u20133. Recent UK modelling used anestimate of 2.4 (range: 2.0 to 2.6) [3].recent UK modelling [3]. This has biological plausibility as while there issimilarity in viral loads between asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19patients [26], it would be expected that those who are fully symptomatic(with a cough etc.) would be more likely to transmit infection. Of note is anestimate from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, that 17.9% ofstandard deviation of 25% (calculated using 16 stages; Erlang distribution).assumed value for influenza (SD = 25%, Erlang distribution).onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6weeks for patients with severe or critical disease\u201d [8]. But given that mildcases may have been missed in this particular assessment, we used aslightly shorter time period of 10 days (SD = 25%, Erlang distribution).different interventions: people may adopt enhanced personal hygienemeasures (hand washing, cough etiquette etc.); they may decide to havefewer contacts (physical distancing); and governments may close venuesand schools, restrict mass transit, curtail mass gatherings, and restrict travel(within and between countries).This date is somewhat arbitrary but does represent a time of increasedawareness of the disease in Europe as there were 9 European countrieshaving reported cases to WHO and one reporting a death (in France).
