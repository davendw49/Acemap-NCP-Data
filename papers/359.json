The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken. On 31 December 2019, China notified an outbreak pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City to the World Health Organization (WHO) and it had been identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In January 2020, several cases were confirmed outside the Mainland of China and hence WHO has declared 2019-nCoV as a global health emergency. Approximately one month since the notification to the WHO, there were 24,663 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases worldwide where 29 countries were affected. January 25 in Malaysia, the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported the first three confirmed cases of whom are of China nationality. The three infected patients were reported to have entered Malaysia from Singapore of which two days earlier, a confirmed case was notified by the Singapore authorities. The first infected Malaysian was reported on February 4. Based on the patient mobility report prior to the notification, it was noted that he was in Singapore for a week starting on January 16, 2020 to attend an international conference where some of the conference delegates were reported to have come from China. It was noted that this patient's symptoms appear on 23 January and he only seek for treatment on January 29 and was referred to the Sungai Buloh Hospital on February 2. The current understanding of the 2019-nCoV is that there is a possibility that the novel coronavirus can be asymptomatic. Thus, this paper aims to add insights into the epidemiology of 2019-nCoV by simulating the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV in Malaysia when one local human was infected.", "text": "(c) It is assumed that the 2019-nCoV is able to transmit between human to human.The compartmental model is thus depicted in Figure 1. Since the patient zero may be infectious and wasmobile and freely interacting then susceptible human becomes exposed with the disease at a transmissionrate f. Once exposed, the incubation period starts and then after the period ends then those exposed movesto the Infected compartment at a rate c and when they recovered from the disease then they will move tothe Recovered compartment at a rate k. However, there are some infected cases who may die due to thedisease with the given rate of d.The differential equations (equations (1) \u2013 (4)) which describe the dynamics of the 2019-nCoV in humanpopulations are formulated based on the compartmental diagram described earlier in Figure 1.!\" &\"',!# = \u2212 (!)!# =&\"'( \u2212 ,!!#' =  \u2212  \u2212 ,!0!# = .The descriptions of the parameters and their values used for the simulation is shown in Table 1.Total human populationIncubation Period326000006.51.073.6First confirmed infectious Malaysian is onset on January 23, 2020 when he came back from Singapore [4].Hence the initial time (t0) is set to January 23, 2020 and I0 is 1. E0 and R0 are assigned to 0. Matlab 2019 isused in this study to simulate the SEIR model formulated using the parameter values listed in Table 1.Figure 2 depicts the simulation of the SEIR model for the first ten days since the on-set date. Based on theresult, the number of cases will increase to two persons which indicate that the second case will beconfirmed on t = 8.74 which is approximately on the 9th day after on-set date of the first case, that is on the1st February 2020.In figure 3, the simulation is run for 300 days and it is observed that if there is no control measure takenthen the disease will run its course from the on-set date of the first case until day t = 100 when the maximumnumber of infected cases are reached. This means that if there is no control intervention imposed on thesituation then the disease will be able to infect more than 3 million in the country.The 2019-nCoV SEIR model was simulated using the parameters values obtained from trusted sources. Themodel is found to be accurate as it is able to predict the second confirmed case in Malaysia as reported onFebruary 7 by the MoH [5]. One of the parameters used, namely the incubation period, was actuallyestimated by [2] based on 88 confirmed cases detected outside of Wuhan, China. Our simulation hasmanaged to verify the proposed incubation period of 6.5 days at which according to the MoH report [5],the second case has developed symptoms on the 1st February 2020 which is in agreement with the predictionof our model. We have also shown through the simulation the seriousness of the spread of the disease ifthere is no control measure is taken.1.", "ref_list": [[], ["bul_id=YkdwYk ZYOVQ5WFJ4dXhEelNpbGRmZz09&menu_id=L0pheU43NWJwRWVSZklWdzQ4TlhUU T09"], ["The incubation period of 2019-nCoV infections among travellers from Wuhan, China"], ["Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions"], ["(2020, Feb 4).
