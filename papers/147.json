Then it has been reported in morethan 20 countries and regions overseas rapidly. More than eighty thousand cases havebeen infected, resulting in more than three thousand deaths. Due to the limitation ofnucleic acid detection, many clinical suspected cases cannot be diagnosed in time.We used automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serum IgM and IgGantibodies to 2019-nCoV of 736 subjects including confirmed Corona Virus Disease2019 (COVID-19) patients, non-COVID-19 fever patients, other disease patients andmedical staff as well as healthy people. The dynamic process of antibody production inCOVID-19 disease progression were analyzed, and the value of antibody detection inthe laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 were evaluated.COVID-19 patients were becoming reactive(positive) for specific anti-2019-nCoVIgM antibodies from 7-12 days after the onset of morbidity, followed closely by theIgG. The levels of specific IgM and IgG antibodies increased with the progression ofthe disease. The trend of IgM and IgG changes in different cases is not exactly the same.The levels of IgM and IgG and their distributions in different groups were different withthat of healthy people. The areas under the ROC curves for IgM and IgG to diagnoseCOVID-19 were 0.988 and 1.000, respectively.Specific IgM or IgG antibody detection had good sensitivity and specificity for thediagnosis of suspected fever cases. Detection of specific antibodies in patients withfever can be a good distinction between COVID-19 and other diseases in low epidemicarea.Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses,which are widely distributed in humans and other mammals. Coronaviruses usuallycause respiratory, digestive and nervous system diseases in humans and animals[1].In the past 20 years, coronavirus has caused two global epidemics of severe respiratoryinfectious diseases, one of which was severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2, 3]in Guangdong Province of China from 2002 to 2003. The other was the Middle EastRespiratory Syndrome\uff08Middle East respiratory syndrome , MERS\uff09 outbreak in SaudiArabia in 2012. [4].Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. Then it spread rapidly nationwide.At the same time, more than 20 countries and regions overseas have reported forinfected cases. As of 24:00 on February 29th, 2020, a total of 79824 confirmedCOVID19casesand2870deathshavebeenreportedinml).Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the China National Health Commission haspublished the \u201cNovel coronavirus pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program\u201d andhas revised it several times along with the actual situation of the progress of theepidemic[5-9]. In addition to having a history of epidemiology, clinical signs andimaging characteristics of viral pneumonia, an important diagnostic criterion forCOVID-19 patients is their positive 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test result of nasal andpharyngeal swab [5-9]. However, in the actual diagnosis and treatment, the sensitivityof nucleic acid detection was not ideal enough. Only 30-50% of the confirmedCOVID19 cases had positive results, moreover, in some confirmed case, nucleic acid testingoften took four or more tests to get a positive result. It is necessary to use a fast andconvenient method to realize the rapid diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection.After the virus infects the organism, the immune system carries on the immunedefense to the virus and produces the specific antibody. In the laboratory diagnosis ofinfectious diseases, the detection of specific antibodies to pathogens is a sensitivemethod for fast diagnosis. However, how the 2019-nCoV antibody produced andchanged during COVID-19 progression is still unclear.In this study, we used automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serumIgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV, to understand the process of antibodyproduction in disease progression, and to evaluate the value of antibody detection in thelaboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.The study was conducted in accordance with the International Coordinating Councilfor Clinical Trials and the Helsinki Declaration, and was approved by the HospitalEthics Review Committee (Ethics No 2020PS038K), and the patient's informed consentwas exempted.A total of 736 subjects were included in the study. 228 suspected COVID-19 caseswere admitted to the fever clinic from January 21, 2020 to February 16, 2020 inShengjing Hospital of Chinese Medical University, which is the designated hospital forCOVID-19 in Liaoning Province. All of 228 cases were observed quarantine admissionand taken the nasal and pharyngeal swab for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid testing. Accordingto the \u201cNovel coronavirus pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program\u201d[8], 3 caseswith positive result for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection were recorded as COVID-19group. The other 225 cases that had twice negative result for the 2019-nCoV nucleicacid detection were named non-COVID-19 group.Another 222 outpatients with other diseases in the same period, 63 medical staffsworked for fever clinic and 223 healthy physical examinees in 2018 were collected andwere named other disease group, medical staff group and health control group,respectively.Clinical Data Collection According to the unified form, two residents collectedclinical data from medical records separately.Blood sampling Fasting venous blood (5ml) was collected from all the subjects andput into the yellow head vacuum tube containing separation gel. After centrifugation,the serum samples were stored at-20 \u2103.2019-nCoV nucleic acid detectionNasopharynx/oropharynx swab samples werecollected by regional Center for Disease Control. Fluorescence Reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of open readingframe 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) in 2019-nCoV genome.Nucleocapsidic protein (N) was detected. The CT value of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid testresults should be interpreted according to the recommendations of the manufacturer'sinstructions, and the suspicious results should be notified for clinical re-sampling andre-examination. In order to be diagnosed as positive in laboratory test results, it isnecessary to meet the standard that 2019-nCoV ORF1ab and N gene of same sampleshows at least one target specific RT-PCR test result is positive.The diagnosis was made according to the \u201cNovel coronavirus pneumoniaDiagnosis and Treatment Program (Revised version of the trial fifth edition) \u201d[8]published by China National Health Commission.2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibody detectionChemiluminescence detection kit from Shenzhen Yahuilong Biotechnology Co Ltdwas used to detect 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibody. Magnetic particle coatedantigens including 2019-nCoV envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N antigen.iFlash 3000 automatic chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer from ShenzhenYahuilong Biotechnology Co Ltd. All operations are carried out after strict calibrationand quality control in accordance with the operator\u2019s instructions. The results werereported by relative luminescence intensity (RLU). There was a positive correlationbetween the amount of 2019-nCoV IgM or IgG antibody in the sample and RLU, andthe concentration of 2019-nCoV IgM or IgG antibody (AU/ml) was automaticallycalculated according to RLU and built-in calibration curve, and 10.0 AU/ml wasregarded as reactive (positive).SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and GraphPad Prism version 5.01(GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) were used for statistical analyses.Quantitative variables were expressed as median (P99). The normality of variables wastested using Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. and LDS-t-test for comparison among groups.A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted to evaluate the diagnosticperformance and correlations determined by Spearman's rank correlation. Z test wasused to compare AUC between two groups. All tests were two sided and P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.Of the 3 cases of confirmed case, 2 were male and 1 was female. The age rangedfrom 39 to 57 years. 2 patients had diabetes and hypertension respectively. 1 was acommon case, 2 were severe cases. 1 case had history of Wuhan contact and the other2 cases had no clear epidemiological history.The main laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients were normal or slightly lowwhite blood cells and lymphocytes, elevated inflammatory indicators such asinterleukin-6, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, erythrocytesedimentation rate; and normal myocardial markers.The production of anti-2019-nCoV antibodies after the onset of morbidity is shownin figure 1. Three COVID-19 patients were becoming reactive(positive) for specificanti-2019-nCoV antibodies from 7-12 days after the onset of morbidity, and the levelsof anti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies increased with the progression of thedisease. Closed followed with the production of anti-2019-nCoV IgM antibody, theproduction of anti-2019-nCoV IgG antibody is also rapid. Of the 3 cases, 1 casedeveloped anti-2019-nCoV IgG 1 day later than IgM, and the other 2 cases developedanti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgG almost on the same day. However, in different cases, thechanges of anti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgG were not completely consistent, case 2showed that the level of anti-2019-nCoV IgG was continue higher than that of IgM, andthe other two cases showed that the level of anti-2019-nCoV IgM increased more thanthat of IgG from 2 weeks of morbidity.As shown in table 4, in non-COVID-19, other disease, medical staff and healthcontrol groups, there were a few cases reactive for 2019-nCoV IgM and IgG, all thecases were single reactive for IgM or IgG. The sensitivities of IgM and IgG were 100%,as for specificities of IgM and IgG were all over 97%.Of 225 non-COVID-19 cases, 2 cases were detectable for influenza A RNA and 2cases were detectable for influenza B RNA, respectively, 4 cases were detectable foradenovirus DNA, 17 cases were detectable for mycoplasma pneumonia DNA.We also compared the anti-2019-nCoV antibodies values distributions in differentgroups. As shown in table4 and figure 2, the anti-2019-nCoV IgM levels innonCOVID-19 was higher than that of healthy control group, the difference wasstatistically significant.In order to further clarify the diagnostic efficacy of specific IgM and IgG in feversuspected COVID-19 patients, we made the ROC curve of anti-2019-nCoV IgM andIgG(figure 3). The area under the curve was 0.988 and 1.000, and the best cut-off valuewas 10.14and 15.99, respectively.With China's growing surveillance network and laboratory capacity, the outbreakwas identified within a few weeks and the viral genome sequence was announced [10],effectively promoting in vitro diagnostic tests. At present, the main diagnostic methodis to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid by real-time quantitative fluorescent PCR.In the early stage of this epidemic, due to the insufficient production of nucleicacid detection kits and the high requirement of technical norms for nucleic aciddetection, the application of nucleic acid testing as a diagnostic standard was limited,and not all suspected patients could be tested in time for definite diagnosis. With theefforts of China State Drug Administration, seven 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detectionreagents have been urgent approved to be marketed. It effectively alleviated theproblem that the lack of reagents in the epidemic prevention and control. At mean time,with the number of COVID-19 cases increased, physicians found that only 30-50% ofconfirmed cases tested positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid, which means there was alarge part of patient had missing detection of nucleic acid. The factors owing to thismissing include the timing of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal specimens\u2019 collection;improper collection site, such as the collection depth was not enough; the urgent launchof a large number of in vitro diagnostic reagents inevitably leads to the lack of largesample virus genome research and clinical validation; standardized clinical nucleic acidtesting laboratory was still a limitation to all labs. Furthermore, in the course ofCOVID-19\u2019s different stages, the virus load is different. When the body's immunesystem produces antibodies, the clinical signs and symptoms is obvious, the virus islikely to decline without being detected.Recently, a study of 138 patients showed a high proportion (41%) of suspectednosocomial infection [11], and it is also noteworthy that the presence of asymptomaticpatients with latent mild pneumonia may be an important source of infection foroutbreak transmission [12]. Therefore, it remains critical to apply a fast and convenientdetection method to distinguish and trace suspicious case or contacts as early as possiblein order to prevent super-transmission events.Antibodies are the products of humoral immune response after infection withviruses. As a new infectious disease, while the detection of nucleic acid cannot be usedwidely, specific antibodies to 2019-nCoV can be used to determine whether the patienthas been recently infected with 2019-nCoV or not. It is especially helpful for thediagnosis of suspected patients with negative nucleic acid detection. The operationrequirement of antibody detection in clinical laboratory is lower than that of nucleicacid detection, which can be detected quickly and in large quantities, and can becompleted in common P2 Biosafety Laboratory. Therefore, in suspected cases or closecontact, antibody testing can be used as a useful complement to nucleic acid testing toreduce the exposure risks of respiratory tract samples collected by medical staffs. It hasbeen reported that serum samples from 5 patients were detected by self-made2019nCoV IgG and IgM ELISA kits, and the antigen could cover 92% of the 2019-nCoVGenerally speaking, the immune response of pathogenic microorganisms is usuallystimulated by the rise of IgM after infection, IgG usually appears 1-2 weeks after IgM,and has been rising and maintaining high levels in the body for a long time. BecauseCOVID-19 is a new infectious disease and the immunological test reagent has just beendeveloped, there is still no report on how IgM and IgG antibodies were produced anddeveloped after 2019-nCoV infection.In our study, we found that specific antibodies reactive to 2019-nCoV appearedfrom 7-12days after the onset of morbidity in all 3 patients. Unlike previous experiencethat IgG usually appears 1-2 weeks after IgM, the presence of anti-2019-nCoV IgMantibodies in COVID-19 cases was followed by the presence of anti-2019-nCoV IgGantibodies within a very short period of time (about 0~1 day), followed by asimultaneous rise in both antibodies. However, the rising speeds of anti-2019-nCoVIgG and IgM antibodies were different in different individuals. It was very interestingto find that the case2, who had the mildest clinical signs and symptoms among the 3COVID-19 patients, was the earliest patient to show the specific anti-2019-nCoVantibodies on 7th day of morbidity, his anti-2019-nCoV IgM value was relative lowerbut IgG value was relative higher in the following days ; on the other hand, Case 3, whohad the severest clinical signs and symptoms among the 3 COVID-19 patients, was thelatest patient to show the reactivity to anti-2019-nCoV on the 12th day of morbidity, andthe value of anti-2019-nCoV IgM antibodies continued to increase.2019-nCoV is highly infectious and the population is generally susceptible to2019-nCoV.The most common symptoms after infection include fever, fatigue, drycough, and muscle pain, with expiratory dyspnoea occurring in more than half ofpatients[14]. Severe cases are prone to rapidly progress to acute respiratory distresssyndrome, septic shock, high risk of admission to intensive care units, and even death.Therefore, how to closely observe the condition after morbidity and find severe casesas soon as possible is the key to reduce the mortality of critically ill patients. Accordingto our findings, it seems that the time and speed of production of specificanti-2019nCoV IgM antibodies correlate with disease severity. But because the number of casesis so small, more research is needed to confirm it.In addition to COVID-19, the fever patient of non-COVID-19, other disease,medical staffs and healthy controls were also studied. Non-COVID-19 group includedseveral other respiratory viruses such as influenza A, B and adenovirus infection cases,these cases were negative for anti-2019-nCoV specific antibody detection, indicatingthat the antibody detection has a good ability to resist interference and differentialdiagnosis of different respiratory virus infections. Among each groups, onlyCOVID19 patients were all positive for both anti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgG antibodies, whilein other populations, the IgG or IgM antibodies were single positive in a very few cases.However, combined with the results of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection and clinicaldata, they were judged to be a false positive of IgM or IgG. Considering thatCOVID19 has broken out in many countries around the world, more than 80000 people havebeen diagnosed and the number is growing rapidly, the main problem at present is theneed for highly sensitive tests to screen the suspected cases and to prevent misseddiagnosis by nucleic acid tests, lower false positive rates for antibody testing areacceptable. In the meantime, simultaneous positive of anti-2019-nCoV IgM and IgGwill be helpful to improve the specificity. Dynamic monitoring of IgM and IgGantibody to 2019-nCoV is an effective means and a good complement to the problemthat nucleic acid missed detection for screening suspected cases.To our knowledge, little has been reported about the specific antibody productionprocess in the course of COVID-19 disease, and little has been reported about thedifferent situation of antibodies in fever non-COVID-19 population, other diseases,special contact population such as medical staff and healthy population. This studyprovides data on the regularity of antibody production in the course of COVID-19, andprovides some understanding of the basic data of specific antibodies in differentpopulations. The results of this study help to provide evidence for rapid screening ofsuspected cases through the serological testing to curb the rapid progress of theepidemic globally. Just on the day of this manuscript was submitted, the China NationalHealth Commission published the new edition of \u201cNovel coronavirus pneumoniaDiagnosis and Treatment Program\u201d[15], in which suggested that positive ofanti-2019nCoV IgM and IgG can be used as a standard to determine the diagnosis, supported ourfindings.This study still has some limitations. First, only 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases wereincluded, and although the continuous dynamic process of anti-2019-nCoV antibodyproduction and its relationship with disease progression have been carefully observed,a large sample of cases is still needed for verification. Second, changes inanti-2019nCoV antibodies were only tracked for 4 to 20 days after the morbidity, with nolongerterm observation. However, the trend of anti-2019-nCoV IgG and IgM antibodiesproduction from beginning to increasing has been preliminarily found. Third,anti2019-nCoV nucleic acid testing has not all been performed in every groups,asymptomatic infections may be missed in other disease group, which might have acertain impact on the evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy of antibodies. Consideringthat Liaoning Province, where this study was conducted, is a low epidemic area, thepossibility of asymptomatic infection would be very small.In this paper, we studied the producing process of specific antibody in patientswith COVID-19, compared and evaluated the diagnostic value of antibody in differentpopulations, which is beneficial for doctors to use in the process of diagnosis andtreatment. As a useful complement to nucleic acid detection\uff0cthe detection of specificanti-2019-nCoV antibodies will be able to draw a more comprehensive, rapid andaccurate diagnosis to COVID-19, so as to effectively distinct between COVID andnonCOVID-19 patients and curb the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV in the global epidemicperiod.This study was funded by \u201cthe National Science and Technology Major Project of China(2018ZX10302205)\u201d,\u201cLiaoningProject(20180550523)\u201d, \u201cLiaoning Province Central Government's special project toguide local scientific and technological development (2019JH6/10400009)\u201d,\u201cGuangdong Province Major key projects of industrial technology (201902010003)\u201d,\u201cMajor Special Project of Construction Program of China Medical University in2018(112/3110118034)\u201d and \u201c345 talent project\u201d of Shengjing Hospital of ChinaMedical University.
