Therehavebeen79,331laboratory-confirmed cases and 2,595 deaths globally as of February 25th, 2020respiratory diseases including SARS and MERS.and the impact of comorbidities on the clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.What this study adds?patients. Comorbidities of COVID-19 mainly included hypertension, cardiovascular diseases,chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency.(admission to intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death) of COVID-19.COVID-19 on hospital admission.IntroductionSince November 2019, the rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which arosedeaths globally as of February 25th, 2020 [2].The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are, according to the latest reports [3-8], largelycoronavirus (MERS-CoV) [16-24], COVID-19 more readily predisposed to respiratory failure andthese limitations is needed to explore for the factors underlying the adverse impact of COVID-19.the subpopulations with poorer prognosis.MethodsData sources and data extractionst sthospitalized cases from 575 hospitals between November 21 , 2019 and January 31 , 2020. TheConfirmedcasesdenotedthepatientswhosehigh-throughput sequencingor real-timeswab specimens were positive [3]. See Online Supplement for details.The clinical data (including recent exposure history, clinical symptoms and signs, comorbidities,clinicians, who subsequently entered the data into a computerizeddatabase for furthercross-checking. Manifestations on chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) was summarized bypneumonia because of its global acceptance [26].Comorbidities were determined based on patient\u2019s self-report on admission. Comorbidities wereorgan system (i.e. coronary heart disease, hypertension) would be merged into a single category.The primary endpoint of our study was a composite measure which consisted of the admissioncomposite endpoints.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were conducted with SPSS software version 23.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). No formalCOVID-19. Nonetheless, our sample size was deemed sufficient to power the statistical analysisbeing reported.Patient and public involvementinterpretation of data, or asked to advise on writing up of the report.ResultsDemographic and clinical characteristicswere females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patientshospitalization (88.0%), followed by dry cough (70.2%). Fatigue (42.8%) and productive cough(36.0%) were less common. At least one abnormal chest CT manifestation (including ground-glasscomposite endpoints during the study (Table 1).Presence of comorbidities and the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19Of the 1,590 cases, 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most commoncomorbidities encompassed hypertension (269 [16.9%]), diabetes (130 [8.2%]), and cardiovasculardiseases (59 [3.7%]). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was identified in 24 cases. Attended to have abnormal chest X-ray manifestations (29.2% vs. 15.1%) (Table 1).Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 stratified by the number of comorbiditieswith patients who had single comorbidity (Table 2).Clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 stratified by organ systems of comorbiditiesA total of 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18(1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovasculardiseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, COPD, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy andimmunodeficiency, respectively. Severe cases were more likely to have hypertension (32.7% vs.diabetes (34.6% vs. 14.3%), hepatitis B infections (32.1% vs. 15.7%), COPD (62.5% vs. 15.3%),chronic kidney diseases (38.1% vs. 15.7%) and malignancy (50.0% vs. 15.6%) compared withexposure history of Wuhan as compared with those without (all P<0.05) (Table 3).Prognostic analyseswithout (Table 3).Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to thepatients with COPD (HR 2.68, 95%CI 1.42-5.05), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45),hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were morewithout comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least onecomorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities (Figure 2).Discussionrepresentativeness of the whole patient population in China.outcomes in patients with avian influenza [10-14], SARS-CoV [15] and MERS-CoV infectionsrespiratory outbreaks, comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension andmalignancymechanistic studies.taken into account when predicting the prognosis in patients with COVID-19.would help provide with this susceptible population better personal medical protection.The main limitation of our study was the self-report of comorbidities on admission.comorbidities and the poor clinical outcomes.Conclusionsstratification of patients with COVID-19 upon hospital admission.for analysis and the medical staffs working in the front line.StatementsAllauthorshavecompletedtheICMJEuniformdisclosureformhave influenced the submitted work.behalfofallauthors,aworldwidelicence(http://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/BMJ%20Author%20Licence%20March%202013.doc) to theopenaccessbasis(withauthorsbeingaskedtopayanopenaccessare set out in our worldwide licence referred to above.1.
