As well as in humans, corona\u00adviruses are widespread in other species worldwide,including birds, rabbits, reptiles, cats, dogs, pigs,monkeys, and bats. They can cause respiratory, enteric,hepatic, and neurological diseases of variable severity,and are sometimes fatal in humans.5,6 Two of thepreviously identified strains of coronaviruses\u2014severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u00ad CoV)and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS\u00ad CoV)\u2014have caused widespread epidemics andare zoonotic in origin.7,8 2019\u00ad nCoV is also likely tohave a zoonotic origin. Early confirmed cases of thenew coronavirus in Wuhan were closely linked to theHuanan seafood market (a wet market),1,9,10 where alarge variety of vertebrate and invertebrate animals,wild caught and farm raised, are sold. Right after theoficial confirmation of the close linkage between severepneumonia and the game animals in the market, it wasclosed on Jan 1, 2020.The practice of consuming meat and products of wildanimals in China dates back to prehistoric times. Inmodern times, although game is not needed for food,the tradition of eating it persists. In China, especially inthe southeastern part where Guangdong and Wuhanare located, game is a favourable delicacy on everyday Published Onlinemenus.

Huang Di Nei Jing Su Wen (The Yellow choarsrbeceteendcvoerrrseicotnedfi.rTshteEmperor\u2019s Internal Classics) from the Hang dynasty appeared at thelancet.(206 BC\u2013220 AD) states \u201c[of things] eaten when hungry cFoebmr/uianrfyec2t6io,n20o2n0is food, eaten when ill is medicine\u201d and is consideredan early reflection of the homology. However, throughnot being able to fully comprehend the essence of thephilosophy, many Chinese people mistakenly extendthe scope of the homology and simply think that oneis made of the supplements they eat. For instance,kidney and penis of deer or tiger are believed to haveaphrodisiac efect, and brain of fish or monkey aresupposed to make people brighter.Another false belief often held is that meat andproducts from wild animals have certain therapeuticefects. For example, Chinese pangolin meat is believedto help relieve rheumatism, its blood is believed topromote blood circulation and remove meridianobstruction (a concept in traditional Chinese medicine),and its bile is believed to eliminate so\u00ad called liver fire(irascibility) and improve eyesight.        Behaviours seen on the internet may have alsoencouraged the spread of the 2019\u00ad nCoV. On popularlivestream platforms such as Kuaishou and Douyin,hosts engage in so\u00ad called mukbangs, which involvehosts eating food in front of their audience. Sometimesthe food they eat is strange or dangerous.        Eating of other wild animals, such as African snail, frog,bamboo rat, or octopus, has also been broadcasted.Sometimes the animals are eaten raw or even alive,especially octopuses, despite the possibility that theseare infected with various viruses.Instead of attempting to control outbreaks ofzoonotic viral diseases such as SARS, MERS, Ebola, and2019\u00ad nCoV after the fact, the key is to interrupt theiremergence by refraining from game, with legislationbeing only part of the solution. The ultimate solutionlies in changing people\u2019s minds about what is delicious,trendy, prestigious, or healthy to eat.In response to the outbreak of 2019\u00ad nCoV, theChinese Government has banned all forms of wildanimal transaction, and there are already spontaneouseforts on the internet to explain the risks involvedin consuming game, together with pleas to withholdfrom buying, selling, or consuming wild animals. Webelieve that through a change in the outdated andinappropriate tradition of consuming wild animals andtheir products, we can conserve the natural habitat ofwild animals, and humans and other living creatures cancoexist in harmony.Jie Li and Jun Li contributed equally to this work.
