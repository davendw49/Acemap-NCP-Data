Makhawi", "title": "Design of multi epitope-based peptide vaccine against E protein of human COVID-19: An immunoinformatics approach", "type": "preprint article", "abstract": "Background: on the late December 2019, a new endemic has been spread across Wuhan City, China; within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus designated as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a \u201cpublic-health emergency of international concern\u201d due to the rapid spreading and increasing worldwide. There is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; therefore, the objective of this paper is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against 2019-nCoV using immunoinformatics approach. Method: We will highlight a technique facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach with comparative genomic approach to determine our potential target for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in 2019-nCoV strain; in addition, 10 MHC1 and MHC2 related peptides were promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99% respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for 2019nCoV using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine rapidly needs to validates clinically to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to assist on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.", "text": "        In the last few decades, there were six strains of coronaviruses, but in                Phylogenetic analysis in        The core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method tosynthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and caninduce specific immune responses. B-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked witha T-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. The T-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments(8-20 amino acids), whereas the B-cell epitopes can be proteins.[26, 27] As far we know,this is the first study to design a multi epitope-based peptide vaccine against using animmunoinformatics approach. Rapid further studies are recommended to prove theefficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection.2. Materials and Methods:        The full genebank files of complete genomes an        In silico analysis software for visualization of comparisons between complete genomesequences and associated annotations.[28] To identify regions of similarity,rearrangements, insertions and at any level from base-pair differences to the wholegenome. It\u2019s available at(https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis-comparisontool-act ).        The first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. It allowsantigen classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins withoutrecourse to sequence alignment. It predicts the probability of the antigenicity one ormultiple of protein based on auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation of proteinsequence. Structural Co        It is a software package proposed to stream a distinct program that can run nearly anysequence operation as well as a few basic alignment investigations. Thesequences of E protein were retrieved from UniProt run it by BioEdit to determine if theconserved sites through ClustalW in the application settings.[30]MEGA (version 10.1.6) is software for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. It isused for pairwise and multiple sequences alignment alongside construction and analysisof phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships. The gap penalty was 15 for openingand 6.66 for extending the gap for both pairwise and multiple sequences alignment.Bootstrapping of 300 was used in construction of maximum like hood phylogenetictree.[31, 32] It's available at: (https://www.megasoftware.net ).IEDB tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mer sequence) from HLAclass I and class II T-cell epitopes by using artificial neural network (ANN)approach.[33-35] while HLA-II T-cell epitopes were recognized by using NN-alignapproach.[36] For the binding analysis, all the alleles were carefully chosen, andthe length was set at 10 before prediction was done. Analysis of epitopes binding toMHC-I molecules was assessed by the IEDB MHC-I prediction server at(http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/ ). Artificial Neural Network (ANN) version 2.2 was chosen asPrediction method as it depends on the median inhibitory concentration (IC50)[33, 37-39]the selected candidates were evaluated by the IEDB MHC-II prediction tool at(http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/). All Conserved Immunodominant peptides at score equal orless than 100 median inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were selected for additionalanalysis while epitopes with IC50 greater than 100 were eliminated.[40]Population coverage for each epitope was carefully chosen by the IEDB populationcoverage calculation tool. The epitopes have diverse binding sites with different HLAalleles. Therefore, all the most promising epitope candidates were calculated forpopulation coverage against the whole world, China and Europe population to get andensure a universal vaccine.[41, 42] It\u2019s available at (http://tools.iedb.org/population/ )3D Modeling By using the reference sequence of E protein that has been obtained fromgene bank and use it as an input in RaptorX to predict the 3D structure of E protein;[43,44] then the visualization of the obtained 3D protein structure was done by UCSFChimera (version1.8).[45]vaccine prediction.The reference sequence of envelope protein was aligned with HCov-HKU1 referenceprotein using artemis comparison tool as illustrated in (Figure 1); then the mutatedprotein were tested for antigenicity where the envelope protein founded as the bestimmunogenic target by Vaxigen software.

It isused for pairwise and multiple sequences alignment alongside construction and analysisof phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships. The gap penalty was 15 for openingand 6.66 for extending the gap for both pairwise and multiple sequences alignment. Bootstrapping of 300 was used in construction of maximum like hood phylogenetictree.[31, 32] It's available at: (https://www.megasoftware.net ).IEDB tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mer sequence) from HLAclass I and class II T-cell epitopes by using artificial neural network (ANN)approach.[33-35] while HLA-II T-cell epitopes were recognized by using NN-alignapproach.[36] For the binding analysis, all the alleles were carefully chosen, andthe length was set at 10 before prediction was done. The epitopes have diverse binding sites with different HLAalleles."}
