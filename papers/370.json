However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drugrepurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs,could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In thisstudy, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementinga systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplaybetween the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-proteininteraction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%)among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope andnucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, havingthe sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV.Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions inthe human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putativerepurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, weprioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin,mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses ofdrug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines.Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plusdactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured bythe \u2018Complementary Exposure\u2019 pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-hostsubnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-proteininteractome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-basedmethodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potentialdrug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.        Coronaviruses (CoVs) typically affect the respiratory tract of mammals, includinghumans, and lead to mild to severe respiratory tract infections [1]. In the past 2 decades,two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with highmorbidity and mortality[        Although investment in biomedical and pharmaceutical research anddevelopment has increased significantly over the past two decades, the annual numberof new treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasremained relatively constant and limited[6]. A recent study estimated that pharmaceuticalcompanies spent $2.6 billion in 2015, up from $802 million in 2003, in the developmentof an FDA-approved new chemical entity drug[7]. Drug repurposing, represented as aneffective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the timeand reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinicaltrials[8-10]. However, experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly andtimeconsuming.[11] Computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses forsystematic drug repositioning[8-10, 12, 13]. However, traditional structure-based methodsare limited when three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which,unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition,targeting single virus proteins often have high risk of drug resistance by the rapidevolution of virus genomes [1].        Viruses (including HCoV) require host cellular factors for successful replicationduring infections[1]. Systematic identification of virus-host protein-protein interactions(PPIs) offers an effective way toward elucidation of the mechanisms of viral infection[14,15]. Subsequently, targeting cellular antiviral targets, such as virus-host interactome,may offer a novel strategy for the development of effective treatments for viralinfections[1], including SARS-CoV[16], MERS-CoV[16], Ebola virus[                In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodologythat combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform thatquantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in thehuman PPI network. The basis for these experiments rests on the notions that (i) theproteins that functionally associate with viral infection (including HCoV) are localized inthe corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human PPI network[                  To date, 7 pathogenic HCoVs (Figure 2A and 2B) have been found[                    HCoVs have five major protein regions for virus structure assembly and viralreplications[          Protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-nCoV was mostevolutionarily conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, theenvelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conservedregions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared toSARSCoV (Supplementary Table S2). However, the spike protein exhibited the lowestsequence conservation (sequence identity of 77%) between 2019-nCoV andSARSCoV. Meanwhile, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV only has 31.9% sequence identitycompared to MERS-CoV.First, we assembled the CoV-associated host proteins from 4 known HCoVs(SARSCoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), one mouse MHV, and one avian IBV(N protein) (Supplementary Table S3). In total, we obtained 119 host proteinsassociated with CoVs with various experimental evidences. Specifically, these hostproteins are either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or are involved in crucialpathways of HCoV infection. The HCoV-host interactome network is shown in Figure3A. We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1,with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins. KEGG pathwayenrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways (adjusted P value< 0.05), including measles, RNA transport, NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virusinfection, and influenza (Figure 3B). Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichmentanalyses further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (adjusted P value <0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology,viral process, positive regulation of viral life cycle, transport of virus, and virionattachment to host cell (Figure 3C). We then mapped the known drug-target network(see Methods) into the HCoV-host interactome to search for druggable, cellular targets.We found that 47 human proteins (39%, blue nodes in Figure 3A) can be targeted by atleast one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trial. For example, GSK3B,DPP4, SMAD3, PARP1, and IKBKB are the most targetable proteins. The highdruggability of HCoV-host interactome motivates us to develop a therapeutic strategy byspecifically targeting cellular proteins associated with HCoVs, such as drug repurposing.The basis for the proposed network-based drug repurposing methodologies rests on thenotions that the proteins that associate with and functionally govern a viral infection arelocalized in the corresponding subnetwork (Figure 1A) within the comprehensivehuman interactome network. For a drug with multiple targets to be effective against an          HCoV, its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of thecorresponding subnetwork in the human interactome (Figure 1), as we demonstrated inmultiple diseases [          In total, we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated (Z < -1.5and P < 0.05, permutation test) with the HCoV-host interactome (Figure 4A andSupplementary Table S4). To validate bias of the pooled cellular proteins from 6 CoVs,we further calculated the network proximities of all the drugs for 4 CoVs with a highenough number of know host proteins, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, andMHV, separately. We found that the Z-scores showed consistency among the pooled119 HCoV-associated proteins and other 4 individual CoVs (Figure 4B). The Pearsoncorrelation coefficients of the proximities of all the drugs for the pooled HCoV are 0.926vs. SARS-CoV (P < 0.001, t distribution), 0.503 vs. MERS-CoV (P < 0.001), 0.694 vs.IBV (P < 0.001), and 0.829 vs. MHV (P < 0.001). These network proximity analysesoffer putative repurposable candidates for potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs.          To further validate the 135 repurposable drugs against HCoVs, we first performed geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) using transcriptome data of MERS-CoV andSARSCoV infected host cells (see Methods). These transcriptome data were used as genesignatures for HCoVs. Additionally, we downloaded the expression data of drug-treatedhuman cell lines from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database [                    estrogen receptor has been shown to play a crucial role in inhibiting viral replication[                    with viral infection, including HCoVs[                    Immunosuppressant or antineoplastic agents. Previous studies haveconfirmed the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as the key factorin regulating various viruses\u2019 replications, including Andes orthohantavirus andcoronavirus[                    SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease which plays key roles inviral maturation and antagonism to interferon stimulation[                    Anti-inflammatory agents. Inflammatory pathways play essential roles in viralinfections[          In summary, our network proximity analyses offer multiple putative repurposabledrugs that target diverse cellular pathways for potential prevention and treatment ofHCoVs. However, further preclinical experiments and clinical trials are required to verifythe clinical benefits of these network-predicted candidates before clinical use.          Drug combinations, offering increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity, play animportant role in treating various viral infections[                    Sirolimus plus Dactinomycin. Sirolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR with bothantifungal and antineoplastic properties, has demonstrated to improves outcomes inpatients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure[                    Toremifene plus Emodin. Toremifene is the approved first generationnonsteroidal SERMs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer[                    Mercaptopurine plus Melatonin. As shown in Figure 5A, targets of bothmercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with HCoV-associatedhost proteins in the human interactome network. Recent in vitro and in vivo studiesidentified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV bytargeting papain-like protease [          In this study, we presented a network-based methodology for systematic identification ofputative repurposable drugs and drug combinations for potential treatment of HCoV.Integration of drug-target networks, HCoV-host interactions, HCoV-inducedtranscriptome in human cell lines, and human protein-protein interactome network areessential for such identification. Based on comprehensive evaluation, we prioritized 16putative repurposable drugs (Figure 5) and 3 putative drug combinations (Figure 6) forthe potential treatment of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV. However, all network-predictedrepurposable drugs and drug combinations must be validated in preclinical models andrandomized clinical trials before being used in patients.        We acknowledge several limitations in our current study. In this study, we used alow binding affinity value of 10 \u00b5M as a threshold to define a physical drug-targetinteraction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1\u00b5M) may be a moresuitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug-target network.Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large-scale, experimentallyreported drug-target networks from publicly available databases, the network data maybe incomplete and some drug-protein interactions may be functional associations,instead of physical bindings. We may use computational approaches to systematicallypredict the drug-target interactions further[                Owing to lack of the complete drug target information (such as the molecular\u2018promiscuity\u2019 of drugs), the dose-response and dose-toxicity effects for bothrepurposable drugs and drug combinations cannot be identified in current networkmodels. For example, Mesalazine, an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, isa top network-predicted candidate drug (Figure 5A) associated with HCoVs. Yet,several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia)associated with mesalazine usage [        In conclusion, this study offers a powerful, integrated network-based systemspharmacology methodology for rapid identification of repurposable drugs and drugcombinations for the potential treatment of HCoV. Our approach can minimize thetranslational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is asignificant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for theemerging 2019-nCoV outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, thenetwork tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for othertypes of virus and human diseases as well.          In total, we collected DNA sequences and protein sequences for 15 HCoVs, includingthree most recent 2019-nCoV genomes, from the NCBI GenBank database (January28, 2019, Supplementary Table S1). Whole genome alignment and protein sequenceidentity calculation were performed by Multiple Sequence Alignment in EMBL-EBIdatabase with default parameters. The neighbor joining (NJ) tree was computed fromthe pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix using MEGA X[                    We collected HCoV-host protein interactions from various literatures based on oursizeable efforts. The HCoV-associated host proteins of several HCoVs, includingSARSCoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, MHV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 were pooled. Theseproteins were either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or were involved in criticalpathways of HCoV infection identified by multiple experimental sources, including highthroughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) systems, viral protein pull-down assay, in vitrocoimmunoprecipitation and RNA knock down experiment. In total, the virus-hostinteraction network included 6 HCoVs with 119 host proteins (Supplementary TableS3).Next, we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and GeneOntology (GO) enrichment analyses to evaluate the biological relevance and functionalpathways of the HCoV-associated proteins. All functional analyses were performedusing Enrichr[                    Here, we collected drug-target interaction information from the DrugBank database(v4.3)[          To build a comprehensive list of human PPIs, we assembled data from a total of 18bioinformatics and systems biology databases with five types of experimentalF.C. conceived the study.

Drug repurposing, represented as aneffective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the timeand reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinicaltrials[8-10]. In addition,targeting single virus proteins often have high risk of drug resistance by the rapidevolution of virus genomes [1]. Viruses (including HCoV) require host cellular factors for successful replicationduring infections[1]. Subsequently, targeting cellular antiviral targets, such as virus-host interactome,may offer a novel strategy for the development of effective treatments for viralinfections[1], including SARS-CoV[16], MERS-CoV[16], Ebola virus[                In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodologythat combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform thatquantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in thehuman PPI network. The basis for these experiments rests on the notions that (i) theproteins that functionally associate with viral infection (including HCoV) are localized inthe corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human PPI network[                  To date, 7 pathogenic HCoVs (Figure 2A and 2B) have been found[                    HCoVs have five major protein regions for virus structure assembly and viralreplications[          Protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-nCoV was mostevolutionarily conserved with SARS-CoV (Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, these hostproteins are either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or are involved in crucialpathways of HCoV infection. For a drug with multiple targets to be effective against an          HCoV, its target proteins should be within or in the immediate vicinity of thecorresponding subnetwork in the human interactome (Figure 1), as we demonstrated inmultiple diseases [          In total, we computationally identified 135 drugs that were associated (Z < -1.5and P < 0.05, permutation test) with the HCoV-host interactome (Figure 4A andSupplementary Table S4).
