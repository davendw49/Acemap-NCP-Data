This notion was quickly picked up by the laypress and sparked concerns among physicians and patients regardingthe intake of inhibitors of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system(RAAS) by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARSCoV2) infected individuals.1 In this article, we try to shed light onwhat is known and unknown regarding the RAAS and SARS-CoV2interaction. We find translational evidence for diverse roles of theRAAS, which allows to formulate also the opposite hypothesis, i.e.that inhibition of the RAAS might be protective in COVID-19.As of March 11, 124 910 patients worldwide have been testedpositive for COVID-19 with a reported death toll amounting to 4589patients, and the numbers continue to rise.2 First analyses of patientcharacteristics from China showed that diabetes, hypertension, andcardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent among SARS-CoV2infected patients, and may be associated with poor outcome.3Specifically, their prevalence was roughly three- to four-foldincreased among patients reaching the combined primary endpointof admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, ordeath compared to patients with less severe outcomes. In general,patients with these conditions are frequently treated with inhibitorsof the RAAS, namely ACE-Is, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers(ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)....

ACE-Is and ARBs increase ACE2 expression andactivity (grey) as shown by a few animal and human studies,6,7 but the mechanism has yet to be identified. Although there is currently no evidence, thiscould theoretically increase viral load and worsen outcome (red). In a reverse causality, ACE2 acts as a gatekeeper of the RAAS by degrading AngII toAng1-7, hence diminishing its Ang II receptor 1-mediated deleterious effects. Therefore, ACE-I or ARB treatment could theoretically mitigate lunginjury (green). Evidence for this mainly stems from animal studies.9,10 Providing soluble recombinant (r)ACE2 (blue) addresses both mechanisms bycell independent binding of SARS-CoV2 and degrading AngII to Ang 1-7. This concept is currently being tested in a pilot study in patients withCOVID-19.13pulmonary disease, a key pathophysiological role was shown forACE, angiotensin II and angiotensin II receptor type 1.9 SARS-CoV orSARS-CoV spike protein led to down-regulation of ACE2 and moresevere lung injury in mice that could be attenuated by administrationof an ARB9,10 These findings suggest a protective role of ARB inSARS-CoV associated lung injury and give rise to the hypothesis thatprimary activation of the RAAS in cardiovascular patients, rather thanits inhibition, renders them more prone to a deleterious outcome.11It is important to note that Guan et al.3 do not report how manypatients were taking ACE-Is or ARBs. Based on data from the ChinaPEACE Million Persons Project, nearly half of Chinese adults between35 and 75 years are suffering from hypertension, but fewer than onethird receive treatment, and blood pressure control is achieved inless than 10%.12 Furthermore, there is thus far no data showing thathypertension or diabetes are independent predictors of fataloutcome. Therefore, based on currently available data and statistics, theassumption of a causal relationship between ACE-I or ARB intakeand deleterious outcome in COVID-19 is not legitimate. In fact, in acase of reverse causality, patients taking ACE-Is or ARBs may bemore susceptible for viral infection and have higher mortality becausethey are older, more frequently hypertensive, diabetic, and/or havingrenal disease.Clearly, much more research is needed to clarify the multifacetedrole of the RAAS in connection with SARS-CoV2 infection.

Withdrawal of RAAS inhibition or preemptive switch toalternate drugs at this point seems not advisable, since it might evenincrease cardiovascular mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.Conflict of interest: O.P. reports personal fees from Novartis,personal fees from Pfizer, grants and personal fees from BoehringerIngelheim, grants and personal fees from AstraZeneca, grants fromSanofi, personal fees from Vifor Pharma, personal fees from MSD,outside the submitted work.
