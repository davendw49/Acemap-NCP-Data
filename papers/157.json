We estimated the age-specific case fatality ratio (CFR) by fitting a transmission model to data from China, accounting for underreporting of cases and the time delay to death. Overall CFR among all infections was 1.6% (1.4-1.8%) and increased considerably for the elderly, highlighting the expected burden for populations with further expansion of the COVID-19 epidemic around the globe.", "text": "A PREPRINT - 3 MARCH 2020Chinese population Confirmed cases Reported deaths        The outbreak of COVID-19 appears to originate from multiple zoonotic transmission events at the HuananWholesale Seafood market in Wuhan in early December 2019, with the animal source remaining unknown [                We simulated the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei from 1 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. Weused an age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartmental model, with a distinctionbetween asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. We stratified the population by 10-year ranges, leading to9 age classes (0-9 years old, ..., 80 years old and more).

It includes four parameters:the initial transmission rate, the decrease in transmission due the control measures, the time delay betweenimplementation and effect and the slope of this decrease. We assumed that symptomatic people had an age-specificcase-fatality rate and that time from onset to death followed a log-normal distribution with mean 20.2 days andstandard deviation 11.6 [                We simultaneously fitted our model to four data sets: (1) the number of confirmed cases by day of disease onsetfrom January 1 to February 11, (2) the number of deaths by day of occurrence from January 1 to February 11, (3)the age distribution of all confirmed cases until 11 February and (4) the age distribution of all deaths reported by 11February. These data were extracted from the CCDC report [        Our model accurately describes the dynamics of transmission and mortality by age group during the COVID-19epidemic in Hubei from 1 January to 11 February (Figure 2). Control measures implemented on 20 January led toa reduction of transmissibility by 99% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 97-100), with a diminution in case incidenceafter six days. Under the assumption that the risk of transmission of COVID-19 was homogeneous by age, so thatthe deficit of reported cases in the younger age classes can be attributed to surveillance bias, the total number ofsymptomatic cases was estimated to 74,200 (95%CrI: 67,000-81,600), 1.8 times more than the 41,092 reportedcases during that period. Under the assumption that 49% of infections lead to symptoms, this implies that a total of152,700 individuals (95%CrI: 137,800-167,900) were infected in the Hubei province during that period.As of 11 February, 979 deaths have been reported among people infected before that date. Under our assumptionregarding the distribution of the delay between disease onset and death, the model predicts a total of 2,441 deaths(95%CrI: 2,225-2702) among all people infected before 11 February. This results in an adjusted CFR of 1.6%(95%CrI: 1.4-1.8) among all people infected by COVID-19 in Hubei during that period. Moreover, our adjustmentleads to sensible modifications of the age-specific CFR (Table 1). Compared to the crude CFR, the adjusted CFR iseven lower in the younger age classes (0-59 years old) but higher in people aged 60 and more.        In this work, we propose a comprehensive solution to the estimation of CFR from surveillance data during outbreaks[                Our work has several limitations. (1) Our results depend on the central assumption that the cause of the deficit ofreported cases among younger age groups is a surveillance bias and does not reflect a lower risk of infection inyounger individuals. The reason for this age shift is unknown [        We developed a mechanistic approach to correct for the biases in the crude estimates of CFR and provide anadjusted CFR by age group with regards to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China between 1 Januaryand 11 February. We find that 1.6% (1.4-1.8) of individuals infected with COVID-19 during that period with orwithout symptoms died or will die, with even more important differences by age group than suggested by the rawdata. The probability of death among infected individuals with symptoms is estimated at 3.3% (2.9-3.8), with asteep increase over 60 years old to reach 36% over 80 years old. While specific to the situation in Hubei, Chinaduring this period, these findings will help the mitigation efforts and planning of resources as other regions preparefor COVID-19 epidemics.JR is funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant 174281).
