The reported serial intervals range from -11 days to20 days, with a mean of 3.96 days (95% confidence interval: 3.53-4.39), a standard deviationof 4.75 days (95% confidence interval: 4.46-5.07), and 12.1% of reports indicatingpre-symptomatic transmission.A new coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and was declared apublic health emergency of international concern \u200bby the World Health Organization (WHO)on \u200bJanuary 30, 2020\u200b \u200b(1)\u200b. As of February 19, 2020, the WHO has reported over 75,204COVID-19 infections and over 2,009 COVID-19 deaths \u200b(2)\u200b, while key aspects of thetransmission dynamics of COVID-19 remain unclear \u200b(3)\u200b. The serial interval of COVID-19 isdefined as the time duration between a primary case (infector) developing symptoms andsecondary case (infectee) developing symptoms \u200b(4,5)\u200b. Obtaining robust estimates for thedistribution of COVID-19 serial intervals is a critical input for determining the reproductionnumber which can indicate the extent of interventions required to control an epidemic \u200b(6)\u200b.However, this quantity cannot be inferred from daily case count data alone \u200b(7)\u200b.To obtain reliable estimates of the serial interval, we obtained data on 468 COVID-19transmission events reported in mainland China outside of Hubei Province between January21, 2020, and February 8, 2020. Each report consists of a probable date of symptom onset forboth the infector and infectee as well as the probable locations of infection for both cases.The data include only confirmed cases that were compiled from online reports from 18provincial centers for disease control and prevention.        Notably, 59 of the 468 reports indicate that the infectee developed symptoms earlier than theinfector. Thus, pre-symptomatic transmission may be occurring, i.e., infected persons may beinfectious before their symptoms appear. In light of these negative-valued serial intervals, weassume that COVID-19 serial intervals follow a normal distribution rather than the morecommonly assumed gamma or Weibull distributions that are limited to strictly positive values(8,9)\u200b. We estimate a mean serial interval for COVID-19 of 3.96 [95% CI 3.53-4.39] with astandard deviation of 4.75 [95% CI 4.46-5.07], which is considerably lower than reportedmean serial intervals of 8.4 days for SARS \u200b(9)\u200b and 12.6 days \u200b(                These estimates reflect reported symptom onset dates for 752 cases from 93 Chinese cities,who range in age from 1 to 90 years (mean 45.2 years and SD 17.21 years). We note threekey caveats of the analysis. First, the data are restricted to online reports of confirmed casesand therefore may be biased towards more severe cases in areas with a high-functioninghealthcare and public health infrastructure. Second, the distribution of serial intervals variesthroughout an epidemic, with the time between successive cases contracting around theepidemic peak \u200b(        Given the heterogeneity in type and reliability of these sources, we caution that our findingsshould be interpreted as working hypotheses regarding the infectiousness of COVID-19requiring further validation as more data become available.

The data were extracted inChinese from the websites of provincial public health departments and translated to English.We then filtered the data for clearly indicated transmission events consisting of: (i) a knowninfector\u200b and \u200binfectee\u200b , (ii) reported locations of infection for both cases, and (iii) reported datesand locations of symptom onset for both cases. We thereby obtained 468 infector-infecteepairs from 93 Chinese cities between January 21, 2020 and February 8, 2020 (Figure S1).The index cases (infectors) for each pair are reported as either importations from the city ofWuhan (\u200bN\u200b = 239), importations from cities other than Wuhan (\u200bN\u200b = 106) or local infections (\u200bN= 122). The cases included 752 unique individuals, with 98 index cases who infected multiplepeople and 17 individuals that appear as both infector and infectee. They range in age from 1to 90 years and include 386 females, 363 males and 3 cases of unreported sex.          For each pair, we calculated the number of days between the reported symptom onset date forthe infector and the reported symptom onset date for the infectee. Negative values indicatethat the infectee developed symptoms before the infectee.
