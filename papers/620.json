There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with nonlinear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities.

If theHuoYan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases couldstarted to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reducedby at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%.

The qRT-PCR based nucleic acid57585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384testing is regarded as one of the gold standards for the detection of coronavirus relateddisease (COVID-19). From January 3rd, the Chinese Center for Disease Control andPrevention (CCDCP) began to distribute nucleic acid testing kits to hospitals andmedical institutions, and carried out testings according to their own capabilities.However, the large-scale and standardization nucleic acid testing has always been aproblem that troubles the entire disease control system, including the CCDCP, hospitalsand clinical laboratories. Quality control of the sampling procedure, equipments, testingkits and processes lack consistency amongst 97 institutions in Hubei Province and morethan 40 institutions in Wuhan, making it hard to centralize and scale-up the testings,deliver the results and admit the infected on a timely manner. The above mentionedtechnical issues of the clinical testing lead to the controversy about the effectiveness ofthe nucleic acid testing by the doctors, experts and officials, which converted into thesocial panic. On February 4th, the fifth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan forthe novel coronavirus disease even adapted the imaging features of pneumonia (byCTscanning) as the diagnosis standard of COVID-19 in Hubei Province published by theNational Health Commission [3].Though the province-scale quarantine is unprecedented, however the number ofsuspected infections kept increasing due to a series issues with regard to the nucleicacid testing, which leading to serious delay of both diagnosis and hospital admission.To cope with that, the Wuhan government made another key strategic decision to buildan emergent clinical virus testing infrastructure on Jan 29th, i.e. the Huo-Yan Laboratory,with a testing capacity over 10,000 per day (Figure 1). Huo-Yan was expanded into asite of 2,000 m2 within a week from an existing laboratory that continuously deliverstesting results. Since Huo-Yan put into use on Feb 5th, its testing capacity kept stablyincreasing due to the automated nucleic acid extraction device and optimization ofprocedure. Then Huo-Yan have achieved 14,000 testing capacity per day on Feb 9thalong with the original site and exceeded 20,000 testing capacity per day on Mar 1st.858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112And finally substantially contributed to achieve the \u201cdaily settlement\u201d (no suspectedcases each day) raised by Hubei Provincial government starting by Feb 16th. On Feb19th, the sixth edition of the diagnosis and treatment plan for the novel coronavirusdisease [3] recalled the practice of using imaging features of pneumonia for the diagnosisof COVID-19 in Hubei Province.Testing is the key to the prevention and control of infectious diseases, for only byidentifying the infected can they be isolated and treated, as well as to stop thetransmission. So far, there was no empirical data and numeric model to clarify theimpact of standardized and large-scale clinical testing platform on the prevention andcontrol of contagion. Here we present a novel differential model with non-lineartransfer coefficients and competitive compartments to evaluate the trends of suspectedcases under different nucleic acid testing capacities.Data SourceThe number of daily received samples and the maximum testing capacity of Huo-YanLaboratory were taken into the model for the estimation of the testing (Figure 1). Thedata of suspected cases, diagnosed cases, hospitalized patients and recovered patientseach day which released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province were used forvalidation of the model.Estimation of the number of nucleic acid testing carried out in Hubei ProvinceAs the response to the rapid increment of suspected cases, the testing capacity of thehospitals, the local disease control and prevention institutions and the clinical testinglaboratories in Hubei Province increased from c.a. 3,000 to over 30,000 tests per day.In the period of simulation (Feb 25th-March 6rd), Huo-Yan had finished over 163,000testings by March 6th, with a team of 130 personals. Besides, the 20 teams of 83113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140personals sent by CCDCP together with local lab professionals and supportingpersonals, had finished 105,641 testings by the end of February. In Wuhan, the 23 mostqualified hospitals could perform over 7,000 tests per day. The specifics of the testingcarried out in Hubei Province were as follows:1) From January 19th, since the testing kits became available to hospitals and medicalinstitutions, the daily testing capacity (TC) of Hubei Province was expected to be TC02) From Jan. 26th to Feb. 11th, the daily testing capacity of clinical testing laboratoriesincreased rapidly. Testing capacity of the Huo-Yan Laboratory, TCHY (t) increased to10,000 per day on Feb 4th, and Huo-Yan accounted for 30%-45% of the testing in Hubei3) From February 11th to March 1st, TCHY (t) increased from 10,000 to 20,000 per day\uff0cdelivered 40%-50% of the testing results in Hubei Province.Estimation of the total infected population of novel coronavirus and other pathogensAccording to the modified SEIR model by Yang et al [1], after taken the whole provincequarantine measures in Hubei, the infected cases decreased from 43,000 on Feb 25th to34,000 on Mar 6th. The suspected patents were usually with characteristics of fever andinfluenza-like illnesses (ILIs), and the existing epidemiological data showed anincremental trend of ILIs patients from 2015 to 2017 in Wuhan, along with annual ILIsprevalence of 4.5% in Wuhan [4]. The ILIs cases in the 1st quarter of each year accountedfor about 20% (varying from 17% to 46%), therefore we estimated the annual totalinfected patients of ILIs other than coronavirus could be over 460,000 in the first quarterof 2020 in Hubei Province, which would lead to over 5,000 patients with similarsymptom of COVID-19 per day.Model for predicting suspected casesA novel model was used to illustrate the influence of testing capacity on the prevention141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162and control of COVID-19 (Figure 3). Unlike the common dynamic model used onlylinear differential equations, this model applied the increasement of testing capacityinto account. Since the quarantine measures in Hubei, the contact probability amongpeople was reduced, which significantly reduced the possibility of large-scaletransmission. Meanwhile, due to quarantine, people were more alert to fever and othersymptoms, leading to more patients surged into the hospital and a continuousincreasement suspected cases. The purpose of nucleic acid testing was to 1) identifypatients with COVID-19 from the uninfected, and allow them to be hospitalized; 2)after the symptoms disappear, the inpatient with more than twice negative testing results(the interval must be more than 24 hours) could be discharged [3].The conversion efficiency from suspected to hospital admission depended on the testingcapacity (TC(t)), the number of existing and newly discovered the suspected cases,however there was a bottleneck of nucleic acid testing. As soon as the daily testingcapacity was greater than the existing suspected plus the newly suspected of the day,the \u201cdaily settlement\u201d of suspected cases could be achieved.The differential equation derived from the following models:( ) = 0( ) =( ) +  ( ) = (1 \u2212  ) \u00b7( )( ) =( ) +  ( ) =  ( )\u2219  \u2219  d  ( )dt  \u210e ( )dt=  \u2219  ( ) \u2212( ) \u00b7 NTD(t)=   \u210e\u2219   \u210e ( ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 ( )) \u00b7 ( ) \u210e \u00b7 ( ) <(t)163164165166167168169170171172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189d(t)dtdtd()d()dt= \u03b3 \u2219 ()= \u03b1 \u2219  (t)= ( ) \u00b7 NTD(t) \u2212  \u2219( ) \u2212 \u03b1 \u2219 ()The parameters in the model were as follows:TC(t): the testing capacity.TR(t): the testing requirement from existing and newly discovered suspected patients.PR(t): the positive ratio of the tests for diagnosis (NTR(t)).Etotal (t): the number of COVID-19 latent patients and other diseases in the province.Ecov (t): the latent patients of COVID-19 in the province, including the asymptomaticpopulation.Eother (t): the latent patients that were not infected by the novel coronavirus.\u03c3cov: incubation rate.

The effect of increasedtesting capacity was significant, which was largely up to the government\u2019s decision andthe expansion of the hospitals and clinical testing laboratories (Figure 4).Due to the insufficient testing capacity at the beginning of the province-scale quarantine,the number of suspected cases rose to over 23,000, which became a \u201cdammed lake\u201d fordelayed diagnosis and led to social panic.If the testing capacity did not rapidly increased, the suspected cases could have reacheda maximum of 33,700, resulting in a doubled isolation cost in term of room-days andten thousands medical personals in addition to the over 40,000 medical workers anddoctors which had been sent to Hubei Province. The diagnosis for over 30,000suspected cases would be delayed, half of which are positive results and could causefurther transmission. The turning point of the increment of suspected cases would bedelayed for 6 days and the achievement of \u201cdaily settlement\u201d would be realized at least11 days later.If the established testing capacity was fully used, over 22,800 suspected cases could bediagnosed on time rather than being delayed, and accordingly, the isolation cost couldbe reduced by at least 72%, the turning point of the increment of suspected cases couldarrive one week earlier, and \u201cdaily settlement\u201d could be realized 12 days in advance.Under the ideal scenario, if Hubei Province was capable of carrying out more than10,500 tests per day at the very beginning of the epidemic, there would be no \u201csuspectedcases\u201d in the daily official COVID-19 epidemic report, but only the number ofdiagnosed cases, i.e., either positive or negative, because all of the suspected cases218219220221222223224225226227228229230231232233234235236237238239240241242243244245would be \u201csettled\u201d daily.Novel coronavirus related diseases have been officially defined as pandemic on March11th 2020 by WHO. The quarantine of an entire district, city or a region could beadopted as part of the measures by the government. In Italy, for example, more than 15million people were placed in the country-based quarantine on March 8th [5]. Timely andaccurate clinical test is essential for identifying the infected, cutting off the transmission,and protecting the susceptible. The large-scale, precise, and reliable testing capacity ishighly required to reduce the panic accompanied by the drastic quarantine measures.To increase the testing capacity is a systematic project, among which the qualifiedlaboratory spaces, the standardize of training medical panels, the supplement of theequipment, reagents, consumables and protective materials, and the automation of thetesting procedure were of most importance. Here are the suggestions deduced from thesimulation:1) The large-scale standardize testing platform and QC protocols were the premise ofin the quarantine, which were the prerequisite for the diagnosis of suspected cases,isolate infectious patients, release isolation of convalescent and uninfected healthypopulation, and also the screening of key communities and groups. The practicefrom the centered platform could be summarized and replicated to other laboratories.The quality of the diagnostic kits and the accuracy, timeliness, safeties of thelaboratories must be constantly compared and inspected. Unstandardized testingprocess would cause inconsistency in testing results and led to distrust on the testingresults.2) Encourage the laboratories to increase testing capacities and keep continuesdelivery results at the same time. During emergencies, any changes in the testing246247248249250251252253254255256257258259260261262263264265266267268269270271272273process could cause samples accumulation, and the best solution could be continuesapplying new knowledge, know-hows in small scale and quickly replicate to thewhole testing assembly line. This principle works in deploying new laboratoryspaces, automation equipment, SOP and etc.3) Keep the outsourcing clinical testing laboratory the same priority and responsibilityas the in-house laboratories. Despite of the high efficiency of the outsourcinglaboratory, some hospitals are not willing to perform the outsourcing diagnostictests just because they regard the risk of inaccurate testing results of the outsourcinglaboratories \u201cincontrollable\u201d.4) Central planning of the diagnostic testing and comprehensive tracking of thepotential testing capability to achieve \u201cdaily settlement\u201d. Once there are standardizetesting capacity, arrange the samples to fill the excess capacity immediately.5) Sufficiently supplement the sampling kits and the corresponding trainings to themedical panels. Other issues that require training on the sampling process includingthe barcoding and information input of the samples, and the inactivation of thepathogen before testing.6) Large-scale and standardized clinical laboratory should be regarded asinfrastructure for both common time and emergencies against contagion, and shouldbe put into use as early as possible in any epidemic. A good estimation of the testingcapacity for nucleic acid testing of COVID-19 could be over 10,500 samples perday for a region of 60 million population with over 43,000 infected patients.With Huo-Yan Laboratory as a model, combining with high-throughput sequencing,nucleic acid detection, immunoprotein analysis and other large-scale standardized andautomated analysis methods, we can build infrastructure in the field of public healthagainst the pandemic, so that large and small cities could have their own detectioncapabilities of 100 to 1,000 or 10,000 people when facing various epidemics, we cantake it easy to ensure our life safety, biological safety and economic safety.Huo-Yan is an ad-hoc COVID-19 clinical testing infrastructure owned by the WuhanEast Lake High-tech Development Zone.
