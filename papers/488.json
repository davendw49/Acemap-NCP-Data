{"date": "2020/02/008", "journal": "The Lancet", "authors": "Fu-Sheng Wang", "title": "What to do next to control the 2019-nCoV epidemic?", "type": "Comment", "abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection can lead to acute resolved or fatal pneumonia. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, the main route of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is probably through respiratory droplets. As of Feb 4, 2020, statistical data show that the outbreak constitutes an epidemic threat in China, where the exponential increase in patients has reached 20 438 conrfimed cases, with 2788 (13\u00b764%) patients in critical condition and 425 (2\u00b708%) deaths; 23 214 additional suspected cases have also been identiefid so far. The most aefcted city, Wuhan, and related regions in Hubei province of China have reported 13 522 conrfimed patients (66\u00b716% of total cases) and 414 deaths from 2019 nCoV infection (97\u00b741% of total deaths in China). 632 patients with conrfimed infection have recovered and have been discharged from hospital. However, the downward turning point for new cases of infection has not been observed yet (gfiure). Notably, 159 conrfimed cases have been reported in 23 other countries beyond China, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Australia, the USA, Malaysia, and Germany. Because of the seriousness of this outbreak, WHO declared it a public health emergency of international concern on Jan 30, 2020, followed by the USA announcing a public health emergency on Jan 31, 2020. During the epidemic, rapid and robust research is important to help guide clinical practices and public health policies. Zhu and colleagues sampled bronchoalveolar-lavage uflid from three patients and used next-generation sequencing and PCR to characterise the virus, and they identiefid the pathogen of this outbreak as a novel coronavirus that falls within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus and conrfimed the cytopathic eefcts (structural changes in host cells) of this virus.1 Their achievement not only improves methods of diagnosis conrfimation in clinics but also promotes the study of the underlying mechanisms of viral infection.2 Subsequently, collaborations between Chinese and international scientists have rapidly unmasked some additional virological features of 2019-nCoV. A specicfi viral nucleic acid assay using RT-PCR was quickly developed for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection.3,4 Additionally, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has been shown to be the putative receptor for the entry", "text": "into host cells by use of bioinformatic prediction methods Published Onlineand in-vitro testing.2,5,6 Furthermore, bats are speculated Fhettbprus:a//rdyo4i,.o2r0g2/100.1016/to be the original host of this zoonotic virus, but whether S0140-6736(20)30300-7an intermediate host facilitated the viral infection in See Articles Lancet 2020;published online Jan 29.humans is still unknown.7 Lastly, evidence of person-to- https://doi.org/10.1016/person transmission is accumulating,8,9 with an estimated S0140-6736(20)30211-7 andhttps://doi.org/10.1016/R0 of 2\u00b72 (95% CI 1\u00b74\u20133\u00b79),10 and the assessment of the full S0140-6736(20)30251-8extent of this mode of transmission is urgently needed. For the up-to-date data fromIn The Lancet, two retrospective studies from tahnedCPhrienveesnetCioenntoenr 2fo0r1C9o-nntCrooVlWuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital have recently provided see http://2019ncov.chinacdc.the rfist-hand evidence of epidemiological, clinical, cn/2019-nCoV/ (in Chinese)laboratory, radiological imaging, and outcomesamong 41 patients11 and 99 patients.12 Of 99 patientswith 2019-nCoV pneumonia,12 the average age was55\u00b75 years (SD 13\u00b71) and 50 (51%) patients had chronicdiseases. Clinical manifestations were fever (82 [83%]patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath(31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients),confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%]patients), sore throat (vfie [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea(four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients),2500020000sesca15000litevum10000auCdiarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting(one [1%] patient). In view of the nfidings from bothstudies, as well as accumulated clinical experience,the next crucial step would be to identify the propertreatment for patients infected with 2019-nCoV.No fully proven and specicfi antiviral treatment forthe coronavirus exists. Guidance from China\u2019s NationalHealth Commission suggests taking an anti-HIV drugcombination of lopinavir and ritonavir and inhaling adose of nebulised interferon \u03b1 for the antiviral therapy.13Many eofrts, including several clinical trials, such asNCT04246242 and NCT04252664, are in progress toscreen existing antiviral drugs to identify those that couldbe specicfi and ecfiient against 2019-nCoV. Notably, therifst reported use of remdesivir, in the rfist diagnosedpatient with 2019-nCoV infection in the USA,14 hasencouraged additional clinical study of this medication.More importantly, patients in critical conditions oftendevelop serious complications, such as acute respiratorydistress syndrome (17 [17%] of 99 patients),12 and thusmedical groups should include physicians with expertise inboth infectious diseases and critical care. It is noteworthythat patients in critical condition often show a reductionin peripheral blood lymphocytes.11,12 Whether immunecells inlfitrate into the lungs and then cause seriouslung lesions (as occurred in patients with severe acuterespiratory syndrome [SARS])15 is not clear. Therefore, itis important to understand the lung microenvironmentand the map of immune responses against 2019-nCoVinfection, which might help to denfie clinical stagesand uncover the pathogenesis of the disease. Recentdata showed that most deaths were due to respiratoryfailure;11,12 however, no reports of lung pathology inpatients who died from 2019-nCoV infection have beenreported so far. Notably, elderly men with 2019-nCoVinfection and other underlying diseases often have ahigher fatality rate than that of elderly women or youngerand more healthy patients;11,12 more studies are needed todetermine the associated inuflencing factors underlyingthis nfiding.The development of more ecfiient and quicker methodsfor the detection of viral nucleic acids is needed to ensurethe accuracy of diagnosis. Several challenges remainfor basic research, including viral mutation rate andtransmission, infectivity dynamics, and viralinfectionassociated pathogenicity in vivo. Some evidence hassuggested that the virus can spread during the incubationperiod9,16 and is detectable during the convalescentperiod.16 Notably, the virus was found in the loose stool ofa patient in the USA,14 suggesting potential transmissionthrough the faecal\u2013oral route. It is of high priority toascertain whether persistent asymptomatic carriers of2019-nCoV exist and to reach an accurate denfiition ofwhen a patient can be considered cured. Moreover, nocertainty exists about the source of the outbreak, and aprophylactic vaccine is still under development.WHO has acknowledged the eofrts made by theChinese Government to investigate and contain theoutbreak.17 For example, authorities rapidly initiatedthe rfist measures to isolate Wuhan, which were thenextended to the whole Hubei province, stranding35 million residents during the heavy-travel ChineseSpring Festival holidays. At the same time, the twonewbuilt hospitals in Wuhan have been put into use, with2600 beds for the conrfimed and suspected patientswith pneumonia. The decision makers also extendedthe holiday period and postponed school openings.Additionally, at least 68 medical teams, including morethan 8000 physicians and nurses, from other provincesand cities went to the most aefcted Hubei provinceto gfiht against the disease side by side with the localmedical sta.f 18 The Chinese Government has initiated atleast 13 research programmes as an emergency measureto study the diefrent aspects of the outbreak such as thediagnosis, treatment, and prevention of2019-nCoVassociated disease.19 Novel therapeutic approaches,including treatment with allogeneic mesenchymal stemcells, are expected to progress to clinical trials involvingpatients with 2019-nCoV infection in a critical conditionwhen the projects meet both ethical requirements andthe principle of informed consent (eg, NCT04252118).Furthermore, therapeutic drugs, protective equipment,and charitable funds from inside and outside of China aretransported to the epidemic area to support the response.All these measures are aimed to maximise prevention andminimise the occurrence of new infections, which willhelp the in-time diagnosis and treatment of patients andprotect the healthy population against viral infection notonly in China but also in the rest of the world. China alsofaces other challenges, including asymptomatic carrierswith 2019-nCoV might be a new potential source ofinfection; there will be a huge increase in people returningfrom trips after the Chinese Spring Festival vacation; andit may be dicfiult to control the outbreak due to the lackof adequate medical resources in epidemic communitiesand rural areas of Hubei province.First-line medical staf and scientists in China have hada leading role in gfihting the outbreak of2019-nCoVassociated pneumonia. The basic and essential strategiesthat we should stick to remain the early detection,early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatmentof the disease. With the huge eofrts frommedicalprofessionals to treat patients, substantial public healthprevention measures, and accelerated research, we hopethe downward turning points for both new cases of2019-nCoV and the resulting fatal events might comesoon.We declare no competing interests.*Fu-Sheng Wang, Chao ZhangTreatment and Research Center for Infectious Diseases, The Fifth Medical Centerof PLA General Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for InfectiousDiseases, Beijing 100039, China12345Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.
