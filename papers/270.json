In particular, the cumulativenumber of deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020, a figure that will soon surpass the number ofpeople that succumbed to Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 (1).        In the context of an emerging infectious disease with pandemic potential, it is critical toassess not only its ability to spread between humans, but also the associated risk of death from3334353637383940414243444546474849505152the disease. In particular, the type and intensity of public health interventions are often a functionof these epidemiological metrics. Importantly, in the absence of vaccines or antiviral forSARSCoV and 2019-nCov, the effective implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (socialdistancing) and movement restrictions, which are the only alternative strategies available tomitigate their spread in the population, also pose significant pressure on the global economy (        As interventions are gradually implemented and calibrated during the course of anoutbreak, early estimates of the case fatality risk (CFR) provide crucial information for policymakers. Yet, the estimation of epidemiological characteristics including the CFR during thecourse of an outbreak tend to be affected by right censoring and ascertainment bias (3-5). Thephenomenon of right censoring is caused by the gap of illness onset to death between vulnerablepopulation and healthy population, resulting in underestimation, while ascertainment bias is dueto the unreported bulk of cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic infection, potentiallyleading to overestimation.The purpose of this study is to derive estimates of the time-delay adjusted CFR for2019nCov for Wuhan, China as well as for China excluding the city of Wuhan with quantifieduncertainty in order to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China.We use two different types of data. First, daily confirmed cases and deaths in China wereextracted from daily reports published by China government, Hubei Province in China and5455565758596061626364656667686970        Wuhan City (                Second, fifty epidemiological descriptions of the patients who died of 2019-nCovinfection were obtained from several sources (        Crude CFR is defined as the number of cumulative cases divided by the number of cumulativedeaths at a specific point in time. For the estimation of CFR in real time, we employ the delayfrom hospitalization to death, hs, which is assumed to be given by hs = H(s) \u2013 H(s-1) for s>0where H(s) follows a gamma distribution with mean 10.1 days and SD 5.4 days, obtained fromthe available observed data. Let \u03c0 be the time-delay adjusted case fatality ratio, the likelihoodfunction of the estimate \u03c0 is,; , ,,,,,,,,,,72737475767778798081828384858687where ca,t represents the number of new cases with reported day t in area a, and Da,t is thenumber of new deaths with reported day ti in area a (10-11). We assume that the observedcumulative death, Dt is the result of the binomial sampling process with probability \u03c0.        We estimated model parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method ina Bayesian framework. Posterior distributions of the model parameters were estimated bysampling from the three Markov chains. For each chain, we drew 100,000 samples from theposterior distribution after a burn-in of 20,000 iterations. Convergence of MCMC chains wereevaluated using the potential scale reduction statistic (        All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for StatisticalComputing, Vienna, Austria) using the \u2018rstan\u2019 package.As of February 5th, 2020, a total of 28001 cases and 563 deaths of 2019-nCov have beenreported in China. Of the 28001 cases reported in China, 11618 cases (37.3%) are from WuhanCity, 10494 cases (33.7%) are from Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City and 8976 cases8990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110(28.9%) are from China excluding Hubei Province. Of the 642 deaths in China, 478 deaths(74.5%) are from Wuhan city, 140 deaths (21.9%) are from Hubei Province and only 24 deaths(4%) are from China excluding Hubei Province.excluding Wuhan City and (C) China excluding Hubei Province, and the cumulative deaths in(D) Wuhan City, (E) Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City and (F) Mainland China excludingHubei Province, respectively. The curve of the cumulative number of deaths grows after that ofthe cumulative number of cases, and the increase in the number of deaths in Wuhan City isoccurring more rapidly and the associated mortality burden appears to be much higher relative torest of China, while the cumulative case counts for the three areas in China are similar.Hubei Province, and model-based posterior estimates of time-delay adjusted CFR in (D) WuhanCity, (E) Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City and (F) Mainland China excluding HubeiProvince, January \u2013 February in 2020, respectively. Our model-based crude CFR fitted theobserved data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage. Duringthe course of the outbreak, our model-based posterior estimates of time-delay adjusted CFR takemuch higher values than the observed crude CFR, excluding at the early stage in Wuhan Cityand the later stage in China excluding Hubei Province. Our estimates of the time-delay adjustedCFR appear to be decreasing almost consistently in Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City andin China excluding Hubei Province, whereas in Wuhan city, estimates were low at the early stageand then increased and peaked in the midst of the study period, and are now following adecreasing trend similar to the other two areas, reaching estimates around 20%.112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132The latest estimates of the time-delay adjusted CFR are at 18.9% (95%CrI: 17,1-20.8%)in Wuhan City, 6.1% (95%CrI: 5.2-7.1%) in Hubei Province excluding Wuhan City and 0.9%(95%CrI: 0.6-1.3%) in China excluding Hubei Province, while the observed crude CFR takesProvince excluding Wuhan City and 0.27 % (95%CI: 0.2-0.4%) in China excluding HubeiProvince, respectively. (Figure 3, Table)In this paper we have derived estimates of the CFR for the ongoing 2019-nCov outbreakin China. We have estimated time-delay adjusted CFR in three different areas in China and foundthat the most severely affected areas are Wuhan City as well as the Hubei Province excludingWuhan City while the rest of China exhibits a milder impact (China excluding Hubei Province).We found that the latest estimates of the delay adjusted CFR in Wuhan City is as high as18.9% (95%CrI: 17.1-20.8%), an estimate that his 3-fold higher than our estimate for HubeiProvince excluding Wuhan City and around 20-fold higher than our estimate for China excludingHubei Province. These findings suggest that the ongoing situation in Wuhan is particularly direcompared to the other affected areas. Upward trend of CFR at the early phase generally indicatesa deterioration of an ascertainment bias.        However, this upward trend should be interpreted with caution. In particular, thedifficulties in diagnosis cases of 2019-Cov because the associated symptoms are not specific.Further, the fraction of 2019-Cov patients who develop mild symptoms including asymptomaticpatients is not minor, which complicates detection and diagnosis early after symptoms onset,134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155leading to ascertainment bias (        A downward trend in CFR is suggestive of the extent of improvements inepidemiological surveillance. In addition, this pattern indirectly supports a significant number ofmild or asymptomatic cases in Wuhan City, and the underlying transmission might prolong theend of the outbreak or further transmission to other areas unless effective social distancingmeasures are implemented while a vaccine becomes available. Furthermore, given that both thedelay adjusted CFR and crude CFR estimates in Wuhan City are around 20-fold higher than ourestimates for China excluding Hubei Province suggests a breakdown in medical care deliveryand points to the critical need for urgent medical support in the epicenter of the epidemic.157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174175176177We also found that the estimates of delay adjusted CFR both in in Hubei Provinceexcluding Wuhan City and in China excluding Hubei Province show a time-dependent decliningtrend as the epidemic progresses. Indeed, a similar trend has been previously reported for theMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea in 2015, where asignificant fraction of the cases had comorbidities or were senior patients (16-17). If theproportion of vulnerable cases is high at the early phase and gets proportionally smaller in thelater stage of the outbreak, this partly explains the time dependent decline. However, since theepidemic has yet to peak, this time dependent decrease is likely caused by ascertainment bias.Moreover, both of the latest estimates of the delay adjusted CFR and crude CFR in HubeiProvince are around 6-7 fold higher than that in China excluding Hubei Province, where thehealth care system has not reached peak capacity. This also indicates the need to anticipate foradditional medical support to deliver medical care to the most vulnerable and at highest risk ofsuccumbing to the disease from underlying medical conditions.Our study is not free from limitations. First, our CFR estimate is influenced byascertainment bias and this might influence estimates upwards. For those infectious diseasescharacterized by a large fraction cases with mild or asymptomatic illness, the infection fatalityrisk, e.g., the number of death divided by the total infected, is a more appropriate index ofdisease burden (22-23). For this purpose, mass serological surveillance and surveys to assess thepresence/absence of symptoms is strongly recommended to disentangle the threat of emerginginfectious diseases including 2019-nCov.Second, in our estimation we employed the time delay distribution from illness onset todeaths (N=39), which was obtained from secondary sources, but the available data does not179180181182183184185186187188189190include either the date of illness onset or the confirmed date. For this reason, we utilized the timedelay from hospitalization to death (N=33).In conclusion, our latest estimates of the risk of 2019-Cov deaths in China could be ashigh as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas this estimate is around 1% in the relativelymildly-affected areas in China as of February 5th, 2020. Because it is likely that the death riskfrom 2019-nCov is associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system in the absence ofpharmaceutical interventions (vaccination and antiviral drugs), enhanced public healthinterventions including social distancing, quarantine, enhanced infection control in healthcaresettings and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to rapidly contain thisepidemic.KM acknowledges support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)KAKENHI Grant Number 15K20936, from Program for Advancing Strategic InternationalNetworks to Accelerate the Circulation of Talented Researchers Grant Number G2801 and fromthe Leading Initiative for Excellent Young Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture,Sport, Science & Technology of Japan.GC acknowledges support from NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDAEcology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program; UK Biotechnology and BiologicalSciences Research Council grant BB/M008894/1.1.
