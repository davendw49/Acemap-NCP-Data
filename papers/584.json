The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted. With this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing Italian epidemic was compensated by the Chinese experience, allowing to obtain a SIRD model for this relatively new COVID-19 outbreak. According to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28th of March, with almost 42,000 infected people.", "text": "The COVID-19 disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),has spread rapidly in the first months of the 2020 and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the11th of March declared a global pandemic [1]. COVID-19 symptoms are often (80%) mild [2], mayappear 2-14 days after exposure (mean incubation period 5-6 days) [2], and include fever, cough andshortness of breath [3]. However the 13.8% of infected have severe disease and the 6.1% are critical(respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [2]. Mild cases typicallyrecover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks torecover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two toeight weeks [2]. In the severe and critical disease, the patient admission to intensive care unit (ICU) isnecessary and the mechanical ventilation (artificial assistance to support breathing), may be required[4]. This special treatment is the bottle neck of most of the health care systems, which are not preparedto deal with the numbers of patients that the COVID-19 disease could produce. Therefore, measures ofcontainment of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are essential to not overstress the health care systems andto manage the pandemic.The SARS-CoV-2 was firstly reported at the end of 2019 in the Wuhan city (Hubei province), China,reaching epidemic proportion at the end of January 2020. On the 23rd of January the Chinese governmentimposed the lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province in an effort to quarantine the centerof a COVID-19 outbreak. These drastic measures, with almost 60 million of people in quarantine, weredefined \u201cunprecedented in public health history\u201d by the WHO. Unfortunately, these measures were notable to stop the spreading of SARS-CoV-2, which caused several outbreaks around the globe.Italy was one of the countries most affected by the SARS-CoV-2, reporting the first positive patient onthe 20th of February 2020, followed by an extensive (and unexpected) epidemic in the north of Italy,especially in the Lombardy region. The Italian government, similarly to the Chinese government,progressively from the 8th of March to the 11th of March 2020 imposed the lockdown in the whole nation,introducing the so called \u201csocial distancing\u201d.These drastic measures, also adopted by other EU countries, apart from the health sector, have a dramaticimpact on the global economy as well as on the lifestyle habits of millions of people. Epidemiologicdescriptions and predictions could help in the understanding of the dynamic of the COVID-19 disease,supporting governments and health authorities in the resources allocation [5]. Most of the modelsproposed until now to describe the COVID-19 outbreaks, due to the scarcely data available of a stillongoing epidemic, are heuristic models. These models are \u201cfitting\u201d equation, exponential [5] or logistic[6], used to describe the infection data, whose parameters have scarce (or none) physical meaning andtheir use for prediction, especially at long term, should be avoided. On the contrary compartmentalmodels could constitute the right trad-off between the need of having physical based parameters, theeasiness of solution and the scarce presence of data in the evolving epidemic. Typically, the populationof interest is subdivided into a small number of compartments based on infection status (e.g. susceptible,infectious or recovered) and the flows between these compartments are described by ordinarydifferential equations [7]. Aim of this work is to develop a compartmental model (SIRD) to describefirst the Chinese COVID-19 epidemic and then, by perturbation of the model parameters, to describeand predict the Italian COVID-19 epidemic.In compartmental models the population under study is divided into compartments and, with assumption thatevery individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics, the movements of people within thecompartments can be described. In particular with \u201cSIRD\u201d model a four compartments model is indicated,where \u201cS\u201d indicates the \u201cSusceptible\u201d compartment, \u201cI\u201d specifies the \u201cInfected\u201d compartment, \u201cR\u201d denotesthe \u201cRecovered\u201d compartment and \u201cD\u201d identifies the \u201cDeath\u201d compartment, as schematized in Figure 1.It is assumed that the total population of reference is constant ( = 60 ), meaning that in theconsidered time period the rate of birth and death (including the one related to the COVID-19) are equal [8].This is particularly true for low lethality diseases with very large outbreaks (like a whole nation). It is alsoassumed that recovered people cannot be re-infected [9]. The ordinary differential equations, with their initialconditions, describing the movements of people from one compartment to the other are reported in the eq.(14).= \u2212  S(t = 0) = S! =  \u2212 ! \u2212 ! \u2212 !  =   \u2212  \u2212 ( = 0) = ! = \"#$#(1)( = 0) = ! = \"#$#(1) =  = (1)(2)(3)(4)( = 0) = ! = \"#$#(1)In eq. 1,  represents the number of people susceptible to the disease (total minus the already interested ones), is the average number of contacts per person per time [1/day] (multiplied by the probability of diseasetransmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject). The probability to get infected isproportional to the product of the infected and the susceptible individuals, or better to the fraction of infectedindividuals (/) and the susceptible.In eq. 2,  represents the number of infected people, whose initial value is taken from the literature data.Susceptible people get infected by the contact with other infected people (first term RHS), whereas infectedpeople can recover ( ) with the kinetic , which is inversely proportional to the duration of the infection anddirectly proportional to the probability of recovery. Moreover, critical patients can die () with the kinetic ,which is inversely proportional to the average time between the infection and the death and directlyproportional to the lethality of the disease.Eq. 3 and eq. 4 describe the time evolution of the number of recovered patients  and the death patients .Actually, the four equations are not independent and the fourth one can be derived from the total balance onthe population:() =  \u2212 () \u2212 () \u2212 () (5)Despite very simple SIR (o SIRD) models are based on constant kinetics (, , ) to describe the epidemicevolution until the depletion of the susceptible people, the measures taken by the governments have had hugeimpact on the epidemic and therefore on its evolution kinetics.The kinetic  is most of the time used as fitting parameter to describe the epidemiologic data. In this case, withthe \u201cquarantine\u201d protocol taken by the governments, the number of contacts per person per unit time candramatically decrease during the epidemic. In this work the kinetic of infection was described with anexponential function:(6)(7)(8)() = ! exp 7\u22128 + \"! (actually ! + \") is the initial (high) infection kinetics that decreases exponentially thanks to the lockdownmeasures. \" is the infection kinetic at infinite time, which can be set to be zero due to a long enough periodof people isolation. # is the characteristic time of decrease, at  = 3 # the kinetic of infection would bedecreased of the 90%.The kinetic of recovery , in case of a new disease like the COVID-19, is not a constant. The health caresystem, the medical doctors with all their staff have to learn new therapeutic procedures, get used to treatpatients with new symptoms etc. This means that initially the time of recovery will be longer, therefore thekinetic of recovery slower, until a new constant value is reached that should be inversely proportional to theaverage duration of the infection. In this work  was modeled with a logistic function: () =  ! +\"1 + exp=\u2212 + > () = ! exp ?\u2212%Where  ! is the recovery kinetic at time zero,  ! +  \" is the recovery kinetic at regime, which is reachedafter $ days of adaptation.The kinetic of death , especially for new diseases, it is not constant and decreases with time, luckily. This isdue to both the adaptation of the pathogen, whose less lethal strains tend to be the most spread, as well as dueto the development of new clinical treatments. In this work an exponential decay function was used to describethis evolution:Where (!+\") is the initial death rate, which decreases substantially (90%) at  = 3 %, and reaches alongterm lethality rate \".The model was implemented and solved in MATLAB 2019b, with the ode45 solver, based on an explicitRunge-Kutta (4,5) formula. The optimization of the model parameters to describe the experimental results wasperformed via the minimization of the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) between the modeling and epidemiologicdata. The SSE function was minimized with application of gradient-based method (fmincon) first, followed bya step of minimization with a gradient-free algorithm (pattern-search), followed by a third step ofgradientbased method. The use of these three steps was necessary to reach the local minimum, whereas the reachingof a global minimum was proved with the multi-starting technique.The epidemiologic data were taken from an open source repository operated by the Johns Hopkins UniversityCenter for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) [10]. The data regard the total number of cases, therecovered cases and the death cases. The number of infected can be estimated by the difference of the totalnumber of cases minus the recovered and the death cases. As it can be seen the Chinese outbreak has beenalmost suppressed, with the peak of infection around the 18th of February. The Italian outbreak is instead stillin the fast-growing phase but with the number of deaths already close to the Chinese one.A)D)B)C)The Chinese outbreak of COVID-19, almost at the end of its development, can be used to understand thedynamic of COVID-19 disease. The model parameters obtained for the description of the Chinese outbreakwere perturbated to describe the initial Italian outbreak and to predict its evolution.The SIRD model results for the Chinese COVID-19 outbreak are reported in Figure 3. The model parameters(8 parameters) were fitted on the experimental data, obtaining a satisfactorily description of the epidemiologicdata published so far.The modeling infection peak is around the 18th of February, with almost 50,000 people infected, in accordancewith the data, predicting the end of the outbreak at the beginning of May.It is interesting to analyzed the value of the obtained modeling parameters, reported in Table 1, to make somephysical considerations. The average number of contacts per person per time decreased with a characteristictime #=10.46 [day]. It is worth to note that the epidemiologic data are referred to the lockdown day -1. Sincethan the average number of contacts per person decreased exponentially, due to the quarantine, and diminishedof 90% after almost 30 days (3#). This demonstrate, along with the experimental date itself, that it required30 days after the lockdown to substantially slow down the spreading of the virus.The parameters referred to the kinetic of recovery  !,  \", $ can give information on time of recovery(&'()*'&+). Actually  \u221d &'()*'&+/&'()*'&+, therefore considering the probability of recovery (&'()*'&+)of 90% (R/(R+I+D)), the recovery time at regime (after 30 days ($)) was &'()*'&+ = 13 days.The parameters related to the kinetic of death, analogously can be used to obtain information about the averagetime between the symptoms and the death. Considering the death probability of 4.5% (D/(R+I+D)), the averagedeath time was progressively increased from 5 days in the first week (22-28th January) to 9 days consideringthe first 3 week, until reaching two months (meaning a lethality close to zero) at the end of the epidemic. Thisunexpected result can be explained considering that the treatments were improved as well as considering aparameter not directly accounted in this model: the relation between lethality and patience age [11]. Indeed the\u201cquarantine\u201d measures may be particular effective for old people (>60 years) and for people with morecomorbidities, who form the group of patients in which the COVID-19 lethality is the highest.The Italian modeling of the outbreak was performed by perturbation of the Chinese parameters (starting pointsof the optimization) and adding some constraints on the range of variability of the parameters. The modelingstarts from the 26/02/2020, day in which the total cases in Italy were close to the cases in Hubei on the22/01/2020 (around 400). The population of the Hubei province and Italy is also roughly the same: 60 million.The main Italian lockdown was performed on the 11th of March, when the cases were already 10590 (againstthe 438 on the 23rd of January in China). To account for this delay, the equations for the description of theItalian outbreak were slightly adjusted for () and ().() = H0 exp 7\u2212! ,  < ( \u2212 )80 ,  < +,-./,0 1() = /2 exp 0\u2212 ( \u2212 +,-3./,0 1)1 + 4(9)(10)Considering a constant rate for the number of contacts per person and also a constant kinetic of death beforethe date of lockdown (between the 26th of February and the 11th of March). After the lockdown both thefunction decrease exponentially due to the isolation of people (reduction of ) and especially for categoriesthat are at greatest risk of death (reduction of ). From the Chinese model, the characteristic time of infection#, the characteristic time of death % as well as the lethality rate at long time \" were imported and not usedas optimizable parameters, considering comparable the measures taken by the Chinese and the Italiangovernment and therefore their impact on the outbreaks.The modeling results obtained are reported in Figure 4. The epidemiologic data are well described with theoptimization of the five adjustable parameters. According to the model prediction the peak is expected betweenthe end of March and the beginning of April (28th of March precisely) with almost 42,000 infected people.According to the data reported in [2], if the 6% of patients will require an admission to the intensive care unit,the number of beds in those units should be around 2500 (in accordance with [5]) which is almost half of thetotal availability [5].It is interesting to note that despite the same characteristic time of infection and the delay in the governmentrestrictive measures, the peak is expected before April 11th (one month after the lockdown). This is because,as it can be seen from the Chinese and Italian infection kinetics, the \u201cforce of infection\u201d is lower in Italy, whichcould be explained considering that the mains outbreaks in Italy have been developed in small cities, whereasin the Hubei province the principal outbreak was in the metropolitan city of Wuhan (11 million of people). Ithas also to be said that the peak is anticipated because of a greater lethality, that removes at higher rate (almostthe double with the respect to the Chinese outbreak) patients from the infected compartment. Higher lethality,which is estimated by the model to be around the 11%, reflects also on the total number of death people at theend of the outbreak that, sadly, should be close to 10,000. The D-curve in Figure 4 is of course a sigma-shapedone, and it can be of interest to fit the experimental data by a proper equation, in order to provide easy estimateof proximal behavior. It is disputed if the D-curve has to obey the Logistic behavior (Logistic is the analyticsolution for constant-parameter SIS model), or something different (e.g. Gompertz curve). The fit of the modelcalculation given in Figure 4 is in favor of the use of Gompertz equation as a descriptive tool. The higherlethality could be due to the higher median age of the Italian population (44.3 years) with respect to the Chinesepopulation (37.4 years) [12]. However further studies should be performed to investigate such a high lethality,i.e. in [13] it is suggested that the reasons could be found in the Italian extensive intergenerational contacts,which are supported by a high degree of residential proximity between adult children and their parents.Regarding the recovered people, it has to be said that Italy had an initial higher recovery kinetic, probably dueto the experience and treatments inherited from the Chinese case. At the end of the Italian epidemic the modelestimates that the 0.136% of the Italian population will be interested by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly and the World Health Organization (WHO)on the 11th of March declared a global pandemic. Despite in most of the cases (80%) COVID-19 presents mildsymptoms, in some cases the admission to intensive care units (ICU) and the use of mechanical ventilation arenecessary. These types of \u201cspecial treatments\u201d are limited and an uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic couldeasily overwhelm any health care system. In order to contain the outbreaks that are being developing in thewhole globe, the governments are taking drastic measures, locking down whole nations. The understanding ofthe dynamic of the epidemic could be useful to take decisions in time, preparing hospitals to deal with theinfection peak. The ongoing outbreaks are often described with simple fitting models, i.e. exponential functionsfunctions (and/or sigma-shaped curves such as Logistic or Gompertz, this last being the one to be preferablyused to fit the data), however in this work, exploiting the similarity between the almost extinguished Chineseepidemic and the relatively new Italian epidemic, a SIRD compartmental model was developed and used todescribe and predict the evolution of both the outbreaks. The advantages of SIRD models with respect toheuristic models reside mainly in the physical-based SIRD parameters, which can give useful insight and/orcan be properly chosen on the basis of physical-based assumptions. The present SIRD model was able todescribe the Chinese outbreak, obtaining the kinetic of infection, the kinetic of recovery as well as the kineticof death. Several modeling parameters obtained from the fitting of the Chinese epidemic were used withoutfurther modification for the Italian outbreak, considering the similarity of actions taken by the governments.Instead the best fit kinetic of infection in Italy was lower than the Chinese infection, probably because theItalian outbreaks are mainly based in small hospitals/cities, whereas the main Chinese outbreak was in themetropolitan city of Wuhan. The Italian epidemic showed instead a higher death kinetic, causing at the end ofinfection three times the Chinese death (modeling results). In conclusion the developed SIRD model predictsfor the Italian epidemic the infection peak between the end of March and the beginning of April 2020, withalmost 42,000 people infected at the same time and a number of death people at the end of the epidemic ofabout 10,000.1.
