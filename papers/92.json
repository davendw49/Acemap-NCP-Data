Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3'-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators. The recent appearance of clusters of a new coronaviral infection in Wuhan, China has made headlines, as more and more people have become infected in China and in a number of other countries. Already more than 100 deaths have been ascribed to this virus, and there are fears of additional outbreaks. The virus has been isolated from the lower respiratory tracts of patients with pneumonia, sequenced and visualized by electron microscopy (Zhu et al 2020). The virus, which has received the placeholder name 2019-nCoV, turns out to be a new member of the subgenus sarbecovirus, in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily, but is distinct from MERS CoV and SARS CoV (Zhu et al 2020). The coronaviruses are positive-sense, single strand RNA viruses, and thus share properties with other single-stranded RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus, West Nile virus, Marburg virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, dengue virus, and rhinoviruses. The coronavirus life cycle is depicted in Fig. 1, which is taken from a review by Zumla et al (2016). Briefly, the virus enters the cell by endocytosis, is uncoated and ORF1a and ORF1b of the + strand RNA is translated to produce nonstructural proteins, including a cysteine protease, a serine protease, helicase and RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The proteases cleave the precursor forms of the helicase and RdRp to form mature, functional molecules. A replication-transcription complex is then formed, which is responsible for making more copies of the RNA genome via a negative-sense intermediate, as well as the structural and other proteins encoded by the viral genome. The viral RNA is packaged into viral coats, attaches to the cell surface, after which exocytosis results in release of viral particles for subsequent infectious cycles. Potential inhibitors have been designed to attack nearly every stage of this process, as indicated in Fig. 1 (Zumla et al 2016). Despite decades of research, no effective drug is currently available to treat such serious coronavirus infections as SARS, MERS, and the symptoms caused by 2019-nCoV.", "text": "et al (2016) Nat Rev | Drug Discovery 15:327-347.One of the most important druggable targets is the RdRp. Example drugs include Gilead\u2019s sofosbuvir (whichis paired with velpatasvir as the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA), to inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymeraseof the hepatitis C virus. Sofosbuvir, a pyrimidine nucleotide analogue (Fig. 2) with a blocked phosphate groupenabling it to enter infected eukaryotic cells, is a prodrug, which is converted into its active triphosphate formby cellular enzymes (Fig. 3). The activated drug binds in the active site of the RdRp, where it is incorporatedinto RNA, and due to modifications at the 2\u2019 position, inhibits further RNA chain extension and halts RNAreplication. It acts as an RNA polymerase inhibitor by competing with natural ribonucleotides.Based on our insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replicationmechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA for the treatment of hepatitis C will alsoinhibit coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV and those responsible for SARS and MERS.There are many other RNA polymerase inhibitor drugs which are used as antivirals. A related purinenucleotide prodrug, remdesivir (Fig. 4), was developed by Gilead to treat Ebola virus infections, though notvery successfully, and is currently being considered for repositioning to treat the 2019-nCoV outbreak(https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gilead-mulls-repositioning-failed-ebola-drug-china-virus). Incontrast to sofosbuvir, both the 2\u2019- and 3\u2019-OH groups are unmodified, but a cyano group at the 1\u2019 positionpresumably serves to inhibit the RdRp in the active triphosphate form. Additional information on the ProTideProdrug technology is described by Alanazi et al (2019).A related prodrug analogue developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, BCX4430, also known as galidesivir (Fig.5), has been shown to inhibit RNA polymerases from a broad spectrum of RNA viruses, notably including thefiloviruses (e.g., Ebola, Marburg) in rodents and Marburg virus in macaques (Warren et al 2014). Upon entryinto infected cells, BCX4430 is rapidly phosphorylated, and the resulting nucleoside triphosphate serves asan RNA chain terminator.Based on the above background information, we describe here a novel strategy to design and synthesize viralpolymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvirwith the use of 3\u2019-blocking groups that we have built into nucleotide analogues that function as reversibleterminators for DNA sequencing (Ju et al 2003, Ju et al 2006, Guo et al 2008). We reasoned that (1) thephosphate masking groups will allow entry of the compounds into infected cells, (2) the 3\u2019- blocking groupon the 3\u2019-OH with either free 2\u2019-OH or modifications at the 2\u2019 position will encourage incorporation of theactivated triphosphate analogue by viral polymerases but not host cell polymerases, thus reducing any sideeffects, and (3) once incorporated, further extension will be prevented by virtue of the 3\u2019-blocking group,thereby inhibiting viral replication. These modified nucleotide analogues should be potent polymeraseinhibitors and thus active against various viral diseases, including but not limited to the coronaviruses suchas 2019-nCoV, and the strains causing SARS and MERS. Once incorporated, our newly designed nucleotideanalogues containing 3\u2019 blocking groups will permanently block further viral genome replication. This is incontrast to other nucleotide analogue-based viral inhibitors that have a free 3\u2019 OH group, which have thepossibility of allowing further polymerase extension, enabled by viral mutations. For the same reason, at highconcentrations, nucleotide analogue-based viral inhibitors with free 3\u2019 OH groups have the potential of beingincorporated by host polymerases.All RNA viruses are known to mutate at a high frequency, due to the low fidelity of the viral polymerase,resulting in the development of resistance to treatment. The promiscuous nature of the viral polymerase willallow incorporation of our newly designed nucleotide analogues as anti-viral agents.Examples of nucleotide analogues designed by us to satisfy these criteria are provided in Fig. 6, and strategiesfor their synthesis in Figs. 7-9; Fig. 10 shows the activation of these prodrugs to form triphosphate analogues(same as for sofosbuvir in Fig. 3) that should be incorporated and inhibit the coronavirus and other RNA viruspolymerases.methyl-3\u2019-O-methyladenosine nucleoside phosphoramidate as example.methylthiomethyluridine nucleoside phosphoramidate as example.synthesisof\u03b2-D-2\u02b9-deoxy-2\u02b9-\u03b1-fluoro-2\u02b9-\u03b2-C-methyl-3\u2019-O-allyluridinenucleosideSynthesis of 3\u2019-O-blocked nucleoside phosphoramidate prodrugs can be carried out starting from 2\u2019-modifiednucleosides (Ross et al 2011). First, both the 5\u2019-OH and the exocyclic amino group of the base will beprotected. Then the 3\u2019-OH will be derivatized with a variety of blocking groups, including methyl, ethyl,propyl, allyl, propargyl, methoxymethyl, methylthiomethyl, azidomethyl, etc., such as those listed in Fig.6,following established methods (Ju et al 2006, Guo et al 2008). After deprotection, the free 5\u2019-OH isderivatized to afford the corresponding phosphoramidates by treatment with freshly preparedchlorophosphoramidate reagent in the presence of N-methyl imidazole (Sofia et al 2010). Fig. 7 and Fig. 8show example synthetic routes for the 3\u2019-methoxy and 3\u2019-O-methylthiomethyl nucleoside phosphoramidateanalogs, respectively. Alternatively, starting from a 2\u2019-modified nucleoside, the 5\u2019-OH can be derivatized firstto give 5\u2019-phosphoramidate nucleotides, followed by 3\u2019-OH derivatization to afford 3\u2019-O blocked nucleosidephosphoramidate analogues. Fig. 9 shows an example synthetic route for 3\u2019-allyl nucleosidephosphoramidate analogues.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
