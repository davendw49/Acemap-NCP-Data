Up to February 9, 2020, 40,171 patients had been diagnosed with 2019-nCoV infection, including 6484 (16.14%) severe cases and 908 deaths (2.27%). Compared to SARS and MERS, 2019-nCoV appears to be much more contagious but less lethal, as most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis1,2. However, according to the Chinese government's daily report, 13.2-21.3% of patients with 2019-nCoV infection developed into severe or fatal illness (Fig. S1a), which is characterized by the rapid development to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or septic shock. Along with an increasing number of confirmed cases, the cumulative total of severe patients with 2019-nCoV is growing (Fig. S1b). Treatment of these critically ill patients is becoming one of the major challenges we are facing. Unfortunately, there are still no specific antiviral medicines or vaccines recommended for 2019-nCoV infection. For patients with severe clinical manifestations, an effective clinical treatment scheme is of great importance. On February 7, 2020, the China's National Health Commission released the fifth trial version of Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Pneumonitis with 2019-nCoV Infection, and provided a systematic treatment strategy for severe cases. Remarkably, systematic corticosteroids treatment (methylprednisolone, <1-2 mg per kg body weight, for 3-5 days) was recommended to be an adjuvant therapy3, which immediately raised concerns about whether patients infected with this novel coronavirus could benefit from corticosteroids therapy 4.", "text": "Corticosteroids are widely used to prevent lung injury caused bysevere community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) due to theirexcellent pharmacological effects on the suppression of exuberantand dysfunctional systematic inflammation5. Some scholars maynot support the corticosteroids treatment for novel coronaviruspneumonia (NCP), because observational studies and systematicreviews have indicated inconclusive clinical evidence on the effectof corticosteroids therapy for viral pneumonias (such as SARS,MERS and H1N1). Additionally, pulse-dose therapy or long-termadministration to high dose of corticosteroids in early stage werereported to be possibly harmful6\u20138. However, these conclusionsobscured the clinical benefits of corticosteroids on somesubgroups of patients, particularly those with severe symptoms,as the clinical effects might be related to the indication (severitiesof illness), the timing of intervention, the dose and duration ofcorticosteroids therapy9.Of note, as documented in a series of randomized clinical trials(RCT), low or physiologic dose of corticosteroids treatment did notreduce mortality from septic shock caused by primary lunginfections, but it could bring clinical benefits to secondaryoutcomes, such as earlier reversal of shock, shorter duration toexit from ICU and mechanical ventilation9,10. Besides, salvagecorticosteroids treatment for severe patients with advanced ARDScould alleviate the pulmonary fibrosis and prevent progressivepathological deterioration11, which provides a good framework forexplaining why some critical patients with SARS infection benefitfrom rescue corticosteroids therapy. More importantly, mortalitybenefit favored the severe HIN1-illness in the adjunctive treatmentgroup with low dose of corticosteroids12. Evidently, all theseresults strongly suggest that proper use of low-dosecorticosteroids may bring survival advantages for critically ill patients with2019-nCoV, but this treatment should be strictly performed onNCP patients with definite clinical indications (such as refractoryARDS, sepsis or septic shock) according to the recommendedguidelines.Over the past month, we collaborated with front-line ICU physiciansand firstly evaluated the efficacy of corticosteroids treatment forsevere or fatal cases with 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan. FromJanuary 1 to January 29, 2020, the first 15 confirmed critical NCPpatients with an average age of 61.7 years were admitted to the ICUin Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Of the 15 patients, 15 (100.0%)showed bilateral pneumonia, hypoxemia and moderate or severeARDS, 14 (93.3%) had infections, 8 (53.3%) accompanied by shockand 9 (60.0%) with multiple organ injuries. All patients had receivedtreatments containing noninvasive oxygen therapy and antibioticsand/or antiviral agents before and after ICU admission, andhypoxemia was not improved by these treatments. According tothe guidelines, corticosteroids therapy (medianhydrocortisoneequivalent dose of 400.0 mg/day) was instantly initiated after ICUadmission for an average of 9.5 days, and outcomes for all patientswere followed up until February 9, 2020 (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1c). Briefly,we observed that ICU mortality of these severe or fatal NCP patientswas 46.7% (7/15), closer to that after adjustment for time-varyingconfounders induced by critically ill patients with MERS withoutcorticosteroids treatment6, suggesting that corticosteroids might notimprove ICU mortality in critical NCP patients. But meanwhile,systematic corticosteroids therapy in the first 3\u22125 days couldenhance oxygen saturation (SaO2) and arterial oxygen tension(PaO2)/inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2), both of which could befurther augmented by collaborating with invasive mechanicalventilation (IMV) (Fig. 1b). Corticosteroids did not exert anyintervention efficacy on survival advantage of NCP patientscomplicated with both ARDS and shock or multiple organ injury(seven patients, all dead). Nevertheless, corticosteroids treatment inthe phase of ARDS would effectively inhibit furious inflammatorystorm (Fig. 1b) and gain valuable time for controlling infection andpreventing secondary multiorgan damage and shock, which impliesthat corticosteroids have synergistic biological effects whencombined with other intensivists\u2019 treatment against severe or fatalNCP patients.Due to the deficiency of sample size and a matched controlgroup, we could not easily draw an accurate conclusion about therole of corticosteroids in patients with 2019-nCoV by now.However, our clinical experience and available descriptive datafrom the therapeutic process of the first 15 critical NCP patientsare prone to support corticosteroids treatment for specificsubgroup of critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV.There is no fixed clinical guideline for the use of corticosteroids incritically ill patients in ICU. The anecdotal experience from SARSand sCAP therapy strongly supports precise corticosteroidsmanagement of NCP. Personalized medicine strategy shouldcontain, but not limited to, specific indications, timing andduration, as well as therapeutic monitoring of corticosteroidstherapy. As mentioned above, corticosteroids should be avoidedunless there are indications for moderate or severe ARDS, sepsis orseptic shock, in part consistent with the recommended clinicalguidance from World Health Organization (WHO). We also do notsuggest the use of corticosteroids for mild or early-stage ARDS,because early corticosteroids application could delay theclearance of virus and increase mortality risk, and corticosteroids aremore likely to function on inflammation-mediated lung injury andinterstitial fibro-proliferation at late-stage of ARDS11. Furthermore,clinical adverse complications in SARS patients withcorticosteroids treatment have been reported to be dose-related. Over240 mg of hydrocortisone-equivalent dose or an excessivecumulative dose was considered to be able to generate someside effects, including hyperglycemia, psychosis, and secondaryinfection, avascular necrosis9,10. Hence, lower dose and shortduration of corticosteroids treatment (methylprednisolone,<1 mg/kg body weight, no more than 7 days), along with adversedrug reaction monitoring, would be more beneficial in clinicalmanagement of critical patients with 2019-nCoV. In addition, along-term follow-up (6 months to 3 years) is essential to identifydelayed adverse effects in these patients. Of course, the optimaltreatment strategy requires constant adjustment as patient\u2019sclinical performance changes.In conclusion, Chinese government has taken effectivemeasures to prevent a possible national or worldwide 2019-nCoVpandemic. Offering the most reasonable treatment to severe NCPpatients could be another challenge we will face. We endorse thepotential benefits from low-dose corticosteroids treatment in asubset of critically ill patients with 2019-nCoV based on existingstudies and clinical experience, despite there is no significantimprovement in overall survival. Certainly, our ongoingwelldesigned prospective cohort study with sufficient samples mayprovide systematic answers to this clinical dilemma\u2014\u201cto use ornot to use corticosteroids for the treatment of lung injury with2019-nCoV\u201d\u2014in the near future.(2020) 5:18We thank all medical staff working in the Intensive Care Unit of Wuhan PulmonaryHospital for their essential assistance with case collection.
