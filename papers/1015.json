This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative realtime reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested.", "text": "RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infectedby SARS coronavirus as a positive control, theseassays were shown to have a dynamic range of at leastseven orders of magnitude (2x10 4-2000TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards,the detection limits of these assays were found to bebelow 10 copies per reaction. All negative controlsamples were negative in the assays. Samples from two2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in thetests.CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve arapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples,thereby allowing early identification of patients.Coronaviruses can be classified into 4 genera (a, b, c,and d) and these viruses are detected in a wide range ofanimal species, including humans (1). There are 6previously known human coronaviruses that can betransmitted between humans. Human alphacoronaviruses, 229Eand NL63, and betacoronaviruses, OC43 and HKU1,are common respiratory viruses usually causing mildupper respiratory diseases. In contrast to these, the other 2human beta-coronaviruses, SARS and MERScoronaviruses, are highly pathogenic in humans. The case fatalityrates of SARS and MERS are about 10% and 35%,respectively (2, 3). SARS and MERS can be transmittedbetween humans and may cause major outbreaks inhealth care settings or in community settings. BothSARS and MERS coronaviruses are of zoonotic origins.MERS coronavirus is widely circulated in dromedarycamels. Over 90% of dromedary camels in Middle Eastcountries are seropositive for MERS coronavirus (4, 5).Because of such a high prevalence in this animal species,sporadic zoonotic transmissions of MERS coronavirusfrom camels to humans have been repeatedly detectedin the affected region since its discovery in 2012. Forthe SARS outbreak in 2003, exotic mammals in wetmarkets, such as palm civets and raccoon dogs, arebelieved to be the animal sources of the virus (6). Thedetection of SARS coronavirus in these species led to atemporary ban of selling of these animals in 2004,thereby preventing additional spill-over events fromanimals to humans. But further surveillance studiesindicated that these animals are rarely positive for SARScoronavirus in non-market settings, suggesting that theyonly served as intermediate hosts in the SARS event (1,7). Subsequent virus surveillances in wild animalsidentified a vast number of coronaviruses in bats (8).Interestingly, several bat coronaviruses that aregenetically similar to human SARS coronavirus were detectedin horseshoe bats. This group of SARS-like batcoronaviruses, together with SARS coronavirus, form a uniqueclade under the subgenus Sarbecovirus. It is nowgenerally believed that SARS coronavirus is a recombinantvirus between several bat SARS-like beta-coronaviruses(9). Some of these bat coronaviruses are experimentallycapable of infecting human cells in cultures (9),suggesting that these animal viruses and their recombinants canpose threats to human health.        In December 2019, a cluster of atypical pneumoniapatients epidemiologically linked to a wholesale marketin Wuhan was detected (10). A novel beta-co        In this study, we report the development ofRTPCR assays to detect this novel virus in human clinicalspecimens.          Two monoplex real-time RT-PCR assays targeting theORF1b and N gene regions of 2019-nCoV weredesigned based on the first publicly available sequencein Genbank (Accession number: MN908947). Thedownloaded sequence and those for SARS coronavirus,bat SARS-like coronaviruses, and other representativecoronaviruses were edited and aligned. Phylogeneticanalyses of these sequences were performed using theneighbor joining method in MEGA X (14). Twosequence regions (ORF1b and N) that are highlyconserved amongst sarbecoviruses were selected for primerand probe designs. The primer and probe sequences forthe ORF1b gene assay are: 5\u2019-TGGGGYTTTACRGGTAACCT-3\u2019 (Forward; Y \u00bc C/T, R \u00bc A/G), 5\u2019-AACRCGCTTAACAAAGCACTC-3\u2019 (Reverse; R \u00bc A/G)and 50-TAGTTGTGATGCWATCATGACTAG-30(Probe in 5\u2019-FAM/ZEN/3\u2019-IBFQ format; W \u00bc A/T),whereas the primer and probe sequences for the N geneassay are: 50-TAATCAGACAAGGAACTGATTA-30(Forward), 50-CGAAGGTGTGACTTCCATG-30(Reverse) and 50-GCAAATTGTGCAATTTGCGG-30(Probe in 5\u2019-FAM/ZEN/3\u2019-IBFQ format). The expectedamplicon sizes of ORF1b and N gene assays are 132 bpand 110 bp, respectively. All primers and probes werepurchased from a commercial source (Integrated DNATechnologies). The primer and probe sequences weresubsequently confirmed to have perfect matches withother 2019-nCoV genome sequences available fromGlobal Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data          A typical 20 mL monoplex RT-PCR assay contained5 lL of 4X master reaction mixture (TaqMan Fast Virus1-Step Master Mix, ThermoFisher), 0.5 mmol/L offorward primer, 0.5 lmol/L of reverse primer, 0.25 lmo/Lof probe, and 4 ll of RNA sample. RT-PCR reactionswere conducted by a thermal cycler (ViiA7 Real-TimePCR system, ThermoFisher) with the followingconditions: reverse transcription at 50 C for 5 min,inactivation of reverse transcriptase at 95 C for 20 s, 40 cyclesof PCR amplification (Denaturing at 95 C for 5 s;Annealing/Extending at 60 C for 30 s). The time foreach RT-PCR run was about 1 h and 15 min.Viral RNA purification kit (QIAamp Viral RNAMini Kit, Qiagen) and DNA plasmid purification kit(QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, Qiagen) were used forRNA and DNA extractions, respectively, as instructedby the manufacturer. For all RNA extractions, RNA wasextracted from 140 mL of sample and eluted in 60 mLelution buffer containing poly(A) carrier RNA.Viral RNA extracted from SARS coronavirus-infectedcells was used for positive controls. In addition, theRTPCR products of SARS coronavirus generated by theORF1b and N gene assays were cloned into plasmids.Serially diluted RNA or DNA samples were used toevaluate the performance of these assays. To determinethe specificity of these assays, negative control sampleswere tested. These negative control samples were: 1)RNA extracted from cultured viruses: humancoronaviruses (229E, OC43, and MERS), camel coronavirus(HKU23), human influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2,H5N1, and H7N9 subtypes), avian influenza (H1, H4,H6, and H9 subtypes), influenza B viruses (Yamagataand Victoria lineages), and adenovirus, 2) RNAextracted from retrospective human respiratoryspecimens previously tested positive for coronavirus (229E,HKU1, NL63, OC43), influenza A viruses (H1N1 andH3N2 subtypes), influenza B viruses (Yamagata andVictoria lineages), adenovirus, enterovirus, humanparainfluenza virus (PIV1, 2, 3 and 4), respiratory syncytialvirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and humanbocavirus, and 3) RNA extracted from sputum samplesfrom patients without respiratory viral infections(n \u00bc 9). Culture supernatants of infected cells or clinicalsamples stored in standard virus transport media weresubjected to a brief centrifugation (15,170 g, 2 min)and 140 mL of supernatant from each sample was usedfor RNA extraction.Two patients (Patients 1 and 2) suspected to beinfected by 2019-nCoV in Beijing were included in thisstudy. For Patient 1, a sputum sample was collected atday 5 post-onset of symptoms. The sputum samplestored in standard virus transport media was treatedwith an equal volume of Sputasol (ThermoFisher)before RNA extraction. For Patient 2, a throat swabsample was collected at day 3 post-onset of symptoms andstored in standard virus transport media. 140 mL of eachaqueous sample was used for viral RNA extraction.Relevant clinical and epidemiological data for bothpatients were not accessible to this study. RNA extractedfrom these samples were serially diluted and tested bythe assays.At the time of preparing this assay, there was only oneviral sequence available from the public domain. Withsuch a limited sequence information, we decided todevelop two RT-PCR assays that can react with multiplecoronaviruses that are in the subgenus Sarbecovirus(Fig. 1A; see discussion). Using additional sequenceinformation from this clade of coronaviruses, we selectedhighly conserved ORF1b and N gene regions as ourtargets (Fig. 1B). These designs allow the use of nucleicacids derived from SARS coronavirus as positivecontrols.Viral RNA from cells infected by SARS coronavirus orDNA plasmids containing the target sequences werepositive in the assays as expected. Using viral RNAextracted from virus cultures with known titers, bothassays have a dynamic range of at least seven orders ofmagnitude (2 x 10 4-2000 TCID50/reaction; data notshown). To accurately determine the detection limits ofthese assays, we also tested serially diluted positivecontrol plasmids in these assays. In our preliminary trial,reactions with 10 copies of this positive controlplasmid were consistently positive in both of the assays(n \u00bc 5). The DNA amplifications of these newlyestablished assays were found to be efficient. Theamplification efficiencies of ORF1b and N gene assays were99.6% and 95.4%, respectively (Fig. 2, R2 > 0.99 inboth cases).All negative controls were found to be negative inthese assays (data not shown). In addition, we alsospiked known amounts of SARS coronavirus intorepresentative negative control samples (10-fold seriallydiluted virus sample; range: 2 x 10 4-2000 TCID50/reaction; Number of tests per concentration: 1). RNAextracted from these spiked samples were all positive inthe tests, with no significant RT-PCR inhibitiondetected.Respiratory specimens from two suspected patients weretested by both RT-PCR assays. Both patients werepositive in the tests (Table 1). Preliminary results fromserially diluted RNA samples suggested that the N geneassay is about 10 times more sensitive than the ORF-1bgene assay in detecting positive clinical specimens. Asthese samples could only be tested qualitatively by theseassays at the testing site, the exact viral copy numbers inthese specimens cannot be determined.In this study, two assays targeting the viruses in thesubgenus Sarbecovirus were made and evaluated. Weintentionally made these assays to be reactive to multipleviruses in this subgenus. This is because there isinsufficient public information about the genetic diversity of2019-nCoV in humans and animals. In 2003, SARScoronaviruses found in palm civets and humans weregenetically highly similar, but distinct. For example, apartial deletion was detected in SARS coronavirus found inpalm civets (6). Similar subtle sequence variations werealso observed in MERS coronavirus found in camelsand humans (15). To avoid the possible scenario inwhich the genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV is muchmore diverse than appreciated, our primer and probesets were designed to react with this clade ofcoronaviruses.We evaluated our assays using a panel of positiveand negative control samples. The assays were found tobe sensitive and specific to only sarbecoviruses. Wefurther used respiratory specimens from patients infectedby 2019-nCoV to demonstrate the potential use of thesetests. The tested clinical samples were different in nature(sputum vs. throat swab) and they were collected atdifferent onset times (day 5 vs. day 3). Thus, it ispremature to use these data to determine the viral replicationDownloadedfromhttps://academi.coup.com/clinchem/advanceailtrceabstract/doi/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa029/5719336bygueston26March2020991001000.10100100100100 100100100100surivocebraS\u03b2\u03b1\u03b3403530eu 25la 20vt 15C1050403530elu25va20tC151050Orf1b assayLog10 copy numberLog10 copy numberkinetics in humans. Further systematic investigations onclinical specimens collected from 2019-nCoV-infectedpatients at different post-onset time points will beneeded. Nonetheless, the results demonstrated theclinical value of these respiratory samples for moleculardetection of 2019-nCoV. In addition, the N geneRTPCR assay was found to be more sensitive in detecting2019-nCoV RNA in the studied clinical samples. It ispossible that these clinical samples might containinfected cells expressing subgenomic mRNA (16),resulting in more N gene copies in the samples.With the exception of 2019-nCoV and SARScoronavirus, none of the sarbecoviruses have been previouslydetected in humans. SARS was eliminated in humansand the last reported human SARS case was detected in2004 (17). Individuals with samples that are positive inthese RT-PCR assays should be considered to beinfected by the 2019-nCoV or its related animalcoronaviruses. Based on their detection performances, the Ngene RT-PCR is recommended as a screening assay, andthe Orf1b assay is recommended as a confirmatory one.Using a diagnostic algorithm similar to MERS, an Ngene positive/Orf1b negative result should be regardedas indeterminate and the case is recommended to bereferred to a WHO reference lab for further testing (18).In the event of having positive PCR results, sequenceanalyses of positive amplicons can help to confirm theresult and to distinguish between 2019-nCoV and othergenetically related coronaviruses (e.g., SARScoronavirus).The biosafety classification of 2019-nCoV is yet tobe fully defined. Clinical samples for molecular tests arerecommended to be handled using biosafety level 2practices (19). As SARS coronavirus is classified as abiosafety level 3 (BSL3) pathogen, we thereforeintentionally used DNA plasmids as positive controls in thesetests. This can avoid distributing SARS coronavirusgenomic RNA which has the potential of generatinginfectious clones via reverse genetics. In addition, this canalso help to distribute positive controls to laboratories atdifferent geographical regions in a more cost-effectiveand robust manner. These DNA plasmid controls areavailable upon request.6During the reviewing process of this manuscript,Corman and colleagues reported the use syntheticconstructs and SARS virus to develop RT-PCR assays for2019-nCoV detection (20).Nonstandard Abbreviations: TCID50, Median tissue cultureinfectious dose; SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; MERS,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.Disclosures: Author Contributions: All authors confirmed they havecontributed to the intellectual content of this paper and have met thefollowing 4 requirements: (a) significant contributions to the conception anddesign, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (b)drafting or revising the article for intellectual content; (c) final approval ofthe published article; and (d) agreement to be accountable for all aspects ofthe article thus ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrityof any part of the article are appropriately investigated and resolved.K.
