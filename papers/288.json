Ocial Data of COVID-19 CasesThe availability of o cial data of infected cases in China varies from city to city. Wuhan, being the epicenter, hasthe first confirmed case of COVID-19 infection on December 8, 2019 [1]. Most other cities in China began to reportcases of COVID-19 infections around mid January 2020. Our data of daily infected and recovered cases, and deathtolls, are based on the o cial data released by the National Health Commission of China, and the daily data used inour study are from January 24, 2020, to February 16, 2020, including the daily total number of confirmed cases ineach city, daily total cumulative number of confirmed cases in each city, daily cumulative number of recovered casesin each city, and daily cumulative death toll in each city. It should be emphasized that the o cial data may not bethe actual (true) data. Although the earliest confirmed case appeared on December 8, 2019, subsequent missing caseswere expected to be significant in Hubei Province in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak. Systematic updates of40030020010050040030020010015010050210Jan20infection data in other cities began after January 17, 2020. Figure 2 shows the number of confirmed infected cases,recovered cases and death tolls of six major Chinese cities.As human-to-human transmission has been confirmed to occur in the spreading of COVID-19, gatherings ofpeople and intercity travel of infected and exposed individuals within China have been the main drives that escalatethe spreading of the virus. The period (around 20 days) surrounding the Lunar New Year (mid January to earlyFebruary in 2020) is the most important holiday period in China. Migrant workers and students travel from majorcities to country towns for family reunions, and return to the cities at the end of the holiday period. Holiday goersalso travel to and from tourist cities. China\u2019s Ministry of Transport estimates around 3 billion trips to be taken duringthis period. Wuhan, being a major transport hub and having a large number of higher education institutions as well asmanufacturing plants, is among the cities with the largest outflow and inflow tra c before and after the Chinese NewYear festival. Our study aims to incorporate these important human migration dynamics in the construction of thespreading model. We collect daily intercity travel data in China from Baidu Migration, which is a mobile-app basedbig data system recording movements of mobile phone users. Specifically, we have collected Baidu Migration datafor 367 cities (or administrative regions) in China over the period of January 1, 2020, to February 13, 2020. The dataprovide the migration strengths of cities which are indicative measures of the human tra c volume moving in and outof individual cities and administrative regions, as depicted by the inflow and outflow networks shown in Figure 3(a).          Based on the collected data, we construct the migration matrix, which is given as2 m11(t)6 m21(t)M(t) = 6 :64 ::mN1(t)m12(t)m22(t):::mN2(t): : :m1K (t) 3m2K (t) 7: 7 ;:: 75mKK (t)(          Number of outflow migrants of city i at time t isNumber of inflow migrants of city i at time t isKmi(out)(t) = X mi j(t):i= j          Kmi(in)(t) = X m ji(t):j=1(          3.1. ModelIn the SEIR model, each individual in a population may assume one of four possible states at any time in thedynamic process of epidemic spreading, namely, susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I) and recovered/removed(R). The dynamics of the epidemic can be described by the following set of equations: S\u02d9 (t) = S (t)I(t), E\u02d9 (t) =S (t)I(t) kE(t), I\u02d9(t) = E(t) I(t), and R\u02d9 (t) = I(t), where S (t), E(t), I(t) and R(t) are, respectively, the number ofpeople susceptible to the disease, exposed (being able to infect others but having no symptoms), infected (diagnosedas confirmed cases), and recovered (including death cases); is the exposition rate (infection rate of susceptibleindividuals); is the infection rate of exposed individuals; and is the recovery rate. For simplicity, recoveredindividuals include patients recovered from the disease and death tolls. In discrete form, the SEIR model can berepresented byS (t)E(t)I(t)R(t)====S (tS (tE(tI(t1)I(t1)I(t1)1)1);1)I(tE(t1);1);where S (t) = S (t) S (t 1), E(t) = E(t) E(t 1), I(t) = I(t) I(t 1), and R(t) = R(t) R(t 1), with t beinga daily count. As the incubation period for COVID-19 can be up to 14 days, the number of exposed individuals (whoshow no symptom but are able to infect others) plays a crucial role in the spreading of the disease. The state E, whichis not available from the o cial data, is thus an important state in our model. Furthermore, combining death toll withthe recovered number as state R will simplify the computation without a ecting the accuracy of our data fitting andsubsequent estimation.Suppose, for city i, the four states are S i(t), Ei(t), Ii(t) and Ri(t), at time t. Here, we also define a total susceptiblepopulation, Nis, which is the eventual number of infected individuals in city i. Moreover, if city i has a population ofPi and the eventual percentage of infection is i, then Nis = iPi. Thus, we haveNis(t) = S i(t) + Ei(t) + Ii(t) + Ri(t):The classic SEIR model would give Ii as the di erence between the number of exposed individuals who becomeinfected and the number of removed individuals. However, the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic has occurred ina special period of time in China, during which a huge migration tra c is being carried among cities, leading to ahighly rapid transmission of the disease throughout the country. In view of this special migration factor, the SEIRmodel should incorporate the human migration dynamics in order to capture the essential features of the dynamics ofthe spreading. In particular, for city i, in addition to the abovementioned classic interpretation, the daily increase in thenumber of infected cases should also include the inflow of infected individuals from other cities, less the outflow ofremoved cases from city i. In reality, inflow and outflow of exposed individuals to and from the city are also importantand to be estimated in the model. Thus, if mi j(t) people move from city i to city j on day t, and the population of cityi is Pi(t), then the number of infected individuals moving from city i to city j isAlso, the number of migrants leaving from city j is PN        i=1 m ji, and the number of infected cases that have migrated outof city j iswhere P j(t) is the population of city j on day t. Thus, the increase in infected cases on day t in city j is given by(        S j(t) = S j(t + 1)S j(t). Finally, we havewhereR j(t) = R j(t + 1)        R j(t). In the above derivation, we should note thatWe thus implement this condition by writing (        1 is a constant representing the possibility of an infected individual moving from one city to another.Likewise, incorporating the migrant dynamics, the increase in exposed individuals on day t in city j isj(t)N s(t)jj(t)N s(t)jE j(t) =I j(t)S j(t) +E j(t), j is the infection rate of susceptible individuals in city j, andj is the infection rateof exposed individuals in city j. In a likewise fashion, we havej(t)N s(t)jj(t)N s(t)jthe recovered individuals are assumed to stay in city j;the recovery rates in di erent cities are assumed to be di erent due to varied quality of treatments andavailability of medical facilities;the recovery rates increase as time goes, as treatment methods are expected to improve gradually (i.e., takingj(t) as a monotonically increasing function);the evetual recovery rates in all cities will converge to the same constant1.In addition, due to intercity migration, the population of city j on day t would increase or decrease according toP j(t) =NX \u0081 Pi(t)mi j(t) \u008bPi(t)P j(t) PN        i=1 m ji(t)(        In summary, our modified SEIR model with consideration of human migration dynamics, for city j, is given by8>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>:where subscript j denotes the city itself, and subscript i denotes another city from/to which people migrate on dayt. Letting X j(t) be the extended state vector, i.e., X j(t) = [S j(t) E j(t) I j(t) R j(t) P j(t) N sj(t)]T , we write the abovedi erence equation aswhere f (x) is the right side of (15), and j is the set of parameters includingconvenience, we write (15) asX j(t) = f (X j; Xi; i)X j(t + 1) = X j(t) + f (X j; Xi; i)In performing the data fitting, we assume j(t), j(t), j(t), j(t), andspreading, and the spreading begins at t0, at which N sj(t0) = jP j(t0).j, j, j, j and j. For computationalj are constants throughout the period ofwhere I j;0 = I j(t0) is the initial number of infections in city j, and f j; j; j; j; jg are parameters that determine therates of spreading and recovery in city j. Then, the unknown set is = f 1; 2; ; K g essentially has 5K unknowns,where K is the number of cities, thus requiring an enormous e ort of computation. Here, to gain computationale ciency, we assume thatall cities share one parameter set= f ; ; ; g;the numbers of initial infected and exposed individuals in city i are I Ii(t0) andand E are constant;each city has an independent i.E Ii(t0), respectively, where I(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)Then, the size of the unknown set becomes computationally manageable, i.e.,Finally, the parameter estimation problem can be formulated as the following constrained nonlinear optimizationproblem:= f ; ; ; ; i; I ; E g:NP0: min Pj=0\u00a7 (i)s:t: (ii)w j(I(t j)I\u02c6(t j)) lx\u02c6(t + 1) = x\u02c6(t) + F(x\u02c6(t));U L;where F( ) represents model (15) and x\u02c6(t) = [I\u02c6(t); R\u02c6 (t); E(t); S (t); P(t); N s(t)] is the set of estimated variables, withunknown set , which is bounded between L and U . In this work, an inverse approach is taken to find the unknownparameters and states by solving (19).The Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) is adopted as the criterion, i.e., fitting error, to measure thedi erence between the number of infected individuals generated by the model and the o cial daily infection data.RMSPE =\u00cc1 X X \u0082 I\u02c6i(t j)K i=1 j=1Ii(t j)Ii(t j) \u008c2100%;where K is the number of cities to be evaluated.We perform data fitting of the model, described by (17), using historical daily infection data provided by theNational Health Commission of China, from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020. Our approach, as described inthe previous section, is to apply constrained nonlinear programming to find the best set of estimates for the unknownparameters and states. Data fitting for all 367 cities are performed. Values are updated iteratively in the optimizationprocess. Moreover, since all parameters, like infection rates, are to be generated by fitting data with the model, theintegrity of the data becomes crucial. As the o cial Wuhan data are expected to deviate from the true values quitesignificantly during the early outbreak stage due to uncertainty in diagnosis and other issues related to reporting of theepidemic by the local government, we have allowed the fitting errors for Wuhan to expand over a reasonable range,while the fitting errors for most other cities remain small. In addition, as the epidemic propagates in time, e ectivecontrol measures and improved public education would reduce the infection rates for the susceptible and exposedindividuals, making these parameters time varying in reality. Nonetheless, our fitting assumes these parameters beingconstant during the short fitting period for computational simplicity.The propagation profiles, in terms of the number of infected individuals and estimated number of exposedindividuals, for all 367 cities are estimated. As limited by space, we only show in Figure 5 the results for 20 selected cities.This model can also provide projections of the number of infected and exposed individuals in the next 200 days, asshown in Figure 6, which clearly show that the daily infection would reach a peak sooner or later. By running theidentification algorithm, we identify the optimal parameter set as = 0:5869, = 0:8949, = 0:1008, and = 0:0602.From the estimated propagation profiles of the COVID-19 epidemic for all 367 cities, we have the following findings:For most cities in China, the infection numbers will peak between mid February to early March 2020, as shownin Figure 7(a).The peak number of infected individuals will be between 1,000 to 5,000 for cities in Hubei, and that outsideHubei will be below 500, as shown in Figure 7(b).At the end, about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population will get infected in Wuhan, HubeiProvince and the rest of China, respectively, as graphically presented in Figure 7(c).results are expected to be conservative, under normal circumstances, in the sense that the severity and duration of theepidemic could be over-estimated. This is because stringent measures have been taken to limit travel and hence to curbthe spreading of the virus since late January 2020. The infection rates should be progressively reduced, with the e ectof reducing the number of infected individuals as well as mitigating of the peak times. Furthermore, climate factorsmay also play a role in the epidemic spreading. As temperature generally rises from February to May, the infectionpeaks would unlikely occur later than the predicted times as the new coronavirus epidemic is generally known tosubside in warm weather. Based on our findings and assuming no drastic change in infection rates (e.g., schools andworkplaces remain closed and intercity travel limited), we can conclude, with optimism, that the COVID-19 epidemicwould end around April 2020.We employ human migration data to provide information on intercity travel that is crucial to the transmission ofthe new coronavirus disease from its epicenter Wuhan to other parts of China. Our model for the disease spreading isessentially the classic SEIR model, with intercity travel data supplying the essential information about the number ofinfected, exposed and recovered individuals moving between di erent cities. All parameters of the model, includinginfection rates, recovery rates, and eventual percentage of infected population for 367 cities in China, are identified byfitting the o cial data with the model using a constrained nonlinear programming procedure. Using these parameters,estimates of the number of exposed individuals in 367 cities as well as projections into the next 200 days are alsofound. Our model, however, does not consider the contact network topology that would be necessary if details ofthe transmission process, such as superspreading events, are to be captured. Nonetheless, our model provides a veryreasonable estimation of the propagation of average numbers of exposed, infected and recovered individuals, despitemissing details of fluctuation (e.g., sudden surge due to a superspreading event). The main conclusion of our study isthat the COVID-19 epidemic spreading will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0:8%, lessthan 0:1% and less than 0:01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China,respectively.This work was supported by National Science Foundation of China Project 61703355 and Guangdong YouthUniversity Innovative Talents Project 2016KQNCX223, and City University of Hong Kong under Special Fund 9380114provided by VP(RT).", "ref_list": [[], ["Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan China of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia"], [""], ["Epidemic spreading in scale-free networks"], ["Absence of epidemic threshold in scale-free networks with degree correlations"], ["Super-spreaders and the rate of transmission of the SARS virus"], ["Small world and scale free network model of transmission of SARS"], ["Clustering model for transmission of the SARS virus: Application to epidemic control and risk assessment"], ["Epidemic spreading in real networks: An eigenvalue viewpoint"], ["Epidemic thresholds in real networks"], ["Epidemic dynamics on an adaptive network"], ["Risk of transportation of 2019 novel coronavirus disease from Wuhan to other cities in China"], [""], ["AI predicts coronavirus could infect 2.5 billion and kill 53 million"], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], ["Q.
