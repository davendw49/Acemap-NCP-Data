Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacityof RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, wedeveloped and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virusof COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed. We also adapteda colorimetric detection method for our RT-LAMP assay so that the tests potentially performed in higherSARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral pathogen of COVID-19 of which the outbreaks resulted in106,893 confirmed cases involving 3,639 deaths over 103 countries, areas or territories as of 07 Marchsyndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), namely subgenus Sarbecovirus, showing 96% identityto a bat coronavirus [2, 3].        Diagnosis of COVID-19 can be done through CT scan of suspicious patients and confirmatorylab test is performed using RT-qPCR methods [        To overcome such cost-restriction of RT-qPCR and still detect pathogens\u2019 nucleic acids,isothermal amplification methods have been developed [10]. Among such methods, Loop-mediatedisothermal amplification (LAMP) method has some advantages to be applied for point-of-care test(POCT) [11]. Well optimized LAMP assay shows sensitivity comparable to that of PCR, less than 10copies per reaction [12]. Intercalating fluorescent dyes are compatible with LAMP reaction so that wecan observe amplification in real-time [13]. Because amplification efficiency of LAMP reaction is veryhigh, changes in reaction mixture components made it possible to detect the result with colorimetricdetection methods [14-16]. Moreover, unpurified sample can be directly used for LAMP [17-19]. Thisindicates that high-throughput test is possible when use of unpurified specimen is combined withnoninstrumental (e.g. colorimetric) detection.In this study, we designed and evaluated one-step reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP)methods to detect SARS-CoV-2. We provide a pair of LAMP primer sets that is specific to SARS-CoV-2and accompanying optimized reaction conditions. To achieve colorimetric detection of LAMP reaction,leuco crystal violet (LCV) method is applied [15].SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was prepared as previously described [20]. hCoV-229E andhCoVOC43 viral RNA were isolated from culture media of infected MRC-5 cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-171\u2122).MERSCoV RNA was isolated from cell pellet lysate of infected Vero cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-81\u2122).In vitro transcribed standard RNA for SARS-CoV-2 was prepared as previously described [20].To prepare standard RNA for hCoV-229E, first amplicon of PCR (Forward primer: 5\u2019 \u2013was prepared by restriction enzyme cut with BglI and XhoI and purification after agarose gelelectrophoresis. For hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, amplicons of PCR (OC43 forward primer: 5\u2019 \u2013AGCAACCAGGCTGATGTCAATACC \u2013 3\u2019, OC43 reverse primer: 5\u2019 \u2013AGCAGACCTTCCTGAGCCTTCAAT \u2013 3\u2019, MERS-CoV: UpE region [21]) were synthesized and clonedto pBIC-A plasmid (Bioneer). In vitro transcription template for hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV wereprepared by restriction enzyme cut with BamHI-XhoI or SspI-XhoI, respectively. In vitro transcriptionswere done with EZ\u2122 T7 High Yield In Vitro Transcription kit (Enzynomics) as manufacturer\u2019sinstructions. RNA products were then purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP (Beckman Coulter).Standard RNA copy numbers were calculated from concentration measured by NanoDrop Lite (ThermoScientific). All restriction enzymes were purchased from Enzynomics.To evaluate genomic copy number of viral RNAs, dilutions of standard RNAs and viral RNAs inTE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) are subjected to one-step RT-qPCR. RT-qPCRreactions were carried out using LightCycler 96 instrument and following reagents: Luna UniversalOneStep RT-qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs, NEB) for hCoV-229E and hCoV-OC43, THUNDERBIRDProbe qPCR Master Mix (Toyobo) for MERS-CoV and Luna Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR Kit(NEB) for SARS-CoV-2.cDNA of SARS-CoV-2 was made using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)following manufacturer\u2019s instructions with modifications. Briefly, 10 pmol of random hexamer was usedas reverse transcription primer and reaction was performed as follow: 20 minutes at 25\u2103, 30 minutes at55\u2103 and 10 minutes at 80\u2103.LAMP reaction was performed with reaction mixture containing following components: 1.6 \u03bcMsame concentrations of primers and 0.4 \u03bcM SYTO-9 were added. Isothermal incubation andfluorescence signal measurement was performed using LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche) at 69\u2103 withadditional heat inactivation (5 minutes at 95\u2103) and melting curve analysis steps. Fluorescence signalswere measured for every minute during 60 (screening and optimization) or 30 (Limit of Detection andcross-reactivity) minutes of incubation. Any changed conditions are specified for each experiment.design are manually selected: two regions from Nsp3 (3055 \u2013 3591, 6172 \u2013 7273), two regions fromSpike (S) (21540 \u2013 22549, 22890 \u2013 23779), and one region from Orf8 (27824 \u2013 28396). WholeNucleocapsid (N) gene region is also included as N is usual target of molecular diagnosis due toabundance of its mRNA.[23] Two to five basic LAMP primer sets are designed and selected withPrimerExplorer V5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) for each target region. Loop primersare designed by PrimerExplorer V5 or manually selected. 16 LAMP primer sets with proper both ofLoop Forward (LF) primer and Loop Backward (LB) primer are selected and subjected to furtherscreening.First round of screening was done using WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix with cDNA ofwhich corresponding RNA concentration is 8.3 x 104 copies/reaction. Nine out of 16 primer sets wereselected by threshold time from the results of 40 minutes incubation at 65\u2103 and subjected to furtherscreening.Second round of screening was done using Bst3.0. The same amount of cDNA as the first round ofscreening is used. Two primer sets that showed relatively early non-specific amplification are discardedand remaining seven primer sets are subjected to further screening.Third and fourth rounds of screening were done by checking sensitivity to dilutions of cDNA and RNA,respectively. Five out of seven primer sets showed specific amplification for at least one replicate ofduplicate with cDNA concentration corresponding to 1.7 x 101 copies of input RNA (Supplementarysensitivity that showed specific amplification at 10-6 dilution of RNA (Figure 1). We also added twoprimer sets, one targeting S and the other targeting N, for reaction optimization experiments as theyshowed fast threshold time for cDNA and to keep ranges of target genes. Primer sequences arerepresented in Table 1.To optimize RT-LAMP reaction with Bst3.0, we first evaluated optimal concentration of dNTPand Mg2+ for each primer set. Three dNTP- Mg2+ concentration combinations are tested at 69\u2103: dNTP1.4 mM and Mg2+ 8 mM, dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM, dNTP 1 mM and Mg2+ 6 mM. The copy numberof RNA template was 1,000 copies per reaction. Best concentration combination was selected for eachprimer set by whether both of duplicate show specific amplification and by threshold time. Averagethreshold time (Tt_av) and corresponding dNTP and Mg2+ concentrations are as follows: dNTP 1 mMand Mg2+ 6 mM for \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d (Tt_av = 11.93), dNTP 1.4 mM and Mg2+ 8 mM for \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d (Tt_av= 7.74), dNTP 1.4mM and Mg2+ 6mM for \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d (Tt_av = 11.08 and 5.50, respectively).Next, we checked if amplification is improved at lower temperature (65\u2103) because optimalreaction temperature of SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase is 50-55\u2103 and manufacturerrecommend 65-72\u2103 for optimal performance of Bst3.0. Notably, \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d primersets show improved threshold time (Tt_av = 8.92 and 8.49, respectively).The Limit of Detection (LoD) of optimized RT-LAMP assays were assessed through 5 to 1000RNA copies/reaction in triplicate. Among four primer sets subjected to reaction optimization, \u201cS_1-2-2\u201dand \u201cN_21\u201d sets showed relatively poor sensitivity. For \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d primer sets, weadditionally evaluated LoD with 2-fold SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (20U/reaction). LoD andTt_av were improved by increasing reverse transcriptase amount. (Table 2, Supplementary Figure 2)As a result, both \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d and \u201cNsp3_2-24\u201d RT-LAMP assays could detect as low RNAconcentration as 100 copies per reaction.The cross-reactivity of two SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP assays targeting Nsp3 to other humanCoronaviruses was not found for hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV (Figure 2).In this study, we designed and screened LAMP primer sets targeting SARS-CoV-2. Reactionoptimization was also performed for selected primer sets. In summary, we designed and evaluated apair of RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 with limit of detection of 100 copies per reaction.Our RT-LAMP assays showed specificity to SARS-CoV-2 versus alphacoronavirus (hCoV-229E),betacoronavirus (hCoV-OC43) and MERS-CoV. Although we could not test specificity to SARS-CoVbecause proper sample was not in our hand, specificity of the RT-LAMP assays are easily expectablefrom the mismatching bases in primer binding sites (Figure 1). Especially, both of F1/B1 sites of\u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d primer set is in SARS-CoV-2 specific region of which aligning SARS-CoV sequence is notexist.About the sensitivity of LAMP assays, note that average threshold time is not well correlatedwith limit of detection. In fact, average threshold time of \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201d primer sets for 1000copies were faster than that of \u201cNsp3_1-61\u201d: 7.33 (RPR: 2/3) and 5.06 (RPR: 1/3) minutes, respectively.This dis-relation is previously reported [24].One peculiar observation is that both \u201cS_1-2-2\u201d and \u201cN_21\u201dshowed good sensitivity to cDNA template (Supplementary Figure 1) unlike to RNA. Observeddifference of sensitivity to RNA and cDNA seems significant even we account slight amplification thatmight happened during reverse transcription. The reason may include stochastic nature of formingproper LAMP amplification intermediate - \u201cdumbbell\u201d structure [24], higher stability of DNA:RNA doublestrand than DNA:DNA double strand and more.The limit of detection of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study, 100 copies per reaction,may not enough for sensitive screening of suspicious patients. This relatively high limit of detectionwould be from the target sequences used for primer design that are selected by specificity versusSARS-CoV. Indeed, target GC percentage and Tm of primers had to be adjusted to get enough numberof starting sets for primer screening during LAMP primer design to give less-optimal primer sets.Therefore, there might be better target sequences for LAMP assay of SARS-CoV-2 in the view point ofsensitivity. However, expected high specificity of RT-LAMP assays suggested in this study would be agood feature for a confirmatory test. In addition, considering high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 at earlystage after symptom onset [25], suggested RT-LAMP assays may still be usable for screening tests.In conclusion, we developed highly specific RT-LAMP assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2.The results of these RT-LAMP assays can be detected within 30 minutes after amplification reactionbegin. In addition, we provided optimized reaction conditions to which LCV colorimetric detectionmethod is applied that can be used for point-of-care tests.This work was supported by the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST)grant by the Ministry of Science and ICT (Grant No. CRC-16-01-KRICT).12.Nature, 2020.2020.WHO.China.
