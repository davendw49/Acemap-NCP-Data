Some worry it could badly hit the developing world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, potentially leading to a global human calamity. It is still early days, but using existing data we develop a large ensemble of ecological niche models that project monthly variation in climate suitability of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus throughout a typical climatological year. The current spread suggests a degree of climate determination with Coronavirus displaying preference for cool and dry conditions. The predecessor SARS-CoV was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic is improbable. More probable is the emergence of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks much like other respiratory diseases. People in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable. Those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability, while the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics. Our projections minimize uncertainties related with spread of SARS CoV-2, providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social, economic and political responses.", "text": "Biogeography studies the patterns and processes underlying the distribution ofLife on earth. One generalization emerging from hundreds of years of naturalhistory observations is that all organisms have a degree of environmentalspecialization. That is, while biomes in the planet have a range of different typesof organisms1, individual types of organisms cannot occur in every biome evenwhen, distant apart as they might be, they converge into playing the sameecological roles within ecosystems2. Biogeographers and ecologists alike resortto the concept of ecological niche3-5 to examine the relationship between thedistributions of organisms and other biotic or abiotic factors controlling them.An organism is said to be within its ecological niche if death rates of theorganism are lower that birth rates6,7. That is, an organism cannot persistbeyond its ecological niche, in a sink, unless there is a regular influx ofindividuals from source populations. Even if organisms are regularly reaching asink area, as one might expect with an easily dispersed pathogen, the spread andestablishment of the organism will be limited by ecological constraints. Althoughbiogeographic concepts, such as the species ecological niches, are commonlyused and applied to multicellular organisms (eukaryotes), there is an increasednumber of studies utilizing the ecological niche concepts and associatedanalytical tools to investigate relationships between the distributions ofunicellular organisms (prokaryotic), or viruses, and a range of environmentalfactors8.Building on the concept of ecological niche, we develop projections of monthlychanges in the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus outbreaks. Projections areobtained from an ensemble of 10 familiar machine learning and statisticalecological niche models9, each with 20 copies generated with bootstrapping toaccount for and enable the quantification of intra-model variability to the initialconditions10,11. Models were trained using the distribution of all recordedSARSCoV-2 Coronavirus cases by the 10/03/2020 with data compiled and madeavailable to the John Hopkins University Mapping 2019-nCoV portal12. Regionswith fewer than 5 positive cases were not included in the models. Exclusion ofsuch sites was based on the working assumption that sites with small numbersof positive cases are likely imported from infected regions, thus failing to provideevidence that the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus is being transmitted locally within itsecological niche. Predictors were temperature and precipitation values expectedbetween January and March using 1979\u20132013 as reference, and with datadownloaded from the high-resolution climatology database for the earth\u2019s landsurface13. Models were then projected monthly for the rest of the year.Analysis of all positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus plotted against monthlytemperature and precipitation values reveals that the interquartile range ofaverage environmental temperatures associated with positive cases so far isbetween -4,01\u00baC to 15,58\u00baC (99% range) and -2,04\u00baC to 9,49\u00baC (95% range). Forprecipitation, the interquartile range ranges from 4,68 mm to 116,06 mm (99%range) and 19,75 mm to 94,43 mm (95% range). These values are estimatedtaking into account total numbers of positive cases, which are obviously stronglydetermined by contingent factors linked with the origin of the SARS-CoV-2Coronavirus outbreak (the city of Wuhan in China) and subsequent pattern ofspread. While the pattern of spread is, as it seems based on our analysis,constrained by climate, the actual numbers of positive cases are affected bynonclimatic factors14, some of which might be stochastic. Less sensitivemeasurements can be obtained by using presence absence of positive cases. Withsuch an approach, the estimated interquartile ranges for temperature is -18,10\u00baCto 28,64\u00baC (99% range) and -8,81\u00baC to 25,65\u00baC (95% range). For precipitation itis 1,00 mm to 345,55 mm range (99% range) and 2,16 mm to 151,31 mm (95%range). Regardless of the approach used to quantify the climate envelope of theSARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, we are not characterizing the exact local temperatureand precipitation conditions constraining the virus spread but ratherdetermining the type of macro-climate conditions in the places where spreadingis occurring. Nevertheless, regardless of whether we calculate environmentalpreferences of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus using the total numbers ofincidences or their presence and absence, it appears the virus favors cool anddry conditions being largely absent under extremely cold and very hot and wetconditions (Figure 1).We summarized projections by ensembles of ecological niche models by climatezones15. The analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 strives in warm temperateclimates between October to May and cold temperate climates between April andSeptember (Figure 2). Arid environments follow the temperate warm trend ofseasonal probability of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus but withgenerally more moderate levels. Much of the tropics have low levels of climatesuitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus owing to their hightemperatures and precipitation (used here as a surrogate for humidity), followedby polar climates, where conditions of extreme cold temperatures seem to bebeyond the virus critical minimum tolerance values. In most of such low climatesuitability areas, human populations will likely be spared from outbreaks arisingfrom local transmissions (Figure 2).The analysis of risk provided at the climate zone level (Figure 2), masks thesharp seasonality and the fine-grained regional variation in risk that emergeswhen analyzing the patterns in geographical space (Figure 3). From June toSeptember, much of higher latitude regions of the southern hemisphere, likeArgentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, and Southern Africa will likelybe become exposed to new outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Models also project highestlatitude regions of the northern hemisphere to be badly hit by the Coronavirusduring this period, including Canada and Russia, but also the Scandinaviancountries. High elevation areas in the Andes and the Himalayas share the sameprospects. Concurrently, areas that, as we speak, are of extreme concern in thenorthern hemisphere (chiefly Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, and USA) shouldwitness a reduction in the incidence of new positive cases SARS-CoV-2Coronavirus. Beyond September and until the end of May, conditions will besuitable for renewed outbreaks in much of warmer temperate regions of Asia,Europe and North America.Not all viruses are climate determined. HIV/AIDS, for example, is not affected byexternal environmental factors. The virus is transmitted by sexual intercourse,blood transfusions, or from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery orbreastfeeding, so it never leaves the host\u2019s internal environmental conditions. Incontrast, SARS-CoV-2, like other respiratory viruses, namely its predecessorSARS-CoV, involves aerial transmissions of respiratory droplets or fomites,exposing the virus to external environmental conditions.SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus has already set foot in most parts of the world, butvirulent outbreaks with large numbers of local infections are still not global.Instead, outbreaks concentrate in the northern hemisphere, chiefly Asia, theMiddle East, Central, Southern and Western Europe, and the USA. Our modelssupport the view that the incidence of the virus will follow a seasonal patternwith outbreaks being favored by cool and dry weather, while being slowed downby extreme conditions of cold and heat as well as moist. Prevalence ofrespiratory disease outbreaks, such as influenza, during wintering conditions iscommon16,17. But the similarity of climate determination of SARS-CoV-2 with itspredecessor SARS-CoV is noteworthy given hope that fundamental traits sharedby the two Coronavirus might be conserved.Analyses of SARS-CoV outbreaks in relation to meteorology reveal significantcorrelations between the incidence of positive cases and aspects of weather. Forexample, an initial investigation linking SARS outbreaks and temperature inHong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan18, revealed significant correlationsbetween SARS-CoV incidences and temperature seven days (the known period ofincubation of SARS-CoV) before the outbreak, with environmental temperaturesassociated with positive cases of SARS-CoV ranging between 16\u00baC to 28\u00baC. Theyalso found that incidence of the Coronavirus was inversely related to humidity.Another study conducted between 11 March and 22 May 2003 in Hong Kong19showed that SARS-CoV incidences sharply decreased as temperature increasedfrom 15\u00baC to 29\u00baC, after which it practically disappeared. In this study,incidences under the cooler end of the gradient were 18-fold higher than underthe opposite warmer end of the gradient.The mechanism underlying these patterns climate determination is likely linkedwith the ability of the virus to survive external environmental conditions prior toreaching a host. For example, a recent study examined survival of driedSARSCoV Coronavirus on smooth surfaces and found that it would be viable for over 5days at temperatures ranging between 11-25\u00baC and relative humidity of 40-50%,drastically loosing viability as temperatures and humidity increased20. Heatintolerance of the Corona viruses is probably related to their being covered by alipid bilayer21,22, which could breakdown easily as temperatures increase.Humidity in the air is also expected to affect the transmissibility of respiratoryviruses. Once the pathogens have been expelled from the respiratory tract bysneezing, they literally float in the air and they do so for a longer period whenthe humidity is greater.More detailed examination of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak relationships with weatherevents will only be possible once the spread of the virus has stabilized. Thecurrent macroecological-level analysis enables inferences that would otherwisenot be possible with high-resolution data for specific case studies. That is,substitute the familiar analysis of meteorological variation at site levels matchedwith specific SARS-CoV-2 cases by examination of all known positive casesworldwide against an analysis of large-scale climatological variation. It is,obviously, possible that, as the virus spreads and additional climate regionswitness outbreaks of positive cases, inferences made herein are altered. We areskeptical this will happen for two reasons. Firstly, there is little reason to suspectthat out-of-China contaminations would have occurred only, or mainly, withtrade partners in the northern hemisphere14. China is a big world player, havingkey commercial partnerships with Africa and Latin America. Yet there is notindication that meaningful local infections have taken place in these areasdespite the global reporting of Coronavirus cases generally attributed totravellers coming from infected regions. Secondly, the climatic discrimination ofthe outbreaks is such that is seems unlikely to be a consequence of randomchance, trade preferences with China, or just the outcome of poorly developedpublic policies. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, although being stillexpanding, seems to have followed closely the expected (given what we know ofSARS-CoV) pattern of climate suitability. This suggests the Coronavirus mighthave reached equilibriumwith climate23,24, which, if true, would havecontributed to significantly reduce the unaccounted for data biases anduncertainties entering our ecological niche models25.Understanding the underlying factors involved in the successful spread ofSARSCoV-2 Coronavirus is critical to manage the timing and scale of the social,economic, and political reactions to it. While the Coronavirus is likely to spreadmuch more widely than at present, owing to the seasonal changes of climatesuitability, it is unlikely to do so with the same intensity, simultaneously. Ourresults will allow anticipate the timing and the magnitude of the likely publicinterventions to mitigate the adverse consequences of the Coronavirus on publichealth. Only with adequate planning will unnecessary collateral damages beimposed on individuals and the global economy.1011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738Hastie, T. & Tibshirani, R.

The data wasdownloaded on 08/03/2020.We downloaded temperature (mean, maximum, minimum) and precipitation(accumulated) from CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth\u2019sland surface areas; http://chelsa-climate.org)13. This is a high-resolution (30 arcsec) climate data set for the earth land surface hosted by the Swiss FederalInstitute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL. It provides monthlysummaries covering the period starting in January 1979 until December 2013.The time series data were then aggregated monthly though averaging so toprovide expected values for a typical climatological month in the recent past.The spatial distribution of incidence SAR-CoV-2 Coronavirus records were linkedto the corresponding monthly climate data. We used SDM-R platform9 forensemble ecological niche modeling10 (or species distributions modeling25), tocharacterize climate conditions associated with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2between January and March 2020. We used 10 commonly used machine learningmethods including generalized linear model (GLM)26, generalized additive model(GAM)27, classification and regression trees (CART)28, boosted regression trees(BRT)29, random forests (RF)30, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA)31, supportvector machine (SVM)32, multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP)33,maximum entropy (Maxent)34, and multivariate adaptive regression splines(MARS)35. We used a bootstrapping resampling procedure36, with 20replications, to generate the training and test datasets. We then fitted theecological niche models for each replication using the training dataset andevaluated them for their performance using the test dataset. We used the areaunder curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot and the trueskill statistic (TSS) to measure the predictive performance of models37. A ROCcurve plots sensitivity values (true positive fraction) on the y-axis against \u20181 \u2013specificity\u2019 values (false positive fraction) for all thresholds on the x-axis. AUC isa threshold-independent metric that varies from 0 to 1 and provides a singlemeasure of model performance. AUC values under 0.5 indicate discriminationworse than chance; a score of 0.5 implies random predictive discrimination; anda score of 1 indicates perfect discrimination. TSS is calculated as \u201csensitivity +specificity -1\u201d and ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates perfect agreement, avalue of 0 implies agreement expected by chance, and a value of less than 0indicates agreement worse than chance. We then used the ensemble of 200models to calculate and project a consensus distribution of spreading risk foreach month across the globe. Consensus was achieved through AUC-weightedmean across all models38.The authors thank and congratulate the John Hopkins University for real-timecompilation and release of incidence data for SAR-CoV-2 Coronavirus, withoutwhich this investigation would not have been possible.MBA conceived the study and wrote the manuscript.
