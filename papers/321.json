Althoughthis risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolvedimmediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not beestablished. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of2019-nCoV pneumonia.Methods: Literatures have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Webof Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8,2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias wasanalyzed by Egger\u2019s test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used toobtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographicregion and research scale.Results: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the meanage was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms asfollows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133)and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) ofpatients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In theterms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling orground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. Thepooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126).Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to furtherelaborate the clinical characteristics of NCIP, which is beneficial to the next step ofprevention and treatment.Since Dec 8, 2019, several cases of unknown pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan, Hubeiprovince, China. On January 3, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus was identified in samples ofbronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in Wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of theNCIP1. This coronavirus (CoV) was named \u2018\u20182019 novel coronavirus\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u20182019-nCoV\u2019\u2019 bythe World Health Organization (WHO)2. Six kinds of human coronaviruses have beenpreviously identified3. These include HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, which belong to theAlphacoronavirus genus; and HCoV-OC43, HCoVHKU1, severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),which belong to the Betacoronavirus genus4. Furthermore, coronaviruses have becomeassociated with deadly respiratory infections in humans following the emergence ofSARS-CoV in Guangdong, China during 2002, which affected 8098 people in 37 countries5.There then followed the MERS-CoV outbreak6. Early in the 2019n-CoV outbreak, it hasbecome clear that the virus can be transmitted from human-to-human7. A total of 28129 NCIPcases in the world have been confirmed, including 12 patients in the United States. Accordingto the government report by the mayor of Wuhan, at a press conference on 26th January 2020,approximately five million residents left Wuhan for other provinces within China andthousands of people left Wuhan for other countries before the lockdown7. Therefore, all overthe world will meet this public health issues probably.Until 8th/Feb/2019, ,76 literatures have been reported regarding the epidemiology and clinicalfeatures of pneumonia caused by 2019\u00acnCoV. After we reviewed all these literature researchby the clinical studies, various clinical symptoms have been proposed as the typical featuresfor the 2019nCoV, furthermore, some features are controversial in different clinicenvironments. Therefore, evidence-based medical clinical characters are required urgently. Inthis study, we did a systemic review and a single meta-analysis of the clinical features ofThis review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewsand Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses8.Keywords and study eligibility criteria were determined. The protocol for the review wasregistered with PROSPERO (Provisional registration number: 168532)PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International (http://www.greynet.org/), and TheCochrane Library were searched for articles published until February 6 2020. Articles on2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, such as 2019nCoV, NCIP, and Wuhan pneumonia werealso manually retrieved. To maximize search sensitivity, no filters or limits on language wereapplied (the retrieval process is shown in Figure 1).Selection CriteriaThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies reporting information regarding NCIP; (2)those that were clinical studies or consecutive cases; (3) availability of clinical data can bedrawn from the articles; (4) containing more than three cases. The exclusion criteria were asfollows: (1) repeat articles, letters, editorials, and expert opinions; (2) studies without usabledata; and (3) the articles published in languages other than English and Chinese.Two investigators (K.Q & Y.D) independently extracted data from eligible studies;disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third investigator. For each study, thefollowing information was recorded: necessary information (e.g., first author, year ofpublication), research characteristics (e.g., RCT, case report, retrospective study, course oftreatment), and study subject characteristics (e.g., gender, age, CT imagines, symptoms,therapies, and the incidence of complications).The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality9. Assessment scores of 0-3, 4-6, and7-9 indicated poor, fair, and good studies, respectively. Discrepancies were resolved byconsensus.Since approximate ten studies were included in each approach group, funnel plots were usedto detect publication bias. Publication bias was analyzed using Egger\u2019s linear regression test,which measures funnel plot asymmetry.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis (Version 2). Theresults are expressed as incidences and 95% CIs. A random-effects model was used toperform the statistical analyses, and a chi-squared test and I2 statistic were used to assess theinter-study heterogeneity. I2>50% indicated that heterogeneitywas not statisticallysignificant10. In order to further explore the sources of heterogeneity and examine whether theresults differed by study characteristics, subgroup analysis was performed according togeographic region (Wuhan area and outside Wuhan area), research scale (\uff1c50 cases and \u226550cases)10.We initially retrieved 145 articles of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, 9 of which met thecriteria for inclusion in our series. Reasons for exclusion included duplicate reports (n = 58),without clinical characteristics (n = 42), and other types of studies such as comments andletters to the editor (n = 36) (Figure 1).The methodological quality of the retained studies was high for observational studies (overallsatisfactory quality of evidence; table 1). Among eligible literatures, three studies includedindividual patient data of 15 patients (table 2). Another six articles included 341 patients,however, there were no individual patient data. Among all of these studies, seven studies(90%) were from the Wuhan area; two studies which included one patient was from theoutside of the Wuhan area. Study size ranged from 3 to 138 subjects, seven studies involvingless than 50 cases and two studies involving more than 50 cases.There were 10 symptoms of NCIP which were reported. The pooled incidence rate wascalculated for four symptoms: rhinorrhea (4.1%, 95% CI: 0.021-0.077), diarrhea (9.2%, 95%CI: 0.062-0.133), pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), and headache (8.9%, 95% CI:0.063-0.125). Interestingly, four patients were found without any symptoms although theywere diagnosed by RT-PCR11. The pooled incidence rate of no obvious symptoms patientswas 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) for all studies. There was no significant heterogeneity(I2=47.67%, P=0.054) (Table 3). There was also no indication of publication bias as suggestedby Egger\u2019s test (P = 0.12). Among been reported clinical symptoms, evidence ofheterogeneity was present in the symptoms of fever (I2 = 78.39%, P = 0.000), cough (I2 =64.76%, P = 0.004) expectoration (I2 = 83.23%, P = 0.000) anhelation (I2 = 69.21%, P = 0.001),muscle pain (I2 = 74.9%, P = 0.000) and fatigue (I2 = 90.8%, P = 0.000). We found noidentifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis. The results of subgroupanalyses according to geographic region and study scale are presented in Table 4.WBCWhite blood cells were below the normal range in 39 patients (the pooled incidence rate was12.4%, I2=33.97, P=0.146) and above the normal range in 71 patients (the pooled incidencerate was 20.7%, I2=0.000, P=0.466) (table 3). Lymphocytes were below the normal range in133 patients, the pooled incidence of increasing neutrophils was 37.7% (95% CI: 0.325-0.431)(Table 3). 93 patients had neutrophils above the normal range, evidence of heterogeneity andpublication bias was present in it (I2 = 83.47%, P = 0.01, egger\u2019s test P=0.012). We found noidentifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis (Table 4).The CT imagines of NCIP patients were reported differently. By reviewing the literature,there are three common manifestations as follows: (1) bilateral mottling or ground-glassopacity, (2) unilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, (3) crazy-paving pattern. Among thesestudies. 307 patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 40 patients showedbilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, and 9 patients with crazy-paving pattern (8.6%, 95%CI: 0.048-0.148). Additionally, Chen et. al. reported that pneumothorax occurred in onepatient12. Evidence of heterogeneity was present in the bilateral mottling or ground-glassopacity (I2 = 66.88%, P = 0.002), and unilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity (I2 = 71.1%, P= 0.001). We found no identifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis;Furthermore, there were nine patients with normal CT presentations during the period ofNCIP. The pooled incidence rate of this normal CT imagint was 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197),significant heterogeneity was presented (I2 = 67.16%, P = 0.002). In subgroup analysis,heterogeneity was decreased, indicated that the heterogeneity may come from the geographicregion (I2 = 14.62%, P = 0.279) and study scale (I2 = 47.05%, P = 0.079) (Table 4, FigureNearly all the patients accepted oxygen therapy. Among these studies, there were 268 patientswho used nasal cannula for 2-25 days, the pooled incidence was 74.4% (95% CI: 0.696-0.788)for all studies. 22.8% (95% CI: 0.186-0.275) patients used mechanical ventilation to assistventilation, the inhaled oxygen concentration was 35-100%. Moreover, 12 patients weretreated with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), the pooled incidence was 4.6%(95% CI: 0.027-0.077). (Table 2). There was no evidence of heterogeneity and publicationbias. The results of subgroup analysis according to geographic region and study scale arepresented in Table 3.Unfortunately, 26 died cases were reported, the pooled incidence of mortality was 78.1% (95%CI: 0.062-0.126), there was no significant heterogeneity (I2=39.64%, P=0.569). Since thecourse of treatment of NCIP is about three weeks until some articles published, some patientsstill accepted therapy in the hospital, the statistics on mortality may be inaccurate (Table 2).There was significant heterogeneity in the ARDS group (I2 = 60.76%, P = 0.01). We found noidentifiable sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analysis (Table 3).In our research, the number of male patients more than female patients (62.1% vs 37.9%).This result is consistent with the gender distribution of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV13,14.Meanwhile, Chen et.al also showed 2019-nCoV infection is more likely to affect males12. Thereduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the protection fromX chromosome and s sex-specific effects in infectious disease susceptibility15. On the contrary,a recent report that showed there was no difference in the proportion of men and womenbetween ICU patients and non-ICU patients16. Although the mechanism of this differencecannot be explained at present, male patients should be paid more attention.A recent study showed that nCoV was detected in stool samples of patients with abdominalsymptoms 17. In our research, the pooled incidences rate of diarrhea was 7.8%, this resultslower than the reported results of about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoVinfection18. Although the cause of this phenomenon is unclear, it suggests that we need to payattention to patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and contact isolation should be taken. Inaddition,symptoms.Four patients (5.7%) who with obvious symptoms were diagnosed by RT-PCR. Such patientswill become a challenge in the future epidemic prevention process, which requires us to havedetailed screening strategies, and we should be more vigilant in patients without obviousIn terms of laboratory tests, the pooled incidence rate of lymphocytes reduce was 47.9%. Onthe other hand, the pooled incidence rate of increasing Neutrophils was 44.6%. Theseabnormalities are similar to those previously observed in patients with MERS-CoV andSARS-CoV infection19. These conclusions further confirm that lymphopenia along withneutrophilia was a feature of SARS-Cov, and 2019-nCoV might mainly act on lymphocytes,especially T lymphocytes20. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infectother cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, andcause changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes12. Inaddition, lymphopenia can be caused by glucocorticoids, and thus any debilitating conditionhas thepotential to induce lymphopeniavia stressmechanisminvolving thehypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Therefore, treatment with glucocorticoids complicatedthe issue regarding lymphopenia21.Nine (11.5%) patients were diagnosed with NCIP, although the CT imaging was normal. Thisresult reveals that the CT examination lacks complete sensitivity and cannot alone reliablyfully exclude this disease, particularly early in the infection. Therefore, it is necessary tocombine the CT examination with RT-PCR to make a definite diagnosis. Besides, Groundglass opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and consolidations were consistent HRCTmanifestations in both metapneumovirus infection and SARS, the presence of crazy pavingpattern is more suggestive of SARS22. Although the pooled incidence of crazy paving pattern(defined as thickened interlobular septa and intralobular lineswith superimposedground-glass opacification) was 8.4%, it is very important imagining for NCIP.Until now, conclusions on the mortality of NCIP are inconsistent. The early two researchesinclude 138 cases and 41 cases, the mortality was 4.3% and 15% respectively2,16.Nevertheless, compared with more than 10% mortality of SARS-CoV and 35% mortality ofMERS-CoV23, 2019-nCoV has a lower case mortality. In our research, the pooled incidencemortality was 8.9% respectively. Although this conclusion is basically consistent withprevious reports2,12, this result higher than the mortality reported by the Chinese government(2.44%). The reason for this phenomenon is attributed to two aspects. First of all, thesingle-arm meta-analysis is inherently less stable than the two-arm meta-analysis, but this isunavoidable due to no enough clinical data. Secondly, there were not enough diagnosismethods and treatment experiences about NCIP at the beginning of the outbreak. With theimprovement of recognitions of NCIP and the clinical application of antiviral drugs such asRemdesivir17, the mortality will be further reduced.A number of limitations need to be acknowledged. The limitations include those the numberof included studies is small, thus limiting to the detection of the publication bias and leadingto uncertainty of practical relevance of our meta-analysis. In addition, the clinicalcharacteristics are related to many factors, such as basic physical condition, disease progress,examination and treatment conditions, etc. However, we were not able to conduct furthersubgroup analysis based on the abovementioned factor because most of the included studiesdid not separate the participants into different groups for outcome measurements. Third,significant heterogeneity remains a critical concern in this meta-analysis. To solve thisproblem, we used random-effects in meta-analysis and subgroup analysis was performed inthis study24. Besides, we did not calculate the pooled incidence rate unless the source wasidentified by subgroup analysis. significant heterogeneity or a public basis10. Last but not least,the single-arm meta-analysis without a control group, causality is difficult to determine fromthe cases alone. However, all over the world, the onset of reactivation was relatively short andconsistent. The strengths of this work include our ability to detect a serious question that wasnot observed during the clinical development program for NCIP.In conclusion, the results of this single-arm meta-analysis and systemic review give us aquantitative pooled incidence rate of clinical characteristics of NCIP. It is clear that all theseclinical characteristics has great potential to improve diagnosis and patient\u2019s stratification inNCIP. It may also have a clinical impact as clinic features is routinely used in clinical practice,providing an unprecedented opportunity to improve decision support in NCIP for diagnosis ortreatment at fast and low cost. The findings suggest that although most NICP patients havesymptoms or abnormal CT imaging presentations, a few patients without any symptom or anyabnormal CT imaging. Therefore, a prescriptive diagnosis process and the vigilance for NCIPis necessary. Besides, the digestive symptoms should be concerned, especially for the patientswith the contact history of NICP. However, at the beginning of the epidemic, a lack of clinicalresearch might influence the results of the meta-analysis. Further multivariate studies arewarranted to corroborate the findings of this meta-analysis.We thank the patients, the nurses and clinical staff who are providing care for the patient, andall the people who fight with NCIP.2019.
