To date, there were 78630 cases reported in China and 3664 casesconfirmed in 46 foreign countries (World Health Organization, 2020). Recently, Iranhas become an epicenter in the Middle East region, which has the largest cumulativenumber of deaths outside China (Wikipedia, 2020). As of 1 March 2020, Iran hasconfirmed 987 COVID-19 cases and including 54 associated deaths (Wikipedia,2020). At least six neighboring countries (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Afghanistanand Pakistan) have reported imported COVID-19 cases from Iran. Given the seriousconcerns over the under-ascertainment of COVID-19 cases in Iran (ABC News, 2020),UAE and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries have suspended inbound andunder-ascertainment.In this study, we used the imported cases and air travel data from Iran to other MiddleEast countries to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Iran. Then we comparedour estimates with the number of reported cases in Iran to evaluate the extent ofWe obtained transport capability of international airlines from 30 major airports inplatform (https://data.variflight.com/). We collected the number of exported casesfrom Iran to other countries in the Middle East (World Health Organization, 2020).Population size of Iran (81,800,269 in 2018) was obtained from the World Bank(https://data.worldbank.org/). Table 1 shows the number of daily population flow andtotal reported cases of countries used in our calculation.Following Imai et al.\u2019s (2020), we assumed number of cases (n) exported from Iranfollows a Binomial distribution (Bin) with size N and probability p. Here, Nrepresents total number of cases infected in Iran, and p is the probability that one caseis detected overseas. We approximated p by the ratio of daily outbound passengers ofIran (D) over total size of population (M) that those airports serve and multiplying themean duration (t) from exposure to detection. Thus, p = Dt / M. We set t at 10 daysaccording to (Imai et al., 2020). We assumed that the catchment population is the totalpopulation of Iran. We calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the totalnumber of COVID-19 cases in Iran (\u03bb) by fitting model to the number of confirmedcases with Binomial-distributed likelihood framework. As shown in Eqn (1), \u00b7represents the total log-likelihood and k is the total number of countries we selected.The 95% confidence intervals (CI) are calculated by using the profile likelihoodestimation approach determined by a Chi-square quantile.log\u2211log, ;.(1)To explore more alternative scenarios, we also considered a smaller catchmentpopulation (60,000,000) and a shorter detection window (8 days). We considered abaseline scenario with 100% attendance rate for each aircraft as well as otheralternative scenarios. In addition, we tested the situation that 90% and 70%attendance rate for each aircraft, keeping other situation as baseline scenario.We estimated the total number of cases in Iran was 16533 (95% CI: 5925, 35538) by25 February 2020. Table 2 summarizes the sensitivity analysis of varying the baselineassumptions and alternative scenarios about catchment population, detection windowand attendance rates.        As suggested by Zhao et al. (2020), underreporting was likely occurred at the earlystage of the COVID-19 outbreak, due to the shortage of diagnostic kits andinadequate screening for suspected cases (Imai et al., 2020). Recent study by Tuite etal. (2020) estimated a total of 18,300 (95% CI: 3770-53,470) cases in Iran by 25February 2020. Our estimates are consistent with Tuite et al.\u2019s (2020) work. Toconclude, Iran\u2019s ascertainment rate could be at a level of 0.6% by Feb 25, 2020.
