Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novelcoronavirus\u2019s surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus,is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information onthe SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 \u00c5. We identified a set ofmonoclonal antibodieswith cross-reactivity tobetacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize withantibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. Wedetermined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadlyreactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the\u201cclosed\u201d prefusion S structure, but is accessible in \u201copen\u201d conformations. This first-ever resolution of ahuman antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to aconserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide aframework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 andrelated betacoronaviruses.High resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD).Recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by SARS-CoV antibodies.Structure of the SARS-COV-2 RBD in complex with antibody CR3022.Identification of a cryptic site of vulnerability on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike.The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 marks the seventh coronavirus to be isolated from humans, andthe third to cause a severe disease\u2014named COVID-19\u2014after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)(Munster et al., 2020). The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2,and the grave risk it poses to global health, prompted the World Health Organization to declare, on 30January 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern and on 11nearly 140000 SARS-CoV-2 infections and more than 5000 associated deaths reported across at least 100countries. The rapidly evolving epidemiology of the pandemic and absence of licensed prophylactics ortherapeutics for the disease have accelerated the need to elucidate the molecular biology of this novelcoronavirus.        Although SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus, it shares genetic and morphologic features withothers in the Coronaviridae family, particularly those from the Betacoronavirus genus. The genome of therecently isolated SARS-CoV-2 shares 82% nucleotide identity with human SARS-CoV and 89% with batSARS-like-CoVZXC21 (Lu et al., 2020). The spike (S) glycoprotein, in particular, bears significantstructural homology with SARS-CoV compared to other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV. LikeSARSCoV, the surface Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds the same host receptor, ACE-2, to mediatecell entry                Recently, the molecular structure of recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein wassolved in a stabilized pre-fusion state, by single particle cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM), at aresolution of 3.8 \u00c5(Wrapp et al., 2020). Despite the comprehensive structural characterization of the spikeprotein as a whole, movement of the RBD between \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d conformational states preventedcomplete modeling of the RBD domains. Subsequent cryo-EM investigations of SARS-CoV-2 providedmore detail of RBD, particularly at sites that contact the human ACE-2 receptor                The SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 313-532), with a C-terminal His-tag, was expressed in 293Fcells, and purified by NiNTA affinity, and size-exclusion chromatography. Crystallization conditionscreening identified 20% Jeffamine D2000, 10% Jeffamine M2005, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1M MES pH 5.5 fordiffraction quality crystal growth. Crystals diffracted to <1.8 \u00c5 in group P 41 21 2 and to a complete datasetto 1.95 \u00c5 that could be scaled and processed (Table 1). The structure was refined to an Rfree of 20% andRwork of 22% with no Ramachandran outliers. S residues 313-532 were clearly interpretable from theelectron density map, with a dual conformation of a loop containing residues 484 to 487 clearly visible inthe electron density map (Figure 1). Structure comparison of the unliganded RBD structure presented here,with the stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S-2P) molecule structure determined by Cryo-EM (PDBID: 6VSB) (Wrapp et al., 2020) shows high structural similarity, with an RMSD of 0.68, 0.68, and 0.71 foreach of the spike protomers. In the structure of the S-2P molecule (S-2P) (Wrapp et al., 2020) 25, 29 or 49amino acids (aa) within each protomer RBD are not modeled, including 40% of the ACE-2 receptor bindingsite as measured by buried surface area (BSA)        In an effort to identify antibodies that could bind to SARS-CoV-2, we screened a set ofSARSCoV,(Tripp et al., 2005) and MERS CoV(Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2015) RBD-reactive antibodiesfor binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We demonstrated that the SARS-CoV mouse antibody 240CD (Trippet al., 2005) had nanomolar (nM) affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and did not significantly blockACE2 receptor binding (Figure 2). CR3022\u2014a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody (Tian et al., 2020) identifiedfrom a human phage-display library (ter Meulen et al., 2006)\u2014also bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with nMaffinity (Figure 2B). We assessed competition binding between 240CD and CR3022, and show that theseantibodies cross-compete with each other for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Figure 2C, 2D).        SARS-CoV-2 has a likely zoonotic origin and horseshoe bats have been implicated as naturalreservoirs of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Menachery et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020). As such, wenext explored antibody cross-reactivity with the S glycoproteins of two bat SARS-related CoVs:SARSrCoV Rs4874        The antigenic cross-reactivity of this set of antibodies precipitated an investigation into theirmolecular recognition determinants. The potential relevance of a human antibody motivated theinvestigation to prioritize studies of CR3022, for which a sequence was available (ter Meulen et al., 2006).The CR3022 heavy chain is encoded by IGHV5-51*03, contains a 12-aa CDR H3 with 8 V gene-encodedresidues altered by somatic hypermutation. CR3022 light chain is encoded by IGKV4-1*01 with 1 Vgeneencoded residue, altered by somatic hypermutation, and a 9-aa CDR L3 (Extended Data Figure 2A). Toprovide an atomic-level understanding of the structure of the CR3022 antibody, we crystallized theantigenbinding fragment (Fab) of CR3022. Crystals diffracted to 3.2 \u00c5 resolution in space group P 21 (Table 1).Overall the structure of the CR3022 Fab revealed a relatively flat antigen-combining site, with the exceptionof an extended protruding 12-aa CDR L1 loop (Figure S2A).To determine the structure of CR3022 in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we carried outcrystallization conditions screening, with crystals of the CR3022-RBD complex forming in 1M Succinicacid, 0.1M Hepes pH 7, 2% PEG MME2000 and determined the crystal structure by X-ray diffraction to4.25 \u00c5 (Table 1). The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined CR3022and SARS-CoV-2 RBD structures as search models and was refined to an Rwork/Rfree of 0.242/0.292 (Table1). CR3022 bound to the RBD at an epitope centered on S glycoprotein residues 377-386 with a total buriedsurface area of 871 \u00c5 (Figure 3, Figure S2, and Table S1). This region is highly conserved betweenSARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S3). Comparison of the CR3022 epitope site with previously describedantibody-complex structures for SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV indicates that CR3022 describes a novelrecognition site (Figure 3 and Figs. S3, S4). Further sequence analysis of the epitope indicates that thisepitope is conserved in betacoronavirus clade 2b, with also some similarity in clade 2d (Fig. S3). To confirmthat this site was also shared with 240CD, we produced an RBD knockout mutant by introducing a glycansequon at position 384, and by biolayer interferometry show that both CR3022 and 240CD binding to theThe epitope conservation within the clade explains the antigenic cross-reactivity with both humanSARS-CoV and bat SARS related CoV. To date, there has been extensive structural characterization of theSARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV spike molecule and domains, which provides a framework for understandingthe novel SARS-CoV-2 spike molecule (Table S2). In the context of the coronavirus trimeric Sglycoproteins, the RBD displays two prototypical conformations either in an \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d position, withimplications for receptor binding and cell entry (Table S1). To further analyze these conformations, wemodeled the CR3022 binding to the trimeric structures of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. TheCR3022 epitope is occluded by adjacent spike protomers when the RBD is in the \u201cdown\u201d conformation,but becomes more accessible when the spike is in a more open conformation here multiple RBD moleculesare in the \u201cup\u201d conformation (Figure 4). There is still a clash of the antibody Fc1 region with the NTDfrom the same protomer, or an RBD from an adjacent protomer when modeled using the static structure.To understand whether CR3022 could bind to SARS-CoV S glycoproteins, we measured bindingto stabilized S-2P or non-stabilized versions of S (Figure 4). We observed robust binding to thenonstabilized S glycoprotein, while binding to SARS S-2P Trimer was low. We then treated the SARS S-2Ptrimer with trypsin and/or incubation with the ACE2 receptor to assess whether minimal proteolytic actionor receptor binding could increase the availability of the \u201ccryptic\u201d CR3022 epitope. Incubation of thestabilized S-2P trimer with human ACE2 did not dramatically affect CR3022 binding, while in contrast,the trypsin treatment of the S-2P protein resulted in increased binding akin to the unstabilized Sglycoprotein binding, and the level of binding was titratable, with increasing amounts of S-2P resulting inhigher CR3022 binding. Given the prior neutralization and protection studies utilizing CR3022, and itsability to complement potent neutralizing antibodies, it is likely that the CR3022 epitope represents a\u201ccryptic\u201d epitope that becomes exposed during the processes of viral cell entry.        In summary, our data represents the most detailed structural information for the SARS-CoV-2 RBDto date and the first structure of the SARS-CoV-2 in complex with a human antibody.

DNA encoding theSARS-Cov-2 RBD (residues 331-527) was synthesized (Genscript) with a C-terminal His6 purification tagand cloned into a CMVR plasmid, and protein was expressed by transient transfection in 293F cells for sixdays. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His protein was purified from cell culture supernatant using a Ni-NTA(Qiagen) affinity column. DNA encoding the S protein ectodomains (residues 1-1194) from batSARSrelated CoV isolates Rs4231 and Rs4874 (ref.(Hu et al., 2017)) were synthesized (Genscript) with aCterminal T4-Foldon domain or C-terminal GCN domain, respectively, followed by factor xA cleavage sitesand Strep-Tactin purification tags. Bat SARSr-CoV S genes were cloned into a modified pcDNA3.1expression plasmid        The sequences of the CR3022 variable regions of the heavy and light chains are available inGenBank under accession numbers DQ168569 and DQ168570, respectively (ter Meulen et al., 2006). Thesesequences were synthesized (Genscript) and cloned into CMVR expression vectors (NIH AIDS reagentprogram) between a murine Ig leader (GenBank DQ407610) and the constant regions of human IgG1(GenBank AAA02914), Ig\u03ba (GenBank AKL91145). Plasmids encoding heavy and light chains werecotransfected into Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After 5 days,antibodies were purified from cleared culture supernatants with Protein A agarose (ThermoFisher) usingstandard procedures, buffer exchanged into Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS), and quantified usingcalculated E and A280 measurements.The Fab fragment of antibody CR3022 was prepared by digestion of the full-length IgG usingenzyme Lys-C (Roche). The digestion reaction was allowed to proceed for 2.5 hours at 37\u00b0C. Digestionwas assessed by SDS-PAGE and upon completion, the reaction mixture was passed through protein-Gbeads (0.5-1 ml beads), 3 times and the final flow through was assessed by SDS-PAGE for purity. The Fabfragment was mixed with purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and the complex was allowed to form for 1 hour atroom temperature.TGCVIAWNSNNLDSKVGGNYNYLYRLFRKSNLKPFERDISTEIYQAGSTPCNGVEGFNCYFPLQSEVQLVQSGTEVKKPGESLKISCKGSGYGFITYWIGWVRQMPGKGLEWMGIIYPGDSETRYSPSFQDIVMTQSPDSLAVSLGERATINCKSSQSVLYSSINKNYLAWYQQKPGQPPKLLIYWASTRESGVPSARS-CoV-2 RBD at 10 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml in PBS buffer was screened for crystallization conditionsusing an Art Robbins Gryphon crystallization robot, 0.2 ul drops, and a set of 1200 crystallizationconditions. Crystal drops were observed using a Jan Scientific UVEX-PS with automated UV andbrightfield drop imaging robot. Crystals of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD grew after 24 hours in multipleconditions from the Molecular Dimensions MIDAS crystal screen, with diffraction-quality crystals seen inconditions B1, G1, F6, and H10. CR3022 Fab was screened for crystallization at 10.0 mg/ml and 5.0 mg/mlconcentrations in PBS. Diffraction quality crystals grew after 48 hours in 0.1M Imidazole pH 6.5, 40%2propanol and 15% PEG 8,000. For the complex, CR3022 Fab and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were mixed in 1:1molar ratio and crystallization drops were set-up at 8.0 and 4.0 mg/ml concentrations in PBS buffer asdescribed above. Crystals grew in a crystallization condition containing 1M Succinic acid, 0.1M HEPESpH 7.0 and 2% PEG MME2000. Both, RBD alone and CR3022 Fab-RBD complex, crystals were harvestedand cryo-cooled in their respective crystallization conditions plus 25% glycerol.Single crystals were transferred to mother liquor containing 22% glycerol, and cryo-cooled in liquidnitrogen prior to data collection. Diffraction data for SARS-CoV-2 RBD were collected at AdvancedPhoton Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, NE-CAT ID24-C beamline, and measured using aDectris Eiger 16M PIXEL detector. Crystals grown in MIDAS condition B1 (20% Jeffamine D2000, 10%Jeffamine M2005, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1M MES pH 5.5) provided the highest resolution diffraction with spotsvisible to 1.8 \u00c5. A complete dataset could be processed to 1.95 \u00c5 in space group P41212. CR3022 Fabcrystals diffracted to 3.3 \u00c5 on NE-CAT ID24-C beamline. Diffraction data could be scaled in P21 spacegroup with 99.9% completeness. Diffraction data for CR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex werecollected on NE-CAT ID24-C beamline at Advanced Photon Source (APS), and measured using a DectrisEiger 16M PIXEL detector. Diffraction data from multiple crystals were merged and scaled together toachieve a final resolution of 4.2 \u00c5 with overall completeness of 82.2%. Data collection statistics arereported in Table 1.Phenix xtriage was used to analyze the scaled diffraction data produced from HKL2000 and XDS. Datawas analyzed for completeness, Matthew\u2019s coefficient, twinning or pseudo-translational pathology. Thestructure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser and a searchmodel of the SARS RBD (PDB ID: 2AJF, molecule C). CR3022 Fab crystal structure was determined bymolecular replacement using Coxsackievirus A6 neutralizing antibody 1D5 (PDB ID: 5XS7) as a searchmodel. The CR3022-RBD complex structure was determined by molecular replacement using the refinedCR3022 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD structures as search models. Refinement was carried out using Phenixrefine with positional, global isotropic B factor refinement, and defined TLS groups, with iterative cyclesof manual model building using COOT. Structure quality was assessed with MolProbity. The finalrefinement statistics for all the structures are reported in Table 1. All structure figures were generated using        Epitope sites correspond to antigen sites that are in contact with the antibody in the antigen-antibodycomplex (i.e. all sites that have non-hydrogen atoms within 4 \u00c5 of the antibody). For a given epitope site,the weight, which characterizes the interaction between the epitope site and the antibody (improved basedon        (2 \u2329  \u232a+        )\u2329  \u232ain which, nc is the number of contacts with the antibody (i.e. the number of non-hydrogen antibody atomswithin 4 \u00c5 of the site) ; nnb is the number of neighboring antibody residues; \u2329  \u232a is the mean number ofcontacts nc and \u2329  \u232a is the mean number of neighboring antibody residues nnb across all epitope sites. Aweight of 1.0 is attributed to the average interaction across all epitope sites. Neighboring residue pairs wereidentified by Delaunay tetrahedralization of side-chain centers of residues (C\uf061 is counted as a side chainatom, pairs further than 8.5 \u00c5 were excluded). Quickhull        Affinity kinetic interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins and antibodies were monitored on anOctet RED96 instrument (Fort\u00e9Bio). After reference subtraction, binding kinetic constants weredetermined, from at least 4 concentrations of Fab, by fitting the curves to a 1:1 Langmuir binding modelusing the Data analysis software 9.0 (Fort\u00e9Bio). Antibodies were loaded at 30 ug/ml onto a AHC probe for120 s followed by baseline incubation for 30-60 s.To assess antibody competition, either 240CD or CR3022 or a non-specific control antibodyCR107 was incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD prior to assessment of binding to CR3022 or 240CD.Antibody concentration was 30 ug/ml. To assess binding of human ACE-2 receptor in the presence orabsence of antibodies CR3022, or 240CD, RBD was loaded onto a HIS probe. The RBD was thensequentially incubated with either CR3022, 240CD or control antibody CR1-07 prior to incubation withhuman ACE-2 receptor.CR3022 was loaded onto an AHC probe for 120s prior to incubation with SARS-CoV Sglycoproteins (15 ug/ml) alone or pre-incubated with ACE2 protein. SARS S-2P protein was treated with0.1% bovine pancreas trypsin for 10 minutes prior to binding to binding measurements. SARS Spike proteinwas provided by BEI resources, Lot 768P152.
