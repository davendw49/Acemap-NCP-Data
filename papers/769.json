Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\") assay method for simple, rapid, ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our method has a great potential for developing next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics.", "text": "        SARS-CoV-        Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method is the most commonly used technology for pathogennucleic acid detection and has been considered as a \u201cgold standard\u201d for disease diagnosticsdue to high sensitivity and specificity.4, 5, 6 However, it typically relies on expensive equipmentand well-trained personnel, all of which is not suitable for point of care diagnostic application.In recent decades, several isothermal amplification methods, such as recombinasepolymerase amplification (RPA)7, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)8, have beendeveloped as attractive alternatives to conventional PCR method because of their simplicity,rapidity and low cost. However, there is still a challenge to apply it to develop a reliable POCdiagnostics for clinical applications due to non-specific signals (e.g., false-positive).9, 10Recently, RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas nuclease-based nucleic acid detection has shown greatpromise for the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics technology due to itshigh sensitivity, specificity and reliability.11, 12 For example, some Cas nucleases (e.g., Cas12a,Cas12b and Cas13a) perform strong collateral cleavage activities in which acrRNA-targetbinding activated Cas can indiscriminately cleave surrounding non-target single-strandednucleic acids.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 By combining with RPA preamplification, Cas13 and Cas12a have,respectively, been used to develop SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic ReporterUnLOCKing) system18 and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter)system14 for highly sensitive nucleic acid detection. Apart from RPA method, someCRISPRCas-based nucleic acid sensors utilized the LAMP and PCR approaches, for instance, theCRISPR-Cas12b-assisted HOLMESv2 platform.16 However, these CRISPR-Cas-baseddetection methods typically require separate nucleic acid pre-amplification and multiplemanual operations, which undoubtedly complicates the procedures and brings aboutcontaminations.In this study, we reported an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\")assay for rapid, ultrasensitive, specific and visual detection of nucleic acid. Dual crRNAs areintroduced to initiate highly efficient CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection. In ourAIODCRISPR assay, all components for nucleic acid amplification and CRISPR detection arethoroughly mixed in a single, one-pot reaction system and incubated at a single temperature(e.g., 37 \u00b0C), eliminating the need for separate preamplification and amplified producttransferring. As application examples, the AIOD-CRISPR assay was engineered to detectsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)19 and humanimmunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).20 Since SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 are retrovirus, weevaluated the performance of our AIOD-CRISPR assay by detecting both of their DNA andRNA. Especially, the test results of our AIOD-CRISPR assay can be directly visualized bynaked eye. Therefore, we anticipate that the AIOD-CRISPR assay will facilitateCRISPRbased next-generation molecular diagnostics towards point-of-care applications.AIOD-CRISPR assay system. As shown in Figure 1A, the AIOD-CRISPR assay system useda pair of Cas12a-crRNA complexes generated by two individual crRNAs to bind twocorresponding sites which are close to the recognition sites of primers in the target sequence.The Cas12a-crRNA complexes were separately prepared prior to being loaded into thesolution containing two RPA primers, ssDNA-FQ reporters, recombinase, single-strandedDNA binding protein (SSB), strand-displacement DNA polymerase, and target sequences.When incubating the AIOD-CRISPR system in one pot at 37\u00b0C, RPA amplification is firstinitiated and exposes the binding sites of the Cas12a-crRNA complexes due to the stranddisplacement. Once the Cas12a-crRNA complexes bind the target sites, Cas12aendonuclease is activated and cleaves the nearby ssDNA-FQ reporters to producefluorescence. Similarly, RPA amplified products are also the substrates to undertake the sameprocess and continuously trigger CRISPR-Cas12a-based collateral cleavage activity.Previous study 14, 17 has demonstrated that this collateral cleavage activity is irrelevant to targetstrand cleavage in CRISPR-Cas12a system. Therefore, target sequences for theAIODCRISPR assay are not limited by the Cas12a\u2019s protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 21.To evaluate and develop our AIOD-CRISPR assay, we prepared and tested eight reactionsystems (Reactions # 1-8) with various components (Figure 1B (i)). The ssDNA-FQ reporterwas a 5 nt oligonucleotide (5'-TTATT-3') labelled by 5' 6-FAM (Fluorescein) fluorophore and3' Iowa Black\u00ae FQ quencher. After incubated at 37\u00b0C for 40 min, only reaction # 5 containingthe target sequence, dual crRNAs, Cas12a, and the RPA mix produced super-brightfluorescence signal, which could be directly visualized in a LED blue or UV light illuminator.Interestingly, even under ambient light environment without any excitation, a color changefrom orange-yellow to green was observed in the reaction tube # 5 by naked eyes.Furthermore, the assay products were verified by denaturing polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (PAGE). As shown in Figure 1B(ii), a strong band with shorter DNA size wasobserved only in the lane of the reaction # 5, which resulted from the cleaved ssDNA-FQreporter with bright fluorescence. On the contrary, for other reaction systems, only weak bandswith slightly longer DNA sizes were observed in their corresponding lanes due to fluorescencequench of the intact uncut ssDNA-FQ reporters. In addition, in real-time fluorescence detection,only the reaction # 5 showed an elevated fluorescence signals that saturated within 13 min(Figure 1B(iii)). Thus, these results show that our AIOD-CRISPR assay provides a simple,rapid, one-pot approach for target-specific nucleic acid detection.Since RPA amplification reaction is initiated after adding MgOAc,22 we are interested inknowing if the nucleic acid amplification was initiated at room temperature during samplepreparation in our AIOD-CRISPR assay system. We prepared two AIOD-CRISPR solutions(one positive and one negative) and allowed them to remain at room temperature for 10 min.As shown in Figure S1, no significant fluorescence change between positive and negativesamples was observed in the AIOD-CRISPR solutions at room temperature. On the contrary,there was an obvious fluorescence increasing after just one-min incubation at 37\u00b0C (FigureS1). The fluorescence signal was eventually saturated at 15 min after incubated at 37\u00b0C.Therefore, our AIOD-CRISPR assay system is mainly triggered only after reactiontemperature arrives at 37\u00b0C.Optimization of AIOD-CRISPR assay. Collateral cleavage of ssDNA-FQ reporter by theCas12a is triggered by the binding of crRNA to target sites.13, 14 Thus, we hypothesized thathigher binding opportunities could increase the collateral cleavage activity and eventuallyimprove the detection sensitivity for AIOD-CRISPR. To prove this, we introduced a pair ofcrRNAs to recognize the corresponding target sites. A pUCIDT-AMP plasmid containing 300bp HIV-1 p24 gene cDNA (p24 plasmid) was used as the target and three different designs forprimers and crRNAs were investigated (Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2B, AIOD-CRISPRwith dual crRNAs (crRNA1+crRNA2) shows similar fluorescence curve as that with crRNA2,but was much better than using crRNA1 in real-time detection. Doubling the amount of crRNA1or crRNA2 actually didn\u2019t benefit the detection efficiency. On detection sensitivity, Figure 2Cshows that AIOD-CRISPR with dual crRNAs was able to detect as low as 1.2 copies of thep24 plasmid templates within 40 min, while AIOD-CRISPR with single crRNA2 doesn\u2019t detectit. Thus, introducing dual crRNAs is beneficial to improve the sensitivity of AIOD-CRISPRassay.We further optimized ssDNA-FQ reporters in our the AIOD-CRISPR assay because thereporter concentration is crucial in fluorescence readout. As shown in Figure S2A, higherconcentration of ssDNA-FQ reporters was used, shorter time was taken to reach saturatedfluorescence intensity. As to threshold time and visual detection, the minimal concentration forsaturated values was 4 \u03bcM (Figure S2B-S2D). Collateral cleavage by activated Cas12a is anactivity of cutting nearby ssDNA-FQ reporters.13, 14 Thus, increasing ssDNA-FQ reporterconcentration can strengthen the fluorescence signals. In addition, primer concentration alsoaffected the AIOD-CRISPR\u2019s efficiency. As shown in Figure S3, the optimal concentrationshould be 0.32 \u03bcM. Together, introducing dual crRNAs and using high concentration ofssDNA-FQ reporters enable efficient AIOD-CRISPR with 0.32 \u03bcM of each primer.HIV-1 detection by AIOD-CRISPR assay. To investigate its sensitivity for HIV-1 DNAdetection, we first applied the optimized AIOD-CRISPR assay to detect various copies ofHIV1 p24 plasmid templates (from 1.2\u00d7 100 to 1.2\u00d7 105 copies). As shown in Figure 3A, theAIODCRISPR could detect as low as 1.2 copies HIV-1 p24 plasmid DNA in both real-time andendpoint visual detection in 40 min, which was further verified by the denaturing PAGE (Figure3B). Although incubated for 40 min, the AIOD-CRISPR actually could identify 1.2 copies ofHIV-1 DNA in just 1 min incubation based on endpoint fluorescence as shown in Figure 3C,which showed that our AIOD-CRISPR assay provides a super-fast and ultra-sensitiveapproach for nucleic acid detection.Next, we applied the AIOD-CRISPR assay to detect HIV-1 RNA sequence by adding AvianMyeloblastosis Virus (AMV) Reverse Transcriptase, namely reverse transcriptionAIODCRISPR (RT-AIOD-CRISPR). The HIV RNA target is a 1057-nt fragment of gag (p24 included)gene prepared using T7 promotor-tagged RT-PCR and T7 RNA polymerase-basedtranscription (Figure S4A). The detection region of AIOD-CRISPR was further verified bySanger sequencing (Figure S4B). To achieve highly sensitive HIV RNA detection, weoptimized the AMV concentration. As shown in Figure S4C, the RT-AIOD-CRISPR performedthe highest efficiency with 0.32 U/\u03bcL AMV when incubated at 37\u00b0C. Furthermore, weinvestigated the sensitivity of our RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay using 1.1\u00d7 100,1.1\u00d7 101, 1.1\u00d7 103,and 1.1\u00d7 105 copies of HIV-1 gag RNA templates. Figure 4A shows that RT-AIOD-CRISPRincubated for 40 min at 37\u00b0C was able to consistently detect 11 copies RNA targets inrealtime, endpoint fluorescence, and visual detections under LED blue and UV light. However,visual detection without excitation light only identified 1.1\u00d7 105 copies RNA targets due tounsaturated fluorescence for other reactions. Additionally, the RT-AIOD-CRISPR\u2019s sensitivitywas further confirmed by denaturing PAGE analysis (Figure S5).In addition to assaying artificial HIV-1 gag RNA, we also analysed RT-AIOD-CRISPR\u2019sperformance using HIV-1 RNA extracted from plasma samples. As shown in Figure 4B,realtime RT-AIO-Cas12aR-based detection was able to detect the viral RNA extracted from 500copies/\u03bcL HIV-1 plasma sample, though displaying low fluorescence change in less than 20min. However, visual RT-AIOD-CRISPR detection took relatively long incubation time (up to90 min) to achieve the similar sensitivity. The reduced efficiency of RT-AIOD-CRISPR likelyresults from some potential inhibitors or disruptors in the extracts. Despite this, real-timeAIODCRISPR assay was still comparable to real-time RT-PCR assay regarding the same detectionsensitivity (Figure 4C and S6).SARS-CoV-2 detection by AIOD-CRISPR assay. As shown in Figure 5A, a pUCIDT-AMPplasmid containing 384 nt SARS-CoV-2 N gene cDNA (N plasmid) was first prepared as thetarget to develop our AIOD-CRISPR assay. Figure 5B shows that our AIOD-CRISPR assaycould detect 1.3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 N plasmids in both real-time and visual detectionswithin 40 min, offering a rapid and nearly single-molecule level sensitive detection. To evaluatethe detection specificity, we tested our AIOD-CRISPR assay using commercially availablecontrol plasmids containing the complete N gene from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 _PC),SARS (SARS-CoV_PC), and MERS (MERS-CoV_PC), as well as the Hs_RPP30 control(Hs_RPP30_PC) with a portion of human RPP30 gene. Figure 5C shows that only thereaction with SARS-CoV-2_PC shows the positive signal in both real-time and visualdetections, demonstrating that our developed AIOD-CRISPR assay possesses high specificitywithout cross reactions for non-SARS-CoV-2 targets.Next, we used T7 promotor-tagged PCR and T7 RNA polymerase to prepare SARS-CoV-2 Ngene RNA sequences to develop the RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay (Figure 6A). The detectionregion of RT-AIOD-CRISPR was verified by Sanger sequencing (Figure 6B). As shown inFigure 6C, both real-time and visual AIOD-CRISPR-based detections could detect down to4.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 N RNA targets in 40 min. Therefore, our AIOD-CRISPR assay isdemonstrated to be a rapid, highly sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection method.In this study, we describe a new CRISPR-Cas12a reaction, AIOD-CRISPR in which allcomponents are incubated in a single reaction system to rapidly, highly sensitively andspecifically detect nucleic acids without separate preamplification steps. Upon the design ofAIOD-CRISPR, dual crRNAs are introduced to improve the sensitivity and high-concentrationssDNA-FQ reporters are added to strengthen the detection signals. In addition to real-timedetection, AIOD-CRISPR assay is also beneficial for point-of-care detection because itsdetection results can be visually judged based on the fluorescence and color change ofreaction solutions. As proof-of-concept assays, AIOD-CRISPR has been successfullydeveloped for SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 detection.Compared to previously reported CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection,14, 16, 18, 23, 24, 25 ourversatile and robust AIOD-CRISPR has some distinctive advantages. First, AIOD-CRISPRsystem is a true single reaction system. All the components are prepared prior to incubation,thoroughly circumventing the preamplification of target nucleic acids,14 physical separation ofCas enzyme,25 or the requirement of specially designed tubes or devices26. Second,AIODCRISPR is a true isothermal nucleic acid detection method. AIOD-CRISPR is conducted inone-step and one-pot format at one temperature, eliminating the need of expensivethermocycler in PCR methods and the initial denaturing of dsDNA targets in isothermal nucleicacid amplification techniques such as LAMP 8 and SDA 27. Third, AIOD-CRISPR-baseddetection is very fast, robust, highly specific, and nearly single-molecule sensitive. In theapplication examples of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 detections, our engineered AIOD-CRISPRwithout preamplification is able to detect as low as 1.2 copies DNA targets and 4.6 copiesRNA targets in 40 min incubation. Especially in detecting HIV-1 p24 plasmids, AIOD-CRISPRcan stably identify 1.2 copies in just 1 min incubation. For emerging SARS-CoV-2, in additionto high sensitivity, the AIOD-CRISPR also performs high detection specificity. Compared tothe reported real-time RPA 28, AIOD-CRISPR shows a robust HIV-1 detection with very lowbackground. Fourth, the AIOD-CRISPR enables one-step CRISPR-Cas12a-based RNAdetection. By supplementing AMV reverse transcriptase, AIOD-CRISPR can be easilydeveloped as one-step RT-AIOD-CRISPR to detect RNA targets such as HIV-1 andSARSCoV-2 RNAs, which facilitates the CRISPR-Cas12a-based RNA detection without thepreparation of cDNA. On detecting HIV-1 plasma samples, AIOD-CRISPR is comparable toreal-time RT-PCR assay.In summary, AIOD-CRISPR using a true single reaction system is a rapid, robust, highlyspecific, and nearly single-molecule sensitive isothermal nucleic acid detection method. Thisstraightforward CRISPR-Cas12a nucleic acid sensing system has great potential in enablingCRISPR-based next-generation molecular diagnostics towards point-of-care, quantitation,and digital analysis.Materials.

In this study, we reported an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed \"AIOD-CRISPR\")assay for rapid, ultrasensitive, specific and visual detection of nucleic acid. Dual crRNAs areintroduced to initiate highly efficient CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection. When incubating the AIOD-CRISPR system in one pot at 37\u00b0C, RPA amplification is firstinitiated and exposes the binding sites of the Cas12a-crRNA complexes due to the stranddisplacement. Similarly, RPA amplified products are also the substrates to undertake the sameprocess and continuously trigger CRISPR-Cas12a-based collateral cleavage activity. The ssDNA-FQ reporterwas a 5 nt oligonucleotide (5'-TTATT-3') labelled by 5' 6-FAM (Fluorescein) fluorophore and3' Iowa Black\u00ae FQ quencher. Thus, these results show that our AIOD-CRISPR assay provides a simple,rapid, one-pot approach for target-specific nucleic acid detection. Doubling the amount of crRNA1or crRNA2 actually didn\u2019t benefit the detection efficiency. The detection region of AIOD-CRISPR was further verified bySanger sequencing (Figure S4B). To achieve highly sensitive HIV RNA detection, weoptimized the AMV concentration. As shown in Figure 4B,realtime RT-AIO-Cas12aR-based detection was able to detect the viral RNA extracted from 500copies/\u03bcL HIV-1 plasma sample, though displaying low fluorescence change in less than 20min. To evaluatethe detection specificity, we tested our AIOD-CRISPR assay using commercially availablecontrol plasmids containing the complete N gene from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 _PC),SARS (SARS-CoV_PC), and MERS (MERS-CoV_PC), as well as the Hs_RPP30 control(Hs_RPP30_PC) with a portion of human RPP30 gene. As proof-of-concept assays, AIOD-CRISPR has been successfullydeveloped for SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 detection. Second,AIODCRISPR is a true isothermal nucleic acid detection method. In summary, AIOD-CRISPR using a true single reaction system is a rapid, robust, highlyspecific, and nearly single-molecule sensitive isothermal nucleic acid detection method. AcroMetrix\u2122 HIV-1 plasmacontrol samples, dNTP Set (100 mM), Gel Loading Buffer II (Denaturing PAGE), PureLink\u2122Quick Gel Extraction Kit and TURBO DNA-free\u2122 Kit were purchased from Thermo FisherScientific (Waltham, MA). Component B consisted of 4 \u03bcM of ssDNA-FQreporters and 1\u00d7 Core Reaction Buffer. The concentration in each componentwas calculated based on the finally assembled 25-\u03bcL AIOD-CRISPR system. For RT-AIOD-CRISPR assays, most componentswere the same as those in the AIOD-CRISPR system above, except supplementing 0.32 U/\u03bcLAMV Reverse Transcriptase in Component A. Real-time fluorescence detection was carriedout in the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch\u2122 Real-Time PCR Detection System. All thereactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 40 min or the denoted time in figures. The endpointfluorescence was the raw fluorescence determined by the Real-Time PCR Detection System. Thethermal cycling protocol included 30 min at 50\u00b0C for reverse transcription, 15 min at 95\u00b0C forinitial PCR activation, 35 cycles of the 3-step cycling (1 min at 94\u00b0C for denaturation, 1 min at55\u00b0C for annealing, and 1 min at 72\u00b0C for extension), and 10 min at 50\u00b0C for final extension. Afterwards, the products with the accurate sizeswere extracted and purified using the Gel Extraction Kit. In vitro transcription was achievedthrough incubating the reaction system containing 8 \u03bcL of 5\u00d7 T7 Transcription Buffer, 3 \u03bcLeach of 100 mM rNTPs, 4 \u03bcL of the Enzyme Mix with T7 RNA polymerase, 16 \u03bcL of thegelextracted PCR/RT-PCR products at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. Then, the transcription products were treatedby DNase (from the TURBO DNA-free TM Kit) to degrading the DNA and the RNA wasextracted and purified using the RNeasy@ MinElute TM Cleanup Kit.
