Trump is poisedto win another presidential term. Boris Johnson may bethe UK\u2019s Prime Minister for a decade. And don\u2019t forgetJair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi, and Rodrigo Duterte.*The idea that human beings are reshaping the contoursof life and the possibilities for life is what we now call theAnthropocene. But when discussing the Anthropocene,we often make the mistake of assuming that humanactions take place within xfied, static entities\u2014countries,cities, communities. While we acknowledge the force ofpeople, we pay too little attention to the oflw. And yetit is the oflw of people that is having far greater politicalimpact and reach. Fear of migration is one of the mainreasons for the emergence and expression of politicalpopulism. At last week\u2019s Global Health Lab, held at theLondon School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, we asked,\u201cWhat is the impact of populism on global health?\u201dTim Haughton, Jonathan Kennedy, Chiara Rinaldi, andMartin McKee sought to answer that question withan audience of the School\u2019s students and faculty. Theresult was dispiriting. Populism is the idea of a pureand virtuous people uniting together against a corruptestablishment elite. It is a nativism where \u201cpeople\u201dmeans a particular ethnic or religious group. Migration isa powerful political force because it has given permissionto political parties\u2014especially parties of the radicalright\u2014to burnish their populist credentials, to demonisewhat they portray as undeserving foreigners, to createhostile environments, to erode the rights of minorities,to foster fears of invasion, and to use systems of socialprotection to implement systems of social exclusion andcontrol. And yet we are paralysed. We genuinely don\u2019tknow what to do. Do we ignore, confront, or copy thepopulists? We have no credible response.*The political weaponisation of migration is a threatto ideas of universality, equity, and justice, ideasthat are central to our concepts of health and healthcare. According to the International Organization forMigration (IOM), there are 272 million internationalmigrants today\u2014people living in a country other thantheir own. The IOM emphasises how small this numberis: just 3\u00b75% of the world\u2019s population. But that gfiurestill represents over half the population of the EuropeanUnion. It is a vast signal of human vulnerability. Andplease consider the trajectory. The highest number ofinternally displaced persons from violence and coniflcton record today (41\u00b73 million people). The increasingimpact of a growing environmental crisis, with anestimated 1 billion climate refugees by 2100. The risingimportance of food insecurity among migrants. Thegradual feminisation of labour migration. And thethreats to global health security from migration in anera of new infectious epidemics, as the 2019 novelcoronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak shows only tootragically. Last week, The Lancet announced the launch ofLancet Migration, a new global collaboration to advancemigration health. This initiative follows the 2018publication of our UCL\u2013Lancet Commission on Migrationand Health, chaired by Ibrahim Abubakar. Miriam Orcuttis Lancet Migration\u2019s Executive Director and she will leada programme of work on migration\u2019s intersection withuniversal health coverage, the climate emergency, andgender. The academic community can\u2019t retreat in the faceof extreme political populism, which is fuelling racism,xenophobia, and hate. We have to do something. LancetMigration is our eofrt to resist.
