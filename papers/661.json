These data comprise 20 whole genome sequences from confirmed33 COVID19 infections in Weifang, Shandong Province, People\u2019s Republic of China. The data were34 collected over the course of several weeks up to February 10, 2020 and overlap with a period35 of intensifying public health and social distancing measures. Phylodynamic analysis allows us to36 evaluate epidemiological trends after seeding events which took place in mid to late January, 2020.37 The objective of our analysis is to evaluate epidemiological trends based on national surveillance38 and response efforts by Weifang Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This analysis provides an39 estimate of the initial rate of spread and reproduction number in Weifang City. In contrast to the40 early spread of COVID19 in Hubei Province of China, most community transmissions within Weifang41 took place after public health interventions and social distancing measures were put in place. We42 therefore hypothesize that genetic data should reflect a lower growth rate and reproduction number43 than was observed in Wuhan. A secondary aim is to estimate the total numbers infected and to44 evaluate the possibility that there is a large unmeasured burden of infection due to imperfect case45 ascertainment and a large proportion of infections with mild or asymptomatic illness.46 To analyze the Weifang sequences, we have adapted model-based phylodynamic methods47 which were previously used to estimate growth rates and reproduction numbers using sequence48 data from Wuhan and exported international cases(Volz et al., 2020). This analysis has several49 constraints and requirements:5051 Importation of lineages from Wuhan. The outbreak in Weifang was seeded by multiple lineages52 imported at various times from the rest of China. We use a phylodynamic model that accounts for53 location of sampling. Migration is modeled as a bi-directional process with rates proportional to54 epidemic size in Weifang. The larger international reservoir of COVID19 cases serves as a source of55 new infections and is assumed to be growing exponentially over this period of time.56 Nonlinear epidemiological dynamics in Weifang. The maximum number of daily confirmed COVID1957 cases occurred on February 5, but it is unknown when the maximum prevalence of infectionoc58 curred. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model(Keeling and Rohani, 2011)59 for epidemic dynamics in Weifang. The model accounts for a realistic distribution of generation60 times and can potentially capture a nonlinear decrease in cases following epidemic peak.61 Variance in transmission rates(Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005).To estimate total numbers infected, the62 phylodynamic model must account for epidemiological variables which are known to significantly63 influence genetic diversity. Foremost among these is the variance in offspring distribution (number64 of transmissions per primary case). We draw on previous evidence based on the previous SARS65 epidemic which indicates that the offspring distribution is highly over-dispersed. High variance of66 transmission rates will reduce genetic diversity of a sample and failure to account for this factor67 will lead to highly biased estimates of epidemic size(Li et al., 2017). Recent analyses of sequence68 data drawn primarily from Wuhan has found that high over-dispersion was required for estimated69 cases to be consistent with the epidemiological record(Volz et al., 2020). Models assuming low70 variance in transmission rates between people would generate estimates of cases that are lower71 than the known number of confirmed cases. Separately, Grantz et al.(Grantz et al., ????) have72 found that high over-dispersion is required to reconcile estimated reproduction numbers with73 the observed frequency of international outbreaks. In this study, we elaborate the SEIR model to74 include a compartment(J ) with higher transmission rates. The variance of the implied offspring75 distribution is calibrated to give similar overdispersion from the SARS epidemic.76 Results77 Despite an initial rapid increase in confirmed cases in Weifang in late January and early February, the78 number of confirmed cases by Weifang CDC show that outbreak peaked quite early and maximum79 number of cases ocurred on February 5. Phylodynamic analysis supports the interpretation that80 control efforts reduced epidemic growth rates and contributed to eventual control. Figure 1A81 shows the estimated time scaled phylogeny (maximum clade credibility) including 20 lineages82 sampled from distinct patients in Weifang and 33 genomes sampled from Wuhan and internationally.83 Figure 1B illustrates the phylodynamic model which was co-estimated with the phylogeny which84 provides estimates of epidemiological parameters summarized in Table 1.85 The estimated number of infections is shown Figure 1C. The time series of confirmed cases86 should lag the estimated number of infected because of delays from infection to appearance of87 symptoms and delays from symptoms to diagnosis. We also expect that an unknown proportion of88 infections will be missed by the surveillance system due very mild, subclinical, or asymptomatic89 infection. Our estimates do not support the hypothesis that there was a very large hidden burden90 of infection in Weifang over the period that the sequence data were sampled. Indeed, our central91 estimate for the number infected on 10th February is 53, which is only slightly in excess of the 4492 cumulative confirmed cases at the end of February.colour of tips corresponds to location sampling. Red tips were sampled from Weifang, China. The credible interval of TMRCA is shown as a blue barfor all nodes with more than 50% posterior support. B.

These interventions included public health messaging,99 establishing phone hotlines, encouraging home isolation for recent vitors from Wuhan (January100 23-26), optimizing triage of suspected cases in hospitals (January 24), travel restrictions(January 26),101 extending school closures, and establishing \u2018fever clinics\u2019 for consulatation and diagnosis(January102 27)(Mao, 2020).103 As well as providing novel epidemiological estimates, our results point to the significance of104 realistic modeling for fidelity of phylogenetic inference. The use of a model-based structuredcoa105 lescent prior had large influence over estimated molecular clock rates and inferred TMRCAs. Figure106 Supplement 1 shows that maximum likelihood inference of time-scaled phylogenies produces a107 distribution of TMRCAs which are substantially different than the Bayesian model-based analysis.108 Choice of population genetic prior will have a large influence on phylogenetic inference based on109 sparse or poorly informative genetic sequence data. Among the 20 Weifang sequences included in110 this analysis, there is mean pairwise difference of only three single nucleotide polymorphisms and111 only approximately twice as much diversity observed among the remainder of the sequences we112 studied. There is correspondingly low confidence in tree topology (Figure Supplement 2), and only113 three clades had greater than 50% posterior support including one clade which had a monophyletic114 compoisition of 13 Weifang lineages. The earliest Weifang sequence was sampled on January 25115 from a patient who showed first symptoms on January 16. These dates cover a similar range as the116 posterior TMRCA of all Weifang sequences (Figure Supplement 3).117 Discussion118 Our analysis of 20 SARS-CoV 2 genomes from Weifang, China has confirmed independentobserva119 tions regarding the rate of spread and burden of infection in the city. Surveillance of COVID19 is120 rendered difficult by high proportions of illness with mild severity and an unknown proportion of121 asymptomatic infection(Guan et al., 2020). The extent of under-reporting and case ascertainment122 rates has been widely debated. Analysis of genetic sequence data provides an alternative source of123 information about epidemic size which can be more robust to imperfect case ascertainment. We do124 not find evidence for a large hidden burden of infection within Weifang. The relatively low estimate125 of R0 is consistent with a slower rate of spread outside of Wuhan and effective control strategies126 implemented in late January.127 While the value of pathogen genomic analyses is widely recognized for estimating dates of128 emergence(Verity Hill, 2020; Gire et al., 2014) and identifying animal reservoirs(Zhou et al., 2020;129 Dudas et al., 2018), analysis of pathogen sequences also has potential to inform epidemicsurveil130 lance and intervention efforts. With few exceptions (Stadler, 2020; Bedford, 2020), this potential131 is currently not being realized for the international response to COVID19. It is worth noting that132 the analysis described in this report was accomplished in approximately 48 hours and drew on133 previously developed models and packages for BEAST2(Bouckaert et al., 2019; Volz and Siveroni,134 2018). It is therefore feasible for phylodynamic analysis to provide a rapid supplement toepidemio135 logical surveillance, however this requires rapid sequencing and timely sharing of data as well as136 randomized concentrated sampling of the epidemic within localities such as individual cities.137 Methods and Materials138 Epidemiological investigation, sampling, and genetic sequencing. As of 10 February 2020, 136139 suspected cases, and 214 close contacts were diagnosed by Weifang Center for Disease Control and140 Prevention. 28 cases were detected positive with SARS-CoV-2. Viral RNA was extracted using Maxwell141 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega AS1150) by magnetic bead method and RNeasy142 Mini Kit (QIAGEN 74104) by column method. RT-qPCR was carried out using 2019 novel coronavirus143 nucleic acid detection kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China) to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral144 RNA with cycle threshold (Ct) values range from 17 to 37, targeting the high conservative region145 (ORF1ab/N gene) in SARS-CoV-2 genome. Metagenomic sequencing: The concentration of RNA146 samples was measurement by Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).147 DNase was used to remove host DNA. The remaining RNA was used to construct the single-stranded148 circular DNA library with MGIEasy RNA Library preparation reagent set (MGI, Shenzhen, China).149 Purified RNA was then fragmented. Using these short fragments as templates, random hexamers150 were used to synthesize the first-strand cDNA, followed by the second strand synthesis. Using151 the short double-strand DNA, a DNA library was constructed through end repair, adaptor ligation,152 and PCR amplification. PCR products were transformed into a single strand circular DNA library153 through DNA-denaturation and circularization. DNA nanoballs (DNBs) were generated with the154 single-stranded circular DNA library by rolling circle replication (RCR). The DNBs were loaded into155 the flow cell and pair-end 100bp sequencing on the DNBSEQ-T7 platform 8 (MGI, Shenzhen, China).156 20 genomes were assembled with length from 26,840 to 29,882 nucleotides. The median age of157 patients was 36 (range:6-75). Two of twenty patients suffered severe or critical illness. Weifang158 sequences were combined with a diverse selection of sequences from China outside of Weifang and159 other countries provided by GISAIDElbe and Buckland-Merrett (2017). The new Weifang sequences160 are deposited in GISAID (XXXX-XXXX).Mathematical model. The phylodynamic model is designed to account for nonlinear epidemicdynamics in Weifang, a realistic course of infection (incubation and infectious periods), migration oflineages in and out of Weifang, and variance in transmission rates which can influence epidemicsize estimates. The model of epidemic dynamics within Weifang is based on asusceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We elaborate the model with with an additional compartmentJ which has a higher transmission rate ( -fold higher) than the I compartment. Upon leaving theincubation period individuals progress to the J compartment with probability ph, or otherwise to I.The model is implemented as a system of ordinary differential equations:S\u0086 .t/ = * . I.t/ + J .t// S.t/ + I.t/S+.tJ/ .t/ + R.t/ (1)E\u0086 .t/ = . I.t/ + J .t// S.t/ + I.t/S+.tJ/ .t/ + R.t/ * 0E.t/ (2)I\u0086 .t/ = 0.1 * ph/E.t/ * 1I.t/J\u0086 .t/ = 0phE.t/ * 1J .t/R\u0086 .t/ = 1.E.t/ + J .t//(3)(4)(5)We also model an exponentially growing reservoir Y .t/ for imported lineages in to Weifang. Theequation governing this population isY\u0086 .t/ = . * /Y .t/:(6)161 Migration is modeled as a bidirectional process which only depends on the size of variables in162 the Weifang compartment and thus migration does not influence epidemic dynamics; it will only163 influence the inferred probability that a lineage resides within Weifang. For a compartment X (E,I,164 or J), is the per lineage rate of migration out of Weifang and the total rate of migration in and out165 of Weifang is X.166 During phylodynamic model fitting and are estimated. Additionally, we estimate initial sizes167 of Y , E, and S. Other parameters are fixed based on prior information. We fix 1_ 0 = 4:1days and168 1_ 1 = 3:8 days. We set ph = 0:20 and = 74 which yields a dispersion of the reproduction number169 that matches a negative binomial distribution with k = 0:22 if R0 = 2, similar to values estimated for170 the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005).171 Phylogenetic analysis. We aligned the 20 Weifang sequences using MAFFT(Katoh and Standley,172 2013) with a previous aligment of 35 SARS-CoV 2 sequences from outside of Weifang(Volz et al.,173 2020). Maximum likelihood analysis was carried using IQTree(Minh et al., 2019) with a HKY+G4174 substitution model and a time-scaled tree was estimated using treedater 0.5.0(Volz and Frost, 2017).175 Two outliers according to the molecular clock model were identified and removed using \u2018treedater\u2019176 which was also used to compute the root to tip regression.177 Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was carried out using BEAST 2.6.1(Bouckaert et al., 2019) using a178 HKY+G4 substitution model and a strict molecular clock. The phylodynamic model was implemented179 using the PhyDyn package(Volz and Siveroni, 2018) using the QL likelihood approximation and the180 RK ODE solver. The model was fitted by running 8 MCMC chains in parallel and combining chains181 after removing 50% burn-in.182 The ggtree package was used for all phylogeny visualizations(Yu et al., 2017).183 Code to replicate this analysis and and BEAST XML files can be found at https://github.com/184 emvolz/weifang-sarscov2.185 Funding186 This work was supported by Centre funding from the UK Medical Research Council under acon187 cordat with the UK Department for International Development.
