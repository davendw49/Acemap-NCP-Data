The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has causedglobal panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differencesbetween the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore,is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory featuresof COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and CochraneRegister of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 orMERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate ofintensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPadPrism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV= 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared withCOVID19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge andfatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weaknessand myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereasARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin andinterferon.rate, Fatality rate.          Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with envelope and non-segmented positive-sense,causing respiratory and intestinal tract infections in humans and other mammals [          As December 8, 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases linked to Huananseafood wholesale market has been reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China [5-6]. Clinicalcharacteristics of this pneumonia were very similar to those of viral pneumonia such asMERS-COV, initially severe acute respiratory infection, followed by developing rapidly acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even acute respiratory failure [7]. Sequencing datafrom throat swab samples of a patient indicated a novel coronavirus subsequently namedcorona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by world health organization (WHO). So far, morethan 70000 confirmed cumulative cases have been reported in China, and more than 10000confirmed cumulative cases in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran and theUSA.Although many previous studies have reported clinical characteristics of COVID-19 orMERS-COV diseases [8-11], systematic comparison of clinical features between COVID-19and MERS-COV diseases has yet been published. Thus, the purpose of this study is toperform a systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics ofpatients infected by COVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, and to compare COVID-19 andMERS-COV in the context of their incubation, laboratory features, admission rate of intensivecure unit (ICU) and rate of discharge and fatality, which will provide a comprehensivereference for clinical physicians in treatment of coronavirus diseases.A comprehensive and systematic search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE andCochrane Register of Controlled Trials database up to 26 February 2020. Medical SubjectHeading (MSH) terms and keywords were used so as to retrieve as many potential documentsas possible. Terms for MERS-COV included: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus[Mesh] OR MERS-CoV OR MERS Virus OR MERS Viruses OR Virus, MERS OR Viruses,MERS OR Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus OR Middle East respiratorysyndrome related coronavirus. They were combined with terms specifying COVID-19:((Wuhan coronavirus) OR (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus) OR (SARS2) OR(COVID-19 virus) OR (coronavirus disease 2019 virus) OR (SARS-CoV-2) OR (2019-nCoV)OR (2019 novel coronavirus)). If necessary, we also contacted corresponding author to obtainaccurate data.The study that met following criteria were included: (1) reporting clinical characteristicsof COVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, (2) minimum sample size of five, (3) confirmedCOVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, (4) English literature. Studies were excluded as followingcriteria: duplicate publications, case report, meta-analysis, letter, review, technology report,commentary, animal trial, correspondence, predictive study, guidence, radiograph study andmeeting report.        At the beginning, 4743 potential publications were identified. We removed 678duplicates and reviewed the titles and abstracts of remaining 4065 publications. 4015publications were excluded for following reasons: not involved research point (n = 1378),review (n = 569), no English (n = 33), case report (n = 316), meta-analysis (n = 1), letter (n =127), technology report (n = 196), commentaries (n = 61), animal study (n = 1107),correspondence (n = 29), predictive study (n = 110), guidence (n = 28), meeting report ( n =16) and radiograph (n = 44). Then, a comprehensive review of full-text was conducted forremaining 50 publications. Two reviewers independently screened eligible literature, and anyargument was solved by discussion with a third reviewer. Finally, thirty-two studies wereincluded in this study [        Two reviewers extracted independently common, clinical and laboratory characteristicsof included studies, with disagreements were solved by discussion with a third reviewer. Theextracted data included incubation time, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count,creactive protein (CRP), alamine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), rate ofdischarge and fatality, symptom, comorbidity, complications and cure rate of drug. Fornormality distribution data, outcomes were extracted directly. For skewness distribution data,the outcomes was extracted after being converted as specific formula [40].The quality assessment of included studies was performed through the Newcastle-OttawaQuality Assessment Scale (NOS), as recommended by the Cochrane Non-RandomizedStudies [41]. The NOS includes three parts for risk of bias, with nine points in total: (1)selection of research groups (four points); (2) inter-group comparability (two points); and (3)ascertainment of exposure and outcomes (three points) for case\u2013control and cohort studies,respectively. Study that scored 6 or more was qualified for systematic review [42]. Theassessment process was completed by two reviewers independently. All debates were solvedby discussion with a third reviewer.All statistical analyses and graphs were generated and plotted using GraphPad Prismversion 7.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc). The p value < 0.05 suggests significantdifference.        All included studies were retrospective study [                Among thirty-two included studies, four studies obtained 6 points of NOS [26, 28, 32,35], and remaining twenty-eight studies obtained 7 points of NOS or more [        For COVID-19 population, the number of patients with fever was 480 (45.2%), coughwas 373 (35.1%), generalised weakness and myalgia was 318 (29.9%), stuffy or rhinorrhoeawas 6 (0.6%), pharyngalgia was 32 (3%), chest pain was 10 (0.9%), diarrhoea or anorexia was123 (11.6%), dyspnoea was 140 (13.2%) and dizziness or headache was 60 (5.6%). ForMERS-COV population, the amount of patients with fever was 404 (14.9%), cough was 424(15.7%), generalised weakness and myalgia was 337 (12.4%), stuffy or rhinorrhoea was 17(0.6%), pharyngalgia was 47 (1.7%), chest pain was 27 (1%), diarrhoea or anorexia was 128(4.7%), dyspnoea was 271 (10%) and dizziness or headache was 131 (4.8%). The Aboveresults were shown in Table 4.For COVID-19 population, the main complications included shock, arrhythmia, acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury and acuteliver injury, and the amount of which was 17 (1.6%), 28 (2.6%), 51 (4.8%), 11 (1%), 10(0.9%) and 2 (0.2%) respectively. For MERS-COV population, the number of individualspresented shock was 22 (0.8%), arrhythmia was 11 (0.4%), ARDS was 83 (3.1%), acutecardiac injury 10 (0.4%), acute kidney injury was 30 (1.1%), acute liver injury was 22 (0.8%)and neurological symptoms was 4 (0.1%). The results were shown in Table 5.Among COVID-19 population, 43 (4%) patients had diabetes, 101 (9.5%) patients hadhypertension, 77 (7.3%) patients had cardiovascular disease, 10 (0.9%) patients had chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 19 (1.8%) patients had malignancy, 24 (2.3%)patients had chronic liver disease, 13 (1.2%) patients had cerebrovascular disease and 5(0.5%) patients had chronic kidney disease. Among MERS-COV population, the number ofpatients with diabetes was 247 (9.1%), hypertension was 244 (9%), cardiovascular diseasewas 161 (5.9%), COPD was 83 (3.1%), malignancy was 70 (2.6%), chronic liver disease was28 (1%), cerebrovascular disease was 47 (1.7%), chronic kidney disease was 167 (6.2%) andobesity was 42 (1.6%). Those results were shown in Table 6.Systematic review was performed for clinical and laboratory outcomes of coronavirusdisease. There was no significant difference in age (50.9 \u00b1 2 vs. 53.6 \u00b1 1.5, P = 0.3), WBC(5.7 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 7.6 \u00b1 1, P = 0.1), lymphocyte count (1.1 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 0.8 \u00b1 0.1, P = 0.2), CRP (37.6\u00b1 5.8 vs. 13.9 \u00b1 11.3, P = 0.1), ALT (28 \u00b1 3.1 vs. 37.3 \u00b1 5.1, P = 0.2), creatinine (74.5 \u00b1 0.4vs. 101.4 \u00b1 18.5, P = 0.2) and creatine kinase (109.1 \u00b1 20 vs. 136.4 \u00b1 23.1, P = 0.5) betweenCOVID-19 and MERS-COV population. Compared with COVID-19 population, a higherAST (31.5 \u00b1 2.4 vs. 58.3 \u00b1 7.6, P = 0.009) and longer incubtion time (5.1 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 7.4 \u00b1 0.4, P= 0.02) were found in MERS-COV population. The results were shown in Table 7.The higher admission rate of ICU was found in MERS-COV population than inCOVID19 population ( 43.6% vs. 22.4%, Figure 2). There was a higher discharge rate inCOV populations compared with COVID-19 population ( 59.9% vs. 33.5%, Figure 3). Thelower fatality rate was found in COVID-19 population compared withOf 93 patients treated by ribavirin and interferon, 67 (74.2%) were cured. Of 39 patientstreated by oseltamivir, 27 (69.2%) were cured. Of 70 patients treated by antivirals, 47 (67.1%)were cured. Of 8 patients treated by intravenous immunoglobulin, 5 (62.5%) were cured. Of 9patients treated by ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir, 4 (44.4%) were cured. Of 18 patientstreated by corticosteroids, 7 (38.9%) were cured. The results were shown in Figure 5.Coronavirus is an important pathogen causing respiratory and intestinal infection. Ofseven identified coronaviruses, the two very pathogenic viruses, SARS-COV andMERSCOV, cause severe ARDS and even acute respiratory failure. With a mortality rate of morethan 10% and more than 35% respectively [43-44]. The four other human coronaviruses(HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1) only cause mild respiratory orintestinal infection, despite they have certain pathogenicity for infants, young children and theelderly with weakened immune systems [45-46]. The newest one is COVID-19. Thesequencing analysis has indicated that COVID-19, like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, belongsto \u03b2-coronavirus. Both SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated in bats, but the origin ofCOVID-19 remains to be further investigated. Although recent studies have reported theclinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, systematic comparsion between COVID-19and MERS-COV has yet been performed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform thefirst systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics ofCOVID-19 and MERS-COV populations. Our results suggested that fever, cough andgeneralised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 andMERS-COV, whereas ARDSwasmain complication. Comparedwithpopulation, COVID-19 population had a less incubation time and lower rate of ICUadmission, discharge and fatality.Similarities of clinical characteristics between COVID-19 and MERS-COV have beenfound. In the current study, the majority of COVID-19 patients presented with fever, coughand generalised weakness and myalgia, which shows some resemblances to MERS-COVinfection. Moreover, both COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients hardly developed upperrespiratory tract infection such as rhinorrhoea or pharyngalgia, indicating that their target cellsmight be located in lower respiratory. However, 11.6% of patients with COVID-19 infectionhad diarrhoea or anorexia, and only 4.7% of patients with MERS-COV infection had thissymptom. Thus, Faces and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternativeway of transmission that is unknown to the present.In addition, we found that the number of males is more than that of females in eitherCOVID-19 or MERS-COV population. The possible reason of reduced susceptibility offemales to viral infection is that females have a lot of X chromosome and estrogen that arevital components in development of innate and adaptive immunity [47]. Meanwhile, numbersof patients with COVID-19 infection had chronic comorbidities, mainly hypertension,diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which is similar to MERS-COV population. Thoseresults indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be moresusceptibility to COVID-19 or MERS-COV.In terms of laboratory testing, reduced lymphocytes and increased CRP were found inboth COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients. This result indicates that COVID-19 might beassociated with cellular immune response, mainly act on lymphocytes like MERS-COV does[48]. The cells infected by viruses induce the release of numbers of pro-inflammatorycytokines and inflammation storm in the body. Moreover, increased cytokines might makedamage to related organs such as liver [49]. Our results demonstrated that abnormal value ofAST was found in MERS-COV population, but not in COVID-19 population. The possiblereason is that the follow-up time of COVID-19 population was too short, and the liver mightremain to be in compensatory stage. For this result, a long follow-up time study is urgentlyneeded. On the other hand, our results suggested that MERS-COV population had a higherrate of ICU admission and fatality than COVID-19 population, indicating that compared withMERS-COV, COVID-19 has less toxic and more easily cured. However, lower discharge ratewas found in COVID population than in MERS-COV population. The possible explanation isthat most of COVID-19 patients remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscriptsubmission, and data on those patients could not be obtained in time. Thus, carefulinterpretation is urged for this result.Up to now, no effective strategy has been found for treatment of COVID-19 infection[50]. Currently, the measure to COVID-19 is to control the source of the infection; takingpersonal protective works to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosing, isolatingand supportive treating for confirmed patients. In the present study, our systematic results ofcure rate of drug for MERS-COV infection indicated that ribavirin and interferon, oseltamivir,antivirals and intravenous immunoglobulin all had been effective for MERS-COV infection,with the cure rate of those drugs was 74.2%, 69.2%, 67.1% and 62.5% respectively. Thus, weassume that those drugs might also be effective at COVID-19 infection. However, furtherstudies are needed to confirm this idea.This study has several limitations. First, many patients infected by COVID-19 remainedto be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, leading to the unavailable of somedata. Second, the follow-up time of COVID-19 population is too short to get related data fromlong-term observations of this disease. Third, finding of statistical tests and p values betweenCOVID-19 and MERS-COV populations should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, thenumber of MERS-COV patients treated by drugs is small, careful understanding is needed forthe cure rate of drug for this disease. Finally, as COVID-19 is still developing around theworld and remains to have many unknowns, the results of this study are staged and need to becarefully understood. More large-sample, multicentre, high-quality research should beperformed to update this study.Our systematic review reveals that main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 andMERS-COV populations are fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia. ARDS ismain complication of both two populations. COVID-19 population has a shorter incubationtime and lower rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality compared with MRES-COVpopulation.This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation ofChina (Nos.31970862) and Guangzhou Municipal Science and Technology project (Nos.201803010001, Prof. Zhi-Zhong Li)2016.[2] Yin Y, Wunderink RG.

For MERS-COV population, the number of individualspresented shock was 22 (0.8%), arrhythmia was 11 (0.4%), ARDS was 83 (3.1%), acutecardiac injury 10 (0.4%), acute kidney injury was 30 (1.1%), acute liver injury was 22 (0.8%)and neurological symptoms was 4 (0.1%). 101.4 \u00b1 18.5, P = 0.2) and creatine kinase (109.1 \u00b1 20 vs. 136.4 \u00b1 23.1, P = 0.5) betweenCOVID-19 and MERS-COV population. Of 8 patients treated by intravenous immunoglobulin, 5 (62.5%) were cured. Ofseven identified coronaviruses, the two very pathogenic viruses, SARS-COV andMERSCOV, cause severe ARDS and even acute respiratory failure. With a mortality rate of morethan 10% and more than 35% respectively [43-44]. The four other human coronaviruses(HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1) only cause mild respiratory orintestinal infection, despite they have certain pathogenicity for infants, young children and theelderly with weakened immune systems [45-46]. Moreover, both COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients hardly developed upperrespiratory tract infection such as rhinorrhoea or pharyngalgia, indicating that their target cellsmight be located in lower respiratory. Thoseresults indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be moresusceptibility to COVID-19 or MERS-COV.In terms of laboratory testing, reduced lymphocytes and increased CRP were found inboth COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients. Thus, weassume that those drugs might also be effective at COVID-19 infection. Third, finding of statistical tests and p values betweenCOVID-19 and MERS-COV populations should be interpreted with caution. COVID-19 population has a shorter incubationtime and lower rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality compared with MRES-COVpopulation.
