On thefrontline, tactical response to COVID-19is similar to that of SARS but one majordiference exists: in the 17 years sinceSARS, a powerful new tool has emergedthat could potentially be instrumentalin keeping this virus within reasonablelimits\u2014namely, artificial intelligence(AI).Few would argue that AI is causing aparadigm shift in health care and theremight be value in the application of AIto the current COVID-19 outbreak, forexample, in predicting the location ofthe next outbreak. This applicationis effectively what the Canadiancompany, Blue Dot, has attempted todo and as such was widely reported asthe first organisation to reveal newsof the outbreak in late December.Various other applications of AI thathave emerged in response to the latestepidemic include BenevolentAI andImperial College London, which reportthat a drug approved for rheumatoidarthritis, baricitinib, might be efectiveagainst the virus, while InsilicoMedicine based in Hong Kong recentlyannounced that its AI algorithms haddesigned six new molecules that couldhalt viral replication.But to what extent is AI really at thepoint where it can deliver effectiveinsights and solutions in a timely,widescale fashion to help halt thecurrent epidemic?As Executive Director of theCommunicable Diseases Cluster, WHO,David Heymann led the internationalresponse to SARS. He explains thatAI or no AI, several key factors arerequired for a successful publichealth response to an outbreak of anew infection. These factors includeunderstanding of transmissibilityand risk populations; establishing thenatural history of infection, includingincubation period and mortality rate;identifying and characterising thecausative organism; and, in someinstances, epidemiological modellingto suggest efective prevention andcontrol measures. This informationcan be collected from those workingat outbreak sites virtually linkedwith WHO. This strategy worked forSARS and is, again, a major sourceof information for COVID-19, hestresses.Collectively these data can be used totrain and prime the AI application forits dedicated task. \u201cWe can\u2019t replacethe human brain at this point, northe epidemiologist or virologist withanything that can analyse and rapidlydo what is necessary at the onset of anoutbreak. We still need to prime thatAI with information from study of theevidence and link this to events in theoutbreak,\u201d Heymann highlights.Taking a balanced view of where AIsits in the current armamentariumto tackle COVID-19, Heymannadds \u201cBy monitoring social media,newsfeeds, or airline ticketing systemsfor example, we can tell if there\u2019ssomething wrong that requires furtherexploration. All these things togetherare very important.\u201d However,Heymann cautions that the source ofthe data needed to inform AI in thisoutbreak, \u201cwon\u2019t necessarily comefrom China because it hasn\u2019t been ableto get hold of the data it needs becauseof the disorder and panic. This virushas spread to 24 other countries andthese countries have set up extremelygood systems of contact-tracing andpatient isolation. This is where ourinformation will come from.\u201dPeter Hotez (Baylor Collegeof Medicine, Houston, TX, USA)asserts that AI can make a majorcontribution to the current outbreakand can be used to predict howthe COVID-19 outbreak might beafected by seasonality. \u201cHistorically Lancet Digital Health 2020in the Northern hemisphere, upper Published Onlinerespiratory coronaviruses peak in February 20, 2020the winter months and then decline.

The sameapplies to COVID-19. \u201cFlights are goinginto Africa, for example, into Ethiopiafrom China all the time and who knowswhat\u2019s happening there,\u201d he notes.In declaring the situation a publichealth emergency of internationalconcern, WHO Director-General, TedrosAdhanom Ghebreyesus, reflected onthe impact in less developed countries,\u201c... we don\u2019t know what type of damagethe virus could do if it were to spread toa country with a weaker health system\u201d.Moritz Kraemer, a spatialepidemiologist (University of Oxford,Oxford, UK) is involved with trackingFor more on countries at the the spread of COVID-19 as representedhighest importation risk of on the web-based platform, Healthmap,reviCeOwVedIDs-t1u9dyseheenreohnt-tppese:/r-/ which visually represents global diseasewww.medrxiv.org/content/10.11 outbreaks according to location, time,01/2020.02.05.20020792v1) and infectious disease agent. \u201cInsubFor more on using crowdsourced Saharan Africa, our model predictedpatiendtaetpaitdoemcoiloleloctgCyOdVatIDa-s1e9e that the main entry points would beArticles Lancet Digital Health in South Africa, Ethiopia, and Nigeria,2020; published online Feb 20. which are high population centres.Sh2t5t8p9s:-/7/d5o0i0.o(2rg0/)1300.0102616-1/ But it is dependent on where, in China,For more on hospital- the outbreak is focussed because theassociated transmission of number of flights to parts of AfricaCOVID-19 in Wuhan see varies by Chinese city,\u201d Kraemer pointsjournalhst/jtapms:a///jfaumllaarntiectlew/2o7rk6.1co0m44/ ou\u201ctI.n most AI applications, we considerthe question and ask what are the bestdata available to answer it?\u201d Kraemersays. One of the multiple data streamsrelevant to pathogens spread is accuratecase reporting for COVID-19. Kraemerreceives news reports and twice dailygovernment reports that providedatasets on how many cases exist in anyone specicfi location (eg, in Wuhan city).\u201cThis is a baseline for us.. Before ChineseNew Year we looked at how manypeople left Wuhan over a day, and thisinformation comes from search enginesincluding Baidu. WeChat, a messaging,social media and mobile payment app,provides data on travel around Wuhan,\u201dhe explains. \u201cMachine learning modelsuse these data to predict the most likelylocation of where novel coronavirusmight arrive next and this mightinform where and how to run borderchecks.\u201d A study by Kaiyuan Sun andcolleagues published today in The LancetDigital Health testifies to the strengthof monitoring news reports andsocial media to help reconstruct theprogression of an outbreak and toprovide detailed patient-level data inthe context of a health emergency.Not only is China central to theoutbreak, but the country is alsoplaying a large role in using AIto help manage the COVID-19outbreak. Infervision, a Beijing-basedAI company uses its algorithm tospot COVID-19 on images of the lungas distinct from other respiratoryinfections.Velislava Petrova is a virologist(University of Cambridge, Cambridge,UK), who is currently working atUNAIDS, Geneva, on the latest andmost effective AI applications. \u201cWeare trying to find a more sustainableway to control the impact of the novelcoronavirus rather than having to shutdown borders, businesses and similar,\u201dshe says.Petrova highlights that Infervision\u2019sAI application minimises the burdenof these processes by expeditingthe diagnoses and monitoring ofCOVID-19. \u201cAs more and more scansare done then the algorithm learnsand improves accuracy together withthe virus.\u201d\u201cThe value of AI comes into play byreducing the burden on clinicians in ascenario such as the current COVID-19outbreak,\u201d Petrova explains.Reflecting on a rapidly growingconcern in the current outbreak thatregards the infection of health-careprofessionals, Kuan Chen, founderof Infervision, points out that theInfervision AI application can helpprotect staff. The death of medicaldoctor, Li Wenliang, on Feb 7, 2020,who was reprimanded by Chineseauthorities for warning about thevirus, highlights the plight of clinicianson the frontline.\u201cAn article in JAMA states thathuman-to-human hospital-associatedtransmission accounted for 41%of all cases in a study of patientsat Zhongnan Hospital of WuhanUniversity,\u201d Chen notes. \u201cWe alsoknow that more than 1000 hospitalstaf in the city of Wuhan have beenconfirmed infected.\u201dThis is where Infervision\u2019s AIapplication could help. From a lungCT scan, the AI is designed to quicklydetect lesions of possible coronaviruspneumonia, to measure its volume,shape, and density, and to comparechanges of multiple lung lesionsfrom the image, which all provide aquantitative report to assist doctorsmaking fast judgement. \u201cWhile amanual read of a CT scan can take upto 15 minutes, AI can finish readingthe image in 10 seconds.\u201d Applicationof this technology in COVID-19 hasnot yet been published in apeerreviewed journal.Chen adds that in Wuhan, wherethere are far too many cases totest and PCR-based diagnosis takestoo long (sometimes over a week),CT imaging with AI could serve asa surrogate for doctors when fastjudgement is needed. \u201cDoctors nolonger need to engage in the lengthyprocess of manually reading imagesone by one to identify high risk cases,while coronavirus-probable patientswait around the hospital posing asevere risk of infecting other patientsand hospital staf.\u201dIt is still too early to tell if\u2014andto what extent\u2014AI will have animpact on the COVID-19 outbreak.The numbers of confirmed cases anddeaths rise daily and so too does thesupply of data. One thing is certain,\u201cAI is relevant to this outbreak and inthe future it will become even moreso,\u201d says Moritz. Heymann is moreconservative and remarks that, \u201cAI isone part of the final understanding\u201d.Time will tell.Becky McCallCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s). Published byElsevier Ltd.
