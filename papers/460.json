By contrast, chest radiographs were used These nfidings concur with other reports in smaller frequently in the diagnosis of SARS as both ground-glass cohorts and with our own experience.4-6 Notably, in Shi opacicfiation and consolidation were present early. 10,11 and colleagues' study, the asymptomatic (subclinical) The current literature is partly skewed by the geogroup of patients showed early CT changes, supporting graphical distribution of COVID-19 pneumonia and the what was rfist observed in a familial cluster with COVID-19 preferential use of CT over chest radiograph in China. pneumonia.7 Conversely, other studies have shown This preference might be due to the ease of access to CT positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence in China and the lack of requirement for intravenous of CT changes, or abnormal CT nfidings with initial false- contrast agent for the examination. Therefore, it is unclear negative RT-PCR results.8 As the epidemic evolves, we are whether the threshold for performing CT evaluation starting to observe the varied presentations of COVID-19 of potential lung changes should be lower when chest pneumonia, with symptomatic patients showing con- radiographs are normal.
