This provides strong evidence that such insertionevents can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated frommultiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats andother wildlife species.TextCoronaviruses (CoVs) are common viral respiratory pathogens that primarily cause symptomsin the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In 1960s, two CoVs, 229E and OC43, wereidentified in clinical samples from patients experiencing the common cold3. More recently,four additional human CoVs have been successively identified: severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, NL63 in late 2004, HKU1 in January 2005, andMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. However, only twobetacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are able to cause severe and fatalinfections, leading to 774 and 858 deaths, respectively, suggesting that beta-CoVs may be ofparticular concern to human health. In December 2019, viral pneumonia caused by anunidentified microbial agent was reported, which was soon identified to be a novelcoronavirus4, now termed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy ofViruses5 and HCoV-19 by a group of Chinese scientists6. The number of patients infected withHCoV-19 has increased sharply since January 21, 2020, and as of March 2rd, 2020, more than80,000 confirmed HCoV-19 cases have been reported, with >11,000 severe cases and >2900deaths in China. By the end of January confirmed HCoV-19 cases were present in all the62636465666768697071727374757677787980818283Chinese provinces and municipalities and at the time of writing the virus has been detectedin over 60 countries.An epidemiological survey of several HCoV-19 cases at an early stage of the outbreakrevealed that most had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city prior to illness,where various wild animals were on sale before it was closed on January 1, 2020 due to theoutbreak. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that HCoV-19 is a novel beta-CoV distinct fromSARS-CoV and MERS-CoV1,2,4. To date, the most closely related virus to HCoV-2019 is RaTG13,identified from a Rhinolophus affinis bat sampled in Yunnan province in 20132. This virusshared 96.1% nucleotide identity and 92.9% identity in the S gene, again suggesting that batsplay a key role as coronavirus reservoirs2. Notably, however, two research groups recentlyreported several novel beta-CoVs related to HCoV-19 in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica)that were illegally imported into Guangxi (GX) and Guangdong (GD) provinces, southernChina7,8. Although these pangolins CoVs are more distant to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 acrossthe virus genome as a whole, they are very similar to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain(RBD) of the S protein, including at the amino acid residues thought to mediate binding toACE28. It is therefore possible that pangolins play an important role in the ecology andevolution of CoVs, although whether they act as intermediate hosts for HCoV-19 is currentlyunclear. Indeed, the discovery of viruses in pangolins suggests that there is a wide diversityof CoVs still to be sampled in wildlife, some of which may be directly involved in theemergence of HCoV-19.84858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105Between May and October, 2019, we collected a total of 302 samples from 227 bats fromMengla County, Yunnan Province in southern China (Extended Data Table 1). These batsbelonged to 20 different species, with the majority of samples from Rhinolophus malayanus(n=48, 21.1%), Hipposideros larvatus (n=41, 18.1%) and Rhinolophus stheno (n=39, 17.2%). Thesamples comprised multiple tissues, including patagium (n=219), lung (n=2) and liver (n=3),and feces (n=78). All but three bats were sampled alive and subsequently released. Based onthe bat species primarily identified according to morphological criteria and confirmedthrough DNA barcoding, the 224 tissues and 78 feces were merged into 38 and 18 pools,respectively, with each pool including 1 to 11 samples of the same type (Extended Data Table1). These pooled samples were then used for next generation sequencing (NGS).Using next-generation metagenomic sequencing we successfully obtained 11954 and 64224reads in pool No. 39 (from a total of 78,477,464 clean reads) that mapped to a SARS-like batcoronavirus, Cp/Yunnan20119 (JX993988), and to HCoV-19. From this, we generated twopreliminary consensus sequences. Pool 39 comprised 11 feces from Rhinolophus malayanuscollected between May 6 and July 30, 2019. After a series of verification steps, includingremapping and Sanger sequencing (Extended Data Table 2 and Figures 1-3), one partial (23395bp) and one complete (29671 bp) beta-CoV genome sequences were obtained and termedBetaCoV/Rm/Yunnan/YN01/2019(RmYN01)andBetaCoV/Rm/Yunnan/YN02/2019(RmYN02), respectively. Notably, 20 positions in the RmYN02 genome displayed nucleotidepolymorphisms in the NGS data, although these did not include the S1/S2 cleavage site(Extended Data Figure 3). Only a few reads in the remaining 55 pools could be mapped to106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127the reference CoV genomes. The sequence identity between RmYN01 and Cp/Yunnan2011across the aligned regions was 96.9%, whereas that between RmYN01 and HCoV-19 was only79.7% across the aligned regions and 70.4% in the spike gene.In contrast, RmYN02 was closely related to HCoV-19, exhibiting 93.3% nucleotide sequenceidentity, although it was less similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 (96.1%) across the genome asa whole (Fig. 1a). RmYN02 and HCoV-19 were extremely similar (>96% sequence identity) inmost genomic regions (e.g. 1ab, 3a, E, 6, 7a, N and 10) (Fig. 1a). In particular, RmYN02 was97.2% identical to HCoV-19 in the longest encoding gene region, 1ab (n=21285). However,RmYN02 exhibited far lower sequence identity to HCoV-19 in the S gene (nucleotide 71.8%,amino acid 72.9%), compared to 97.4% amino acid identity between RaTG13 and HCoV-19(Fig. 1a). Strikingly, RmYN02 only possessed 62.4% amino acid identity to HCoV-19 in the RBD,whereas the pangolin beta-CoV from Guangdong had amino acid identity of 97.4%7, and wasthe closest relative of HCoV-19 in this region. A similarity plot estimated using Simplot10 alsorevealed that RmYN02 was more similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 in most genome regions(Fig. 1b). Again, in the RBD, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus shared the highest sequenceidentity to HCoV-19 (Fig. 1c).Results from both homology modelling1, in vitro assays2 and resolved three-dimensionalstructure of the S protein11 have revealed that like SARS-CoV, HCoV-19 could also use ACE2as a cell receptor. We analyzed the RBD of RmYN02, RaTG13, and the two pangolinbetaCoVs using homology modelling (Fig. 2a-2f and Extended Data Figure 4 for sequence128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149alignment). The amino acid deletions in RmYN02 RBD made two loops near the receptorbinding site that are shorter than those in HCoV-19 RBD (Fig. 2a and 2f). Importantly, theconserved disulfide bond in the external subdomain of SARS-CoV (PDB: 2DD8)12, HCoV-19(PDB: 6LZG), RaTG13 (Fig. 2b), pangolin/MP789/2019 (Fig. 2c) and pangolin/GX/P5L/2017(Fig. 2d) was missing in RmYN02 (Fig. 2f). We speculate that these deletions may causeconformational variations and consequently reduce the binding of RmYN02 RBD with ACE2or even cause non-binding. It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions,including RmYN02, ZXC21 and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor. In contrast, RaTG13(Fig. 2b), pangolin/ MP789/2019 (Fig. 2c) and pangolin/P5L/2017 (Fig. 2d) did not have thedeletions, and had similar conformations at their external domains, indicating that they mayalso use ACE2 as cell receptor although, with the exception of pangolin/MP789/2019 (seebelow), all exhibited amino acid variation to HCoV-19. Indeed, the pangolin/MP789/2019virus showed highly structural homology with HCoV-19 (Fig. 2e).Six amino acid residues at the RBD (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505) have beenreported to be major determinants of efficient receptor binding of HCoV-19 to ACE213. Asnoted above, and consistent with the homology modelling, pangolin/MP789/2019 possessedthe identical amino acid residues to HCoV-19 at all six positions7. In contrast, both RaTG13,RmYN02 and RmYN01 possessed the same amino acid residue as HCoV-19 at only one ofthe six positions each (RaTG13, L455; RmYN02, Y505; RmYN01, Y505) (Fig. 2g), despiteRaTG13 being the closest relative in the spike protein. Such an evolutionary pattern isindicative of a complex combination of recombination and natural selection7,14.The S protein of CoVs is functionally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S215 in a similar mannerto the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The insertion of polybasicamino acids at the cleavage site in the HAs of some AIV subtypes is associated with enhancedpathogenicity16,17. Notably, HCoV-19 is characterized by a four-amino-acid-insertion at thejunction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs18. This insertion, whichrepresents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to HCoV-19 and is present in allHCoV19 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 inRmYN02 (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Figure 2) is therefore of major importance. Although theinserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and henceare indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats)strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely acquired by recombination.As such, these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of HCoV-19.We next performed a phylogenetic analysis of RmYN02, RaTG13, HCoV-19 and the pangolinbeta-CoVs. Consistent with a previous research7, the pangolin beta-CoVs formed twowellsupported sub-lineages, representing animal seized by anti-smuggling authorities in Guangxi(Pangolin-CoV/GX) and Guangdong (Pangolin-CoV/GD) provinces (Fig. 3a and ExtendedData Figure 5). However, whether pangolins are natural reservoirs for these viruses, or theyacquired these viruses independently from bats or other wildlife, requires further sampling7.More notable was that RmYN02 was the closest relative of HCoV-19 in most of the virusgenome, although these two viruses were still separated from each other by a relatively long172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193branch length (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Figure 5). In the spike gene tree, HCoV-19 clusteredwith RaTG13 and was distant from RmYN02, suggesting that the latter virus has experiencedrecombination in this gene (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figure 6). In phylogeny of the RBD,HCoV-19 was most closely related to pangolin-CoV/GD, with the bat viruses falling in moredivergent positions, again indicative of recombination (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figure 7).Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene,which is often used in the phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses, revealed that RmYN02,RaTG13 and HCoV-19 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses(Fig. 3d and Extended Data Figure 8).We confirmed the bat host of RmYN02, Rhinolophus malayanus, by analyzing the sequenceof the cytochrome b (Cytb) gene from the next generation sequencing data; this revealed 100%sequence identity to a Rhinolophus malayanus isolate (GenBank accession MK900703). BothRhinolophus malayanus and Rhinolophus affinis are widely distributed in southwest Chinaand southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over long distances and are highlygregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, which might facilitate theexchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of recombination. Notably, RaTG13was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was identified from feces, which is a simple, butfeasible way for bats to spread the virus to other animals, especially species that can utilizecave environments.Based on the currently available data we propose that HCoV-19 likely originates from multiple194195196197198199200201202203204205206207208209210211212213214123456naturally occurring recombination events in wildlife. A virus from bats likely provides thegenetic backbone of HCoV-19, with further recombination events with bats and perhapsother wildlife species resulting in the acquisition of the Spike protein, RBD and the polybasiccleavage site. Similar recombination events have been also implicated in the origin ofSARSCoV19, although it is clear that a far wider sampling of wildlife will be required to reveal theexact species involved and the exact series of recombination events.Lu, R. et al.

In contrast, RmYN02 was closely related to HCoV-19, exhibiting 93.3% nucleotide sequenceidentity, although it was less similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 (96.1%) across the genome asa whole (Fig. Again, in the RBD, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus shared the highest sequenceidentity to HCoV-19 (Fig. 2a-2f and Extended Data Figure 4 for sequence128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149alignment). It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions,including RmYN02, ZXC21 and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor. The insertion of polybasicamino acids at the cleavage site in the HAs of some AIV subtypes is associated with enhancedpathogenicity16,17. 3c and Extended Data Figure 7).Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene,which is often used in the phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses, revealed that RmYN02,RaTG13 and HCoV-19 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses(Fig. BothRhinolophus malayanus and Rhinolophus affinis are widely distributed in southwest Chinaand southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over long distances and are highlygregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, which might facilitate theexchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of recombination. A virus from bats likely provides thegenetic backbone of HCoV-19, with further recombination events with bats and perhapsother wildlife species resulting in the acquisition of the Spike protein, RBD and the polybasiccleavage site.
