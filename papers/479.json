Written informedconsent was obtained from each enrolled patient.We reviewed clinical records, laboratory nfidings, andchest CT scans for all nine pregnant women. Allinformation was obtained and curated with a customised datacollection form. Two study investigators (JG and XY)independently reviewed the data collection forms to verifydata accuracy.Maternal throat swab samples were collected and testedfor SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) recommended Kit(BioGerm, Shanghai, China), following WHO guidelinesfor qRT-PCR.5\u20137 All samples were processed simultaneouslyat the Department of Clinical Laboratory of ZhongnanHospital and State Key Laboratory of Virology/Institute ofsamples from six of nine patients. All nine women were in thethird trimester. Seven presented with fever without chill.Other symptoms included cough (in four of nine patients),myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two).Fetal distress occurred in two cases. Five of the nine patientshad lymphopenia (<1\u00b70 \u00d7 10\u2079 cells per L). Three patients hadincreased aminotransferase concentrations. None of thepatients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died.Nine livebirths were recorded. No severe neonatal asphyxiawas observed. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of8\u201310 and 5-min Apgar score of 9\u201310. Amniotic uflid, cord blood,neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six of thenine patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all results werenegative.The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnantwomen were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patientswith COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on data from this small groupof patients, there is currently no evidence of vertical transmissionin pregnant women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in thethird trimester.Medical Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, WuhanUniversity. Positive conrfimatory cases of COVID-19 infection were denfied as those with a positive test result fromeither laboratory.Amniotic fluid samples from patients with COVID-19pneumonia were obtained via direct syringe aspirationat the time of delivery. Cord blood and neonatal throatswab samples were collected immediately after deliveryin the operating room. Additionally, breastmilk samplesfrom patients with COVID-19 pneumonia werecollected after their first lactation. Evidence of verticaltransmission was evaluated by testing for the presenceof SARS-CoV-2 in these clinical samples. Samplecollection was successful in six cases (patients 2, 4\u20136, 8,and 9). Among the three patients from whom samplecollection was not successful, patient 1 was diagnosedafter caesarean section, thus no sample was obtained.Patients 3 and 7 underwent caesarean section at night,thus immediate sample collection was not possible. Allsamples were processed at the State Key Laboratory ofVirology/Institute of Medical Virology, School of BasicMedical Sciences, Wuhan University, for further testing.Sample collection, processing, and laboratory testingcomplied with WHO guidance.6 All samples, asdescribed above, were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by use ofqRT-PCR with the CDC recommended Kit. The testresults were confirmed by nested RT-PCR with designedprimers. For the nested RT-PCR assay, total RNA wasextracted from samples by use of the TRIzol LS reagent(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by reversetranscription by use of the one-step RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa,Dalian, China). Primers were designed on the basis ofthe sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947).

Both of these patients were ina stable condition during pregnancy. Additionally,one patient was found to have influenza virus infectionSee Online for appendix upon admission to hospital (table 1; appendix).Seven of the nine patients presented with a fever withoutchills, but none had a high fever (body temperature>39\u00b0C). Patients\u2019 body temperatures uflctuated within arange of 36\u00b75\u201338\u00b78\u00b0C. The two patients with a normalbody temperature before caesarean section both hadpostpartum fever (range 37\u00b78\u201339\u00b73\u00b0C). Other symptoms of anupper respiratory tract infection were also observed:four patients had a cough, three had myalgia, two reporteda sore throat, and two indicated malaise. Additionally,one patient showed obvious gastrointestinal symptoms.            Another patient had shortness of breath andpreeclampsia. However, none of the nine patients developedsevere pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation,or died of COVID-19 pneumonia, as of Feb            Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onsetof COVID-19 infection included fetal distress (in two ofnine patients) and premature rupture of the membrane(in two of nine; table 1).All patients were given oxygen support (nasal cannula)and empirical antibiotic treatment. Six patients wereadministered antiviral therapy (table 1).Data from laboratory tests showed that five of thenine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia hadlymphopenia (<1\u00b70 \u00d7 10\u2079 cells per L). Six patients hadelevated concentrations of C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L).Three had increased concentrations of alanineaminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST),one of whom had ALT reaching 2093 U/L and ASTreaching 1263 U/L. Additionally, seven patients had anormal white cell count, with none of the patientshaving a white cell count below the normal range(table 1).All nine patients had a chest CT scan. Eight patientsshowed typical findings of chest CT images\u2014multiplepatchy ground-glass shadows in lungs2 (figure).Nine livebirths were recorded. No fetal death, neonataldeath, or neonatal asphyxia was observed. Four patientshad preterm labour, but all beyond 36 gestational weeks.Two of the four premature neonates at 36 gestationalweeks plus 2 days had a birthweight lower than 2500 g(table 2). Neonate 4 had a birthweight of 1880 g and thepregnancy was complicated by pre-eclampsia. Neonate 7had a birthweight of 2460 g. All nine livebirths had a1-min Apgar score of 8\u20139 and a 5-min Apgar score of9\u201310 (table 2). Neonate 1 had a mild increase in myocardialenzymes on the day of birth (myoglobin 170\u00b78 ng/mLand creatine kinase-myocardial band 8\u00b75 ng/mL), butwithout any clinical symptoms.The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was tested in amnioticulfid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilksamples collected from six patients. Neither the Kitrecommended by CDC nor our in-house nested RT-PCRassays detected SARS-CoV-2 in these samples.            We report clinical data from nine pregnant womenwith laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Theclinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19infection during pregnancy were similar to those ofnon-pregnant adults with COVID-19 infection, aspreviously reported.2 None of the nine patientsdeveloped severe pneumonia or died, as of Feb            BGCHDIadverse outcomes in neonates and fetal infection thatmight be caused by intrauterine vertical transmission.            Pregnant women are particularly susceptible torespiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, becausethey are at an immunosuppressive state, andphysiological adaptive changes during pregnancy (eg, diaphragmelevation, increased oxygen consumption, and oedema ofrespiratory tract mucosa) can render them intolerantto hypoxia. For example, the 1918 influenza pandemiccaused a mortality rate of 2\u00b76% in the overall population,but 37% among pregnant women.8 Pregnant womenwere reported to be at an increased risk of complicationsfrom the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection,and were more than four times more likely to be admittedto hospital than the general population (relative risk 4\u00b73[95% CI 2\u00b73\u20137\u00b78]).9 Wong and colleagues10 also reportedthat around 50% of pregnant women who developedSARS were admitted to the intensive care unit, around33% of pregnant women with SARS required mechanicalventilation, and the mortality rate was as high as25% for these women. In the current study, we treatednine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in11 days from Jan 20 to Jan 3            According to our study, pregnant women withCOVID-19 pneumonia showed a similar pattern ofclinical characteristics to non-pregnant adult patients, asrecently reported.2,15 Common symptoms at the onset ofCOVID-19 pneumonia for these women included afever and cough, whereas less common symptoms weremyalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhoea, and shortness ofbreath. Laboratory tests indicated that lymphopenia isalso likely to occur. Additionally, increased concentrationsE39 weeks, \u00b7\u00b74 days3530NoNo8, 10NoNoNo\u00b7\u00b72 (22%)4 (44%)\u00b7\u00b7000of ALT or AST might be one of the clinical manifestations.However, none of these symptoms was present in everypatient, nor were the symptoms specific to pregnantwomen with COVID-19 pneumonia. By contrast, chestCT might have a high diagnostic value because of itstypical images of virus infection, high accuracy with alow false negative rate, and time eficiency. Therefore, werecommend that, in addition to using nucleic acid testsas the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19pneumonia, relevant clinical examinations are done,including blood counts and chest CT and a comprehensiveevaluation of a patient\u2019s medical history, epidemiologicalexposure, and symptoms.All nine pregnant women in this study underwent acaesarean section. Indications for a caesarean sectionincluded severe pre-eclampsia, a history of caesareansections, and fetal distress. Importantly, uncertaintyabout the risk of intrapartum mother-to-childtransmission by vaginal delivery was another reason forcarrying out caesarean sections. Four of the nine patientshad preterm labour. However, the causes of prematurebirth were not related to COVID-19 pneumonia:one patient had severe pre-eclampsia, one had a historyof two stillbirths, one had a history of two caesareansections and irregular contractions; and one hadpremature rupture of the membrane for about 12 h andsuspected intrauterine infection. Moreover, one neonatein our study had a birthweight of 1880 g at 36 gestationalweeks plus 2 days, and this case was complicated bypreeclampsia. Furthermore, the time period from onset ofCOVID-19 pneumonia to admission was only 3 daysfor this patient; therefore we reasoned that the fetalintrauterine growth restriction was more likely to be asymptom associated with pre-eclampsia. Importantly, allnine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8\u20139 and 5-minApgar score of 9\u201310. One infant had a mild increasein myocardial enzymes on the day of birth, but withoutany clinical symptoms. None of the neonates neededspecial paediatric treatment.The main focus of this study was to investigate thepossibility of intrauterine transmission of COVID-19infection. We chose to test amniotic fluid, cord blood,and neonatal throat swab samples at birth to ascertainthe possibility of intrauterine fetal infection. Notably, allthe samples tested in our study were collected in theoperating room at the time of the caesarean section, thusguaranteeing that the samples were not contaminatedand best represented fetal intrauterine conditions. Ourresults show that SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all of theabove samples, suggesting that no intrauterine fetalinfections occurred as a result of COVID-19 infectionduring a late stage of pregnancy. Our findings are inaccordance with what was observed in SARS, which hasa similar sequence to SARS-CoV-2.14 Previous studieshave already shown no evidence of perinatal SARSinfection among infants born to mothers who developedSARS infection during pregnancy.10,16However, our observation of no fetal infection causedby intrauterine vertical transmission could be afected byour small sample size and the stage of pregnancy at theonset of COVID-19 infection. All patients in the studywere recruited in their third trimester, so we were unableto ascertain the possibility of intrauterine verticaltransmission during the first or second trimester. For example,rubella infection in the first trimester can afect morethan 50% of fetuses via intrauterine infection, whereasby the end of the second trimester the incidence rate isreduced by half.17We did not collect samples of vaginal mucosa orshedding in birth canals, which prevented us fromanalysing whether COVID-19 could be transmitted duringvaginal delivery. Notably, however, our results showedthat breastmilk samples from mothers with COVID-19infection appeared to be free from SARS-CoV-2.            On Feb            This study is limited by the small sample size andretrospective method. Several considerations should betaken into account when interpreting the findings. First,all enrolled patients were in the third trimester. Theefect of COVID-19 infection on the fetus in the first orsecond trimester of pregnancy remains to be clarified.Second, whether vaginal delivery increases the risk ofmother-to-child intrapartum transmission, and whetheruterine contraction could increase the possibility of thevirus ascending, needs to be further investigated. Third,the risk of infection in pregnant women and the efectsof the time or mode of delivery on pregnancy outcomeswere not evaluated. Fourth, whether COVID-19 coulddamage the placenta, which represents an importantlink in vertical transmission, also needs to be furtherinvestigated. Future investigations of these issues andfollow-up studies of pregnant women with COVID-19infection, as well as neonates, will be necessary toascertain the safety and health of mothers and babiesexposed to SARS-CoV-2.In summary, the symptoms of pregnant women withCOVID-19 pneumonia were diverse, with the mainsymptoms being fever and cough. We found no evidence forvertical transmission in late pregnancy. Consideringthe signicfiance of this ongoing global public healthemergency, although our conclusions are limited by thesmall sample size, we believe that the nfidings reportedhere are important for understanding the clinicalcharacteristics and vertical transmission potential of COVID-19infection in pregnant women.ContributorsYZ, WH, and HY made substantial contributions to the study conceptand design.
