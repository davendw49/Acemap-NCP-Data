China, which had initiated the largest community containment effort in history, has been successful at containing the outbreak, and since mid-February the daily number of new COVID19 cases has been declining in China.2 In the Republic of Korea (ROK) with one of the highest number of infections outside China, the outbreak also appears to have stabilized after application of rigorous measures such as strict contact tracing and large-scale quarantine. Singapore, a city-state and global travel hub in Southeast Asia, was one of the first countries to be affected by COVID-19, and for a while was the country with the highest COVID-19 numbers outside of China from Feb 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020. This was in part due to Singapore's strategy of using a comprehensive surveillance system to detect as many cases as possible, and to contain them at the individual level. Despite early importations resulting in local chains of transmission, the rise in the number of cases has been steady without the exponential growth observed elsewhere. This suggests that this strategy, coupled with community-based measures proportionate to the transmission risk, has been effective in containing spread, and could be considered in countries in the early stages of the outbreak where it is not possible to mount massive community-wide containment efforts.", "text": "One of the lessons learnt from SARS is that clear leadership and direction is critical to ensurecoordinated response across all sectors. Therefore, a Multi-Ministry Task Force was set up beforeSingapore had its first COVID-19 case to provide central coordination for a Whole-of-Governmenthandling of the crisis.Singapore\u2019s surveillance for COVID-19 aimed to identify as many cases as possible usingcomplementary detection methods. First, a case definition to identify suspect cases, at healthcarefacilities or through contact tracing, was established based on clinical and epidemiological criteria,and evolved over time as more information became available. To identify cases in the communitythat do not fulfill the case definition, an enhanced surveillance system was set up to detectCOVID19 among all cases of pneumonia in hospital and primary care, severely-ill patients in hospitalintensive care units and deaths with possible infectious cause, and influenza-like illness (ILI) insentinel primary care clinics. Finally, doctors were also allowed to test patients whom they viewedwith suspicion for clinical or epidemiological reasons. To support the surveillance system,SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR laboratory testing capacity was scaled up rapidly to all public hospitals in Singapore, and isable to handle 2,200 tests a day for a population of 5.7m. Similarly, ROK has also quickly expandedtesting capacities, including setting up drive-through testing stations, and has conducted over200,000 tests to date.3All suspected and confirmed cases were immediately isolated in hospital to prevent onwardtransmission. Contact tracing was also initiated to determine their movement history 14 days priorto symptom onset to isolation to determine possible sources of infection and also to prevent onwardtransmission among close contacts. Any contact with current or recent symptoms after exposure tothe case was referred to hospitals for isolation and testing as part of active case finding. Closecontacts who were well were placed under mandatory quarantine for 14 days from their last date ofexposure, while other lower-risk contacts were put on phone surveillance.          As of Mar          A network of more than 800 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) was activated to enhancemanagement of respiratory infections in the primary care setting, with subsidies extended toSingapore residents to incentivize them to seek care at these PHPCs. As early COVID-19 disease ismild and undifferentiated, medical practitioners were instructed to provide extended medical leaveof up to five days for patients with respiratory symptoms. This allowed possible COVID-19 cases toself-isolate at home to reduce the number of undetected cases seeding community transmission.Those with persistent or worsening symptoms are advised to return to the same doctor forevaluation and referral for testing.At the hospitals, infection control measures were strengthened, including strict visitor controls,cohorting of patients with pneumonia or respiratory infection, and maintenance of strict infectioncontrol practices across all settings with personal protective equipment levels appropriate for thepatient care setting. Movement of patients and doctors between healthcare institutions was alsolimited to prevent multiple institutions from being affected at the same time.          Apart from detecting cases and containing spread, prevention of imported cases is important toreduce the force of infection from external sources. In Singapore, temperature and health screeningof incoming travelers from Wuhan since Jan                    Singapore has, as of Mar          The community-level approach in Singapore was focused on social responsibility while life continuedas usual with precautions. Public education is a key strategy to empower the public, and is donethrough traditional print and broadcast media, as well as social media. This includes messages onregular handwashing and seeking medical treatment early and staying at home when unwell. Theuse of masks was only encouraged for ill persons to prevent them from infecting others, and thegovernment distributed four masks to every household. Detailed anonymised information onCOVID19 cases is shared publicly to prevent speculation, while misinformation is quickly debunked andclarified on a government website.In the workplace, employees are encouraged to monitor their temperature and health regularly, andinstitutions to step up their business continuity plans, including allowing employees to telecommutewhere possible and having segregated teams. Advisories to avoid large-scale events of more than1,000 people are in place, while ongoing events are advised to take precautions such as healthscreening and turning away ill individuals. Schools have remained open, and have implementedprecautionary measures such as reduction of mass assemblies, inter-class and inter-school activities,and staggered meal times. Mass fever screening through thermal temperature scanners is widelyinstituted at entry to public buildings, such as offices, hotels, community centres and places ofworship.Although these precautions are implemented, relative normalcy of day-to-day life has beenmaintained in Singapore. Notably, Singapore has not implemented school closures or other majorsocial distancing measures, as there is no evidence of widespread community transmission, andrates of COVID-19 infection among children remain low.4 School closures and social distancing havebeen performed in China and Hong Kong, where containment is also successful. However,Singapore\u2019s experience suggests it is possible to avoid major social disruptions and contain thespread of COVID-19, as a sustainable approach over the long term.With the combination of measures, Singapore has been able to interrupt transmission to contain theoutbreak. The majority of cases were detected through application of the case definition at the pointof medical consult or through contact tracing.5 Statistical modeling of the effective reproductionnumber has shown it to be consistently below 1, suggesting that containment efforts are successful(Pung et al, unpublished data).However, several challenges lie ahead. Firstly, the longer the outbreak persists, the more chains ofcommunity transmission and missed cases are present, and the more difficult it will be to link casesand contain spread. Contact tracing and quarantine are resource-intensive activities and may not besustainable in the long run. Secondly, some individuals who continue to work or attend socialfunctions while symptomatic are driving disease spread, leading to substantial communitytransmission. Thirdly, with global spread, the force of infection from imported cases will besubstantial, leading to new waves of infection.As Singapore is a travel hub with high reliance on trade, sustained border control measures may notbe practical with global disease spread, and it may not be feasible to completely shut a country\u2019sborders for a prolonged duration. These factors may result in a rise in cases, and additionalmeasures will be required to achieve a balance between containing disease spread and reducing theoverall health and socioeconomic impact due to community transmission.Early detection of cases through surveillance and aggressive contact tracing around known cases hashelped to contain spread of the outbreak in Singapore.
