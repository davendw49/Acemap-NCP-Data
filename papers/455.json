The epidemic SNiantgioapnoalreU,nSiivnegrasiptoyroef,trajectory looks diferent. The SARS epidemic in 2003 Singapore (V J Lee PhD)reported 8098 cases with 774 deaths, and was eventually Correspondence to:brought under control by July, 2003, in a matter of Prof Annelies Wilder-Smith,8 months. Although 26 countries reported cases, the vast London School of Hygiene andomrarjoegriitoynso:f Cchaisneas, wTaeirweanco, nHceonntgraKteodngi,nSfivinegacopuornet,riaensd LaTornonnpdeioclianelsWM.wCei1dldEicei7rnH-esT,m, UitKh@lshtm.ac.uk        In November, 2002, the severe acute respiratory syn\u00addrome coronavirus (SARS\u00ad CoV) emerged in Chinacausing global anxiety as the outbreak rapidly spread,and by July, 2003, had resulted in over 8000 cases in 26countries. In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus,named SARS\u00ad CoV\u00ad 2, emerged in Wuhan, China, and ledto a rapidly spreading outbreak of coronavirus disease2019 (COVID\u00ad 19). By Jan        Toronto, Canada. SARS was eventually contained bymeans of syndromic surveillance, prompt isolation ofpatients, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts,and in some areas community\u00ad level quarantine. Byinterrupting all human\u00ad to\u00ad human transmission, SARSwas efectively eradicated. B y contrast, by Feb 28, 2020,within a matter of 2 months since the beginning of theoutbreak, more than 82 000 confirmed cases of COVID \u00ad 19have been reported with more than 2800 deaths, mostlyin China. Outside of China, 46 countries are reportingmore than 3600 cases including at least 700 on severalcruise ships.Traditional public health measures were widely used toeradicate SARS. Can COVID\u00ad 19 be controlled by thesesame measures? It is crucial to remember what measureswere taken, and which lessons could be applicable toCOVID\u00ad 19.In the absence of vaccines and specicfi treatment, the onlyavailable public health tools to control person\u00ad to\u00ad persontransmittable diseases are isolation and quarantine, socialdistancing, and community containment measures.10Isolation is the separation of ill people from non\u00adinfected people, and usually occurs in hospital settings,but could also be done at home for mild infections.11 Forisolation to be successful in preventing transmission, casedetection should be early\u2014ie, before the onset of viralshedding or at least before the onset of peak viral shedding.For SARS, viral loads peaked at 6\u201311 days after onset ofillness for nasopharyngeal aspirates, enabling earlyisolation before transmission.12 The number of secondarycases from an infected patient was clearly reduced if theinfected patient was isolated within 4 days after onset ofsymptoms.13 For SARS, a highly sensitive case denfiitionwas used with a focus on fever or respiratory symptoms,and an epidemiological link (contact or travel history). Allsuspected patients were isolated until SARS was ruledout. Implementing optimal isolation by itself wasmodelled to be more cost\u00ad eefctive than implementingsuboptimal isolation and quarantine together.14 Secondaryhousehold transmission was low in Singapore (6\u00b72%),indicative of rapid detection and isolation of patients.Similarly, in Toronto, secondary attack rate in householdswas 10%, with a linear association between secondaryattack rate and the time that the index patient spent athome after symptom onset.15 In Singapore, health\u00ad care\u00adassociated transmission accounted for more than 90% ofall cases.16 Once full measures were in place, almost allpatients were promptly isolated before secondarytransmission had occurred. The outbreak in Singaporewas propagated by vfie superspreading events, 16 includingthree superspreading events as a result of atypical clinicalmanifestations of SARS.17Quarantine involves movement restriction, ideallycombined with medical observation during thequarantine period, of close contacts of infected patientsduring the incubation period.18 The premise forsuccessful quarantine is prompt and comprehensivecontact tracing of each and every confirmed patient.Quarantine can take place at home or in designatedplaces such as hotels, and both of these options wereused during the SARS epidemic. Quarantined contactshad to record their temperatures, and were visited ortelephoned daily by a member of the public health\u00ad careteam. If the contact developed symptoms, they wereinvestigated at a designated health\u00ad care facility. Theprinciple is that if the person under quarantine developedillness, that person would not have any close contacts tospread the disease, efectively reducing the R\u2080 of theoutbreak to less than 1. As an example of the magnitudeof eforts taken, Toronto Public Health investigated2132 potential cases of SARS and identified 23 103 contactsas requiring quarantine.19 Legally enforceable quarantineorders were issued to contacts. Police made spot checksin Hong Kong whereas video cameras were installed atthe home of each contact in Singapore.16,20Once it is no longer feasible to identify all infectiousindividuals and their contacts in the attempt to slow thespread of disease, a possible next step is to applycommunity\u00ad wide containment measures. Community\u00adwide containment is an intervention that is applied to anentire community, city, or region, designed to reducepersonal interactions.10 These interventions range frommeasures to encourage personal responsibility to identifydisease, increase social distancing among communitymembers including cancellation of public gatherings, andnifally implement community quarantine. 11 Enforcementof community\u00ad wide containment measures is far morecomplex than isolation or quarantine because of the largernumber of people involved. China best exempliefid thislarge\u00ad scale quarantine by declaring epidemic zones andplacing people under collective quarantine in villages,cities, or institutions.21 In April 2003, the Chineseauthorities gained full control of all activities to combatSARS, with guidelines and control measures that werenational, unambiguous, rational, and widely followed,under central guidance. The stringent control measuresincluded school closures and closures of all universitiesand public places, as well as the cancellation of the publicholiday in May. Immediately, the R\u2080 decreased greatly andconsistently.22 In May, 2003, China locked down Beijingand closed more than 3500 public places in an eofrt tocurb community spread.Singapore became the so\u00ad called country of thermo\u00admeters: temperature monitoring was made mandatory inschools and temperature screening was instituted at entryto public buildings. Case detection was further improvedby the opening of hundreds of fever clinics and use of themass media to encourage people to check for fever severaltimes a day. Citizens with higher degrees of anxiety, betterknowledge about SARS, and greater risk perceptionsthan average were more likely to take comprehensiveprecautionary measures against the infection.23 InHong Kong, 49% of the patients with SARS were inclinics, hospitals, and elderly or nursing homes. TheAmoy Gardens cluster accounted for another 18\u00b78% ofcases; these aefcted areas were put on communityquarantine.24 Awareness about SARS was very high, andthere was an extraordinarily high willingness (90% ofrespondents in a psychobehavioural study in Singaporeand Hong Kong) to be quarantined if deemed necessary.23There was a strong political will in all aefcted countrieswith a top\u00ad down approach to enforce all public healthmeasures in a short timeframe. In mainland China, thestrong political commitment with a centrally coordinatedresponse was considered the most important factor in thecontrol of SARS.22Hospital\u00ad based measures included isolation roomswith barrier nursing techniques, strict enforcement ofpersonal protective equipment for staf, and restriction ofvisitors and movement of staf. Negative pressure roomswere not used, or only used when available. Infectioncontrol precautions were enhanced in all hospitals, andincluded the provision of separate triage facilities forpatients with fever or respiratory symptoms. In Torontoand Singapore, workers were required to use gloves,gowns, eye protection, and N95 respirators for all contactwith all patients, regardless of whether SARS wassuspected or not.19 To reduce within\u00ad hospital spread,hospitals banned all visitors to patients with SARS excepton compassionate grounds.19 Health\u00ad care workers orvisitors exposed to facilities where SARS transmissionhad occurred were not permitted to enter non\u00ad SARSareas.25 In Singapore, temperature screening wasmandated twice daily for all health\u00ad care workers.26 Health\u00adcare workers who developed a fever had to report to adesignated health\u00ad care facility, and were isolated untilSARS was ruled out. To accommodate the large numberof patients with SARS (both probable and suspect),Beijing rapidly constructed the 1000\u00ad bed Xiaotangshanhospital within a week, which admitted a seventh ofSARS patients in the country within 2 months.Prevention of global spreadFollowing the WHO global alert, and a strongeremergency travel advisory issued by WHO onMarch 15, 2003, almost all countries with imported caseswere able to either prevent any further transmission orkeep the number of additional cases small. Exit screeningvia thermal scanners was done for all departingpassengers at all airports of afected countries. Manycountries also implemented entry screening for allpassengers arriving from afected areas. After all thesemeasures were implemented, new imported cases ofSARS did not trigger new outbreaks as systems were inplace to identify and isolate them early.27 No travel banswere implemented at any time, but travel advisories toavoid non\u00ad essential travel to countries afected by SARSwere issued by several governments. The psychologicalefects of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposedby various national and international authorities, resultedin a major economic loss for the airline industry andworld economy in 2003, far beyond the main areasafected by SARS. 2817 years later, we can draw upon the lessons learnt fromSARS. The global community is much better preparednow, with many capacity\u00ad building initiatives includingthose under the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations(2005). Indeed, the time interval from the rfist casedescription to the virus sequencing and the availability ofdiagnostic assays was much faster for COVID\u00ad 19 than forSARS, and diagnostic tests were available globally within2 weeks of reports of cases from China. Organisationssuch as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network,the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, andthe Global Research Collaboration For Infectious DiseasePreparedness, supported by the WHO Research Blueprintand its Global Coordinating Mechanism, were able toaccelerate the outbreak response and rapidly initiatetechnical platforms for the development of vaccines andtherapeutics.29 Standardised data collection tools weredistributed and used within a matter of weeks, and the rfistclinical trials for therapeutic interventions was initiated inJanuary.30 China has higher medical standards, a bettereducated health\u00ad care workforce, and more technical andscienticfi expertise now than in 2003. China\u2019s currentresponse contains much more transparency and decisiveaction, which was initiated much earlier in the currentoutbreak than in the 2003 outbreak.31        So why have the case numbers of COVID\u00ad 19 alreadysurpassed those of SARS by Jan        There are several explanations. First, the situation isdiferent. Wuhan, the epicentre of COVID \u00ad 19, combinesmultiple elements that make containment challenging.As the largest city (>11 million) in central China, Wuhanis a major transport hub and centre for industry andcommerce, home to the largest train station, biggestairport, and largest deep\u00ad water port in central China.32China\u2019s outward travel has more than doubled in the pastdecade, and its urban population densities possibly eventripled. The proximity of people in residential housing,during commute, and in work environments in amegacity such as Wuhan amplifies person \u00ad to\u00ad persontransmission. The sheer population size is the singlebiggest challenge. Hospitals were initially overwhelmedby the number of patients, and many patients were nothospitalised because of a shortage of hospital beds,thereby contributing to seeding in the community. Anew hospital was built within 10 days. A massive banquetwith 40 000 guests took place just before the lockdown,further exacerbating community spread. Worse, in thedays just before Wuhan was put under lockdown, morethan 5 million people (many of whom might have beenincubating the virus) had travelled out because of theupcoming Spring Festival, thus spreading COVID\u00ad 19 toother provinces in China. The high connectivity ofWuhan to international airports further facilitated rapidspread to cities and countries with high air passengervolumes from China, such as Singapore, Japan, andThailand.33,34A second explanation might be that the infectiousperiod is diferent. Isolation was efective for SARSbecause peak viral shedding occurred after patients werealready quite ill with respiratory symptoms and could beeasily identified. Although asymptomatic or mildlysymptomatic patients have been reported for SARS,35 noknown transmission occurred from these patients. Bycontrast, preliminary evidence from exported COVID\u00ad 19cases suggest that transmission during the early phase ofillness also seems to contribute to overall transmission;36,37therefore, isolation of more severely ill patients at thetime of presentation to health\u00ad care facilities will be toolate. The efectiveness of isolation and contact tracingmethods depends on the proportion of transmission thatoccurs before symptom onset. Pre\u00ad symptomatictransmission will also make temperature screening lessefective. 38A third explanation could be that the transmissibilitymight be higher for COVID\u00ad 19 than for SARS. R\u2080 is acentral concept in infectious disease epidemiology,indicating the risk of an infectious agent with respect to itsepidemic potential. A recent review (published in February,2020) found the average R\u2080 of COVID\u00ad 19 to be 3\u00b728 andmedian R\u2080 to be 2\u00b779, higher than that of SARS, althoughmore accurate estimates can only be ascertained when theepidemic stablises.39 The speed of spread of COVID\u00ad 19\u2014from the rfist documented case in early December, 2019, to80 000 cases by the end of February, 2020, despite massivecontainment eofrts\u2014is certainly much faster than thatreported for SARS between November, 2002, andMarch, 2003, before any forms of containment were eveninstituted. The high attack rates on the cruise shipDiamond Princess in Japan, with more than 700 on boardinfected out of approximately 3700 cruise ship passengersand crew members by Feb 28, 2020, despite public healthmeasures, suggest a very high transmissibility.40A fourth explanation is that the clinical spectrum isdiferent. China\u2019s initial case definition was focused onpneumonia, and initial case fatality rates (CFR) werereported at about 10% on the basis of this narrow casedefinition. 6 However, as the epidemic unfolds, it hasbecome apparent that mild cases are common inCOVID\u00ad 19. Patients with mild disease manifestationswill be missed even if a more sensitive surveillancesystem were in place, and these patients might spreadthe disease silently, similar to influenza. On Feb 18, 2020,the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Preventionpublished their data of the first 72 314 patients including44 672 patients with confirmed COVID \u00ad 19.41 As many as81% of the patients with confirmed COVID \u00ad 19 werereported to have a mild disease or less severe forms ofpneumonia, whereas 13\u00b78% had a severe condition and4\u00b77% were critically ill. The study also noted that nearlyhalf (49%) of the critically ill patients have died. Of thepatients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, whichprovides a captive cohort to study the virus, more than10% were asymptomatic upon diagnosis. EstimatingCFRs remains elusive, as many patients are still in theearly stages of disease, and more fatalities could occurgiven that death seems to occur 2\u20134 weeks after onset ofsymptoms.6,7 The current estimate by the Chinese Centerfor Disease Control and Prevention is a CFR of 2\u00b73%,with increasing CFRs for patients with advanced age orcomorbidities. However, the report also shows that CFRsvary greatly between Wuhan and other provinces inChina; therefore some uncertainty remains aroundCFRs. With already more than 3600 cases imported intoor acquired in other countries (or on cruise ships), moreinformation on the full spectrum of disease and a betterestimate of the CFR should be available in the next fewweeks. Of note is that even if the CFR of COVID\u00ad 19(possibly <2%) is far lower than that of SARS (10%), thisis not reassuring, as a highly transmissible disease withlow CFR will result in many more cases, and thereforealso ultimately more deaths than SARS.        A ffi th explanation is that community spread is moreprominent. Whereas SARS was mainly an outbreakpropagated within hospitals, widespread communitytransmission is already evident for COVID\u00ad 19. ByFeb 28, 2020, more than 82 000 cases had been reported.Some models indicate that several hundred thousandinfections might already exist in China. Consequently,there will be more unknown contacts than known contactsin the community, which means that many contacts whowill subsequently develop an infection are not quarantinedand under proper medical observation. Hence, Chinadecided to enforce the most drastic of all classic publichealth measures: community containment with socialdistancing, community use of facemasks, and a lockdownof Wuhan\u2019s public transportation, including buses, trains,ferries, and airport. As the community\u00ad based outbreakspread, the lockdown was extended to more than 60 millionresidents in more than 20 cities by Jan        The gigantic eforts come at a cost to travel and trade, toChina\u2019s economy and beyond, let alone the mental healthof millions of people under lockdown. These sacrificesare being made because the memories of SARS fuelhope that containment is feasible. Whether theserigorous measures will indeed result in the same successas for SARS depends on the extent of transmissibility ofsubclinical cases (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic),including the timing of peak viral shedding during thecourse of disease, as well as on the role of fomites andother environmental contamination in propagatingtransmission.The answers to these questions will determine thesuccess. Until those answers are known, the political andmedical community needs to persist with containmenteofrts with the tools that are available at hand for the timebeing. China should be commended for its political will inimplementing what might appear to be extreme measures.Undoubtedly, no other country could enact what China iscurrently doing. The daily decline in new cases by mid\u00adFebruary suggests that China is on the right path, showingthat containment could be feasible. Other countriesshould be aware and reduce the spread of COVID\u00ad 19.What is already known is that exportations to othercountries need not result in rapid large\u00ad scale outbreaks, ifthe countries have the political will to rapidly implementearly case detection, prompt isolation of ill people,comprehensive contact tracing, and immediate quarantineof all contacts. If this approach is not feasible because ofwidespread community transmission, then communityquarantine is also needed with rigorous implementationof social distancing.Containment of COVID\u00ad 19 should remain the focus atthe moment. The short\u00ad term cost of containment will befar lower than the long\u00ad term cost of non\u00ad containment.However, closures of institutions and public places, andrestrictions in travel and trade, cannot be maintainedindefinitely. Countries have to face the reality thatindividual\u00ad case containment might not be possible inthe long run, and there might be the need to move fromcontainment to mitigation, balancing the costs andbenefits of public health measures. Even if our publichealth measures are not able to fully contain the spreadof COVID\u00ad 19 because of the virus characteristics, theywill still be efective in delaying the onset of widespreadcommunity transmission, reducing peak incidence andits impact on public services, and decreasing the overallattack rate. In addition, minimising the size of theoutbreak or suppressing its peak can reduce globaldeaths by providing health systems with the opportunityto scale up and respond, and to slow down the globalspread until efective vaccines become available.ContributorsAWS initiated this Personal View and wrote the first draft.

COVID-19 difers from SARS in terms of infectious period, Heidelberg Institute of Globaltransmissibility, clinical severity, and extent of community spread.

Outside of China, 46 countries are reportingmore than 3600 cases including at least 700 on severalcruise ships. Traditional public health measures were widely used toeradicate SARS. To accommodate the large numberof patients with SARS (both probable and suspect),Beijing rapidly constructed the 1000\u00ad bed Xiaotangshanhospital within a week, which admitted a seventh ofSARS patients in the country within 2 months. Manycountries also implemented entry screening for allpassengers arriving from afected areas. 2817 years later, we can draw upon the lessons learnt fromSARS. Wuhan, the epicentre of COVID \u00ad 19, combinesmultiple elements that make containment challenging. Pre\u00ad symptomatictransmission will also make temperature screening lessefective. Patients with mild disease manifestationswill be missed even if a more sensitive surveillancesystem were in place, and these patients might spreadthe disease silently, similar to influenza. With already more than 3600 cases imported intoor acquired in other countries (or on cruise ships), moreinformation on the full spectrum of disease and a betterestimate of the CFR should be available in the next fewweeks. Hence, Chinadecided to enforce the most drastic of all classic publichealth measures: community containment with socialdistancing, community use of facemasks, and a lockdownof Wuhan\u2019s public transportation, including buses, trains,ferries, and airport. As the community\u00ad based outbreakspread, the lockdown was extended to more than 60 millionresidents in more than 20 cities by Jan        The gigantic eforts come at a cost to travel and trade, toChina\u2019s economy and beyond, let alone the mental healthof millions of people under lockdown. These sacrificesare being made because the memories of SARS fuelhope that containment is feasible. Undoubtedly, no other country could enact what China iscurrently doing. Other countriesshould be aware and reduce the spread of COVID\u00ad 19.What is already known is that exportations to othercountries need not result in rapid large\u00ad scale outbreaks, ifthe countries have the political will to rapidly implementearly case detection, prompt isolation of ill people,comprehensive contact tracing, and immediate quarantineof all contacts. However, closures of institutions and public places, andrestrictions in travel and trade, cannot be maintainedindefinitely. ContributorsAWS initiated this Personal View and wrote the first draft.
