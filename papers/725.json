We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most", "text": "effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the curedrate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis inmainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It issuggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemicin other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can\u2019t berelaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriateantiepidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that othercountries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in timequarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.containment strategies; novel coronavirus (COVID-19)In late December, 2019, an atypical pneumonia case, caused by a virus called COVID-19, was firstreported and confirmed in Wuhan, China. Although the initial cases were considered to beassociated with the Huanan Seafood Market, the source of the COVID-19 is still unknown. Theconfirmed cases increased with exponential speed, from 41 on January 10, 2020 to 5,974 onJanuary 28, 2020 in mainland China, far exceeding those of the SARS epidemic in 2003 (see figure1). By February 22(24:00 GMT), 2020, there have been 76,936 cumulative confirmed cases ofCOVID-19 infections in mainland China, including 2,442 cumulative deaths and 22,888cumulative cured cases. 64,084 cumulative confirmed cases were in Wuhan, accounting for 83.3%of the cumulative confirmed cases in mainland China. Equally of concern, a WHO news releasenoted that 1,400 cases were reported in 26 countries outside China, with the Republic of Korea(346), Japan (105) and Singapore (86) ranked as the top 3 (figure 2), while 35 cases were reportedin United States of America1.        The transmissibility of COVID-19 \u2014 or at least its geographical distribution (figure 2) \u2014 seemsto be higher and broader than initially expected (Horton, 2020). Compared to SARS-CoV (9.56%mortality) and MERS-CoV (34.4% mortality), the COVID-19 appears to be less virulent at thispoint except for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (table 1). COVID-19 wasconfirmed as subject to human-to-human transmission and it is very contagious. The basicreproduction number R0 for COVID-19 was estimated by WHO and some research institutes inthe range of 1.4-6.6 (table 2). This value is slightly higher than that of the 2003 SARS epidemic,and much higher than that of influenza and Ebola. The incubation days of COVID-19 in Wuhancity is 5-10 days with a mean of 7 days (Fan et al., 2020). On average, the duration from confirmedstage to cure or death is 10 days in nation-wide reporting according to Guan et al. (                However, the long-term management and control has brought considerable inconvenience to thedaily lives of people. The failure of factories to start on time and run normally after the SpringFestival also had severe effects on Chinese national and global economies. Ayittey et al. (        The traditional infectious disease dynamics susceptible\u2013exposed\u2013infectious\u2013resistant (SEIR)model has been very popular in analyzing and predicting the development of an epidemic (see        Lipsitch et al., 2003; Pastor-Satorras, 2015). SEIR models the flows of people between four states:susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and resistant (R). Each of those variables represents thenumber of people in those groups. Assume that the average number of exposed cases that aregenerated by one infected person of COVID-19 is \u03b2. The parameter \u03b2 is similar to the basicreproduction number which can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generatedby one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. Considering theprotective measures were taken, \u03b2 should be smaller than the basic reproduction number in table2. An individual in the exposed state (type E) will have the probability \u03b4 changes to individuals inthe infected state (type I), and an individual in the infected state (type I) will change to the curestate (type R) with a probability of \u03b3 or to death state (type F) with a probability of \u03b7 per unit time.In contrast to the traditional SEIR model, we propose aquarantine-susceptible-exposed-infectiousresistant (QSEIR) model that considers the unprecedented strict quarantine measures in mainlandChina to resist the epidemic. The parameter, \u03b1(t), was designed to represent the ratio of peoplewho was not restricted to a specific area and had chances to contact with COVID-19 virus duringspecial period. The \u03b1(t) and \u03b2(t) vary according to the strength of the prevention and controlmeasures for the epidemic. To make the model accord with reality, contrast with the standard SEIRmodel, we added two parameters \u0394(t) and \u03b8(t). The \u0394(t) is the ratio of people with vaccination attime t. \u03b8(t) is the natural mortality of the population in a region at time t (figure 3). The value of\u03b4(t) is closely related with the virus incubation and infectious periods and \u03b3(t) is dependent on thetreatment level and patients\u2019 health status. It is assumed that the virus incubation period is 7 daysand the duration from confirmed stage to cure or death is 10 days based on nation-wide information(Guan et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020). The model is an ordinary differential equation model,described by the following equation.dS(t)/dt=-\u03b2(t)*I(t)*S(t) /NdE(t)/dt=\u03b2(t)*S(t)*I(t)/N-\u03b4(t)*E(t-7)dI(t)/dt=\u03b4(t)*E(t-7)- \u03b3(t)*I(t-10)- \u03b7(t)*I(t-10)dR(t)/dt=\u03b3(t)*I(t-10)dF(t)/dt=\u03b7(t)*I(t-10)N=\u03b1(t) *(1-\u0394(t)- \u03b8(t)) *PS(t)+E(t)+I(t)+R(t)+F(t) =N(        We obtained the number of COVID-19 cases time series data from January 10 to February 22,2020 for mainland China released by the National Health Commission of China and healthcommissions at the provincial level in China2. Due to limited testing and treatment resources whilefacing a major outbreak with a sudden onset, there was under-screening and under-reporting in theearly stages of the epidemic in its epicenter, Wuhan, and this generated biases in the data duringthe early stages (Cao et al., 2020b). Note that this challenge also existed in SARS and othercoronavirus outbreaks (Hartley and Smith, 2003; Razum and Becher, 2003). After the isolation ofWuhan on January 23, 2020 with the stricter requirements of data statistics and the provision ofdetection levels, the data are more and more reliable.We estimated model parameters reversely with QSEIR model by equations (8)-(12). \u03b2(t), \u03b3(t), \u03b7(t)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)and \u03b4(t) can be calculated (see table 4).I(t+1)-I(t) =\u03b4(t)*E(t-7)-\u03b3(t)*I(t-10)- \u03b7(t)*I(t-10)E(t+1)-E(t)= \u03b2(t)*S(t)*I(t)/N-\u03b4(t)*E(t-7)Note that we found some \u03b4(t) in table 4 was>1, which is obviously incorrect, the reason wasmainly because biases in the data during the early stages (Cao et al., 2020b). We deleted these dataand calculated the average, median and variance of the rest value of the four parameters in firststep. In step 2, we deleted values>1.5 times of the column average. In step 3, we calculated theaverage, median and variance of the rest value of the four parameters (see table 5). With table 5,we set the four parameters belong to the range of their average/median\u00b1variance. The parameter\u03b1(t) was roughly estimated as 1.2-2.0 times of cumulative confirmed cases on February 22, 2020divided by population in mainland China.Then, we set the values of these parameters in their ranges randomly, and input them to QSEIRmodel, we got E(i), I(i), R(i), F(i) at each day i, we used the real data I0, E0, R0 and F0 fromFebruary 13 to February 22 in 2020 to test the accuracy of the simulation by errck with equation(13).(F0(i)-F(i))))/4Set errck= (mean (abs(E0(i)-E(i))) +mean (abs(I0(i)-I(i))) + mean (abs (R0(i)-R(i))) + mean (absIn equation (13), we first calculated the average of the absolute differences between the real dataof E0, I0, R0 and F0 and their simulated value of E, I, R and F of kth simulation, then we addedthe four-average value.5,0000 times simulation were made (figure 4), the result is convergence. The minimum value oferrck is 20.42% (figure 4), and the estimated values of the five parameters in this case were listedin the last row of table 5. They were applied in the long-term simulation. The minimum value oferrck is 20.42%, with the current published data that was available, we can use these parametersthat can make QSEIR model results with about 80% simulation accuracy.We set January 23, 2020 as the beginning date of the simulation; the initial values of variableswere set as of this date (table 6). If we set the simulation period D as 300 days, input the bestparameters we found, with the MATLAB program of QSEIR model, we can present the resultsshown in figure 5. The results showed that with 80% probability, the peak value of I was 58,264on February 13, 2020. After June 19, 2020, the value of I would be < 50 and from July 29, 2020,the number would be smaller than 5. By August 26, 2020, I would be smaller than 1, implying thatthe COVID-19 would essentially end. From March 17, 2020, E would be < 5 and, a week later onMarch 24, the number of E would be < 1, which means the epidemic would be totally controlledsince this day, no new infected people would appear. The cumulative confirmed cases ofCOVID19 in mainland China was estimated to be 97,653, and the cumulative number of deaths was(13)estimated to be 8,754.Considering there have 20% estimation error of errc, the peak value of I would be in the range of[52,438, 64,090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19,period between March18-30, 2020 the epidemic would be totally controlled.        Yan et al. (        Furthermore, the existing studies seldom provided estimates of the duration of the epidemic andeffects of different containment strategies in mainland China. At the regional level, Wu et al.(2020b) concluded that in Guangdong province, the epidemic would be totally controlled by midto late March, 2020. The cumulative confirmed cases in Guangdong was ranked second amongprovinces in China. The number was 1,342 on February 22, 2020, which accounted for 1.74% ofthe cumulative confirmed cases in mainland China. The date on which no new exposed casesshould be similar with that of mainland China. The result of Wu et al. (2020b) is correspondencewith our result.        Yang et al. (        How would E, I, R, F change if the value of parameters (\u03b1(t), \u03b2(t), \u03b7(t), \u03b4(t), \u03b3(t)) varied or if thebeginning date January 23, 2020 of the simulation changed? We conducted sensitivity analyses ofthem in terms of their impacts on the I index one by one.Figures 6-7 and tables 7-8 showed that the larger the value of \u03b2(t) or \u03b4(t), the higher the peak valueof the I index and the earlier the peak time. With the increase of \u03b2(t) or \u03b4(t), their sensitivecoefficient to I index decreased progressively. The sensitivity coefficient of \u03b1(t) to I index was thebiggest. When \u03b1(t) increased 0.001%, 8,596 more confirmed cases will be observed (figure 10 andtable 11). These results indicated that quarantine measures (or with vaccination that is not yetavailable) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic. Figures 8-9 andtables 9-10 showed that the greater the value of \u03b3(t) or \u03b7(t), the smaller the peak value of the Iindex. The peak date of I was not very sensitive to the change of \u03b3(t). When \u03b3(t) increased 1%,confirmed cases will be decrease between 4,395 and 7,432. When \u03b7(t) decreased 1%, 4,138 to4,640 additional confirmed cases could be expected. The average absolute sensitive coefficient of\u03b3(t) and \u03b7(t) to I ranked the second and third in those of five parameters (tables 7-11). This showedthat to improve the rate of cure, the development of special medicine should be the second mosteffective measure.If the beginning date of the simulation changed from January 23 to January 30 or February 6in2020 with the value of variables in table 12, together with the same estimated value of parametersin table 5 and, QSEIR program, we can show the main results that started from January 30 in figure11. Compared with the baseline, the peak value of the I index increased 0.9% or 1.5%. The peakdate of I or the ended date of COVID-19 would be 3 days or 1 day ahead (figure 12 and table 12).Results mean that the simulating results were not sensitive to the initial start date. The QSEIRmodel system is stable.Due to the downward pressure on the economy, some enterprises resumed work one after anotherin compliance with the requirements of epidemic prevention and control. Because newly confirmed cases are decreasing day by day since February 17,2020, the outbreak was gradually brought under control, some people began to relax their vigilance. Some began to travel; some went out without masks. If the control measures are slightly relaxed from March 10, \u03b1(t) increased 0.00001 from 0.00006975, which means the number of S increased to 14,000, the end date would be extended from August 26, 2020 to September 14, 2020. And the date that the epidemic can be controlled would be extended 70 days, which would be on June 2nd, 2020. The cumulative confirmed cases would increase from 97,653 to 111,619, up 14.3% (figure 13). Evidence suggests that the colossal public health efforts of the Chinese Government have saved thousands of lives (Editorial, 2020). It indicated that the quarantine measures should not be relaxed before the end of March, 2020 in mainland China.The paper proposed a QSEIR model that considers the unprecedented strict quarantine measureswhich are more fit for the epidemic situation in mainland China. Parameter estimation is the mostcritical part when using this kind of SEIR model to predict the trend of epidemic (Cao et al., 2020b).We estimated the model parameters reversely for the QSEIR model from published informationwith statistical methods and stochastic simulations; from these experiments, we found theparameters that achieved the best simulation test results. The application verified that the methodis effective. The paper not only predicted the peak number and peak date of confirmed cases, butalso provided estimates of the sensitivity of parameters of QSEIR, the duration of the epidemicand effects of different containment strategies at the same time. The long-term simulation resultand sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can beempirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict thedevelopment trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world.In QSEIR model, the parameters are dynamically changing for each day. Parameters estimation isthe most important part in the kind of SEIR model (Cao et al., 2020b). The paper illustrated themethod to generate the parameter estimations. Given data limitation, we estimated a constant valueto each of them with 20% errors in simulation tests, which was the best result in 50000 timesstochastic simulation within their statistical ranges. We applied these values in prediction andobtained better results than existed researches. With the improvement of data quality and moredata, variable parameters can be estimated and the forecasting accuracy of the model could beenhanced.The vaccine research and development cycle are relatively long, from researching products tolarge-scale production and promotion, it takes about 6-18 months. It seems that the COVID-19vaccination cannot be applied in large-scale quantities before the end of August, 20203.However,the COVID-19 is now spreading more seriously in other countries and regions in the world andthere is also the possibility of its returning to China. As of March 7, 2020, 21, 110 confirmed casesof COVID-19 have been reported in 93 countries/territories/ areas. Hence, it is imperative that thedevelopment of vaccines and specific drugs for COVID-19 should be promoted by many countrieswith the technical resources to conduct the necessary high-level research. Until they appear, it isthe most important that appropriate quarantine measures are retained. In mainland China, thequarantine measures should not be relaxed before the end of March, 2020. China can fully resumeproduction with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April, 2020. The results ofthis study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act moredecisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term publicand economic consequences (Editorial, 2020).Liu X L designed the QSEIR model, gave method to estimate parameters, compiled MATLABprogram, got results and wrote the draft of the manuscript. Hewings G suggested to make sensitiveanalysis of parameters and estimate effects of different containment strategies. He edited themanuscript.

China can fully resume production with appropriateantiepidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. Theconfirmed cases increased with exponential speed, from 41 on January 10, 2020 to 5,974 onJanuary 28, 2020 in mainland China, far exceeding those of the SARS epidemic in 2003 (see figure1). Compared to SARS-CoV (9.56%mortality) and MERS-CoV (34.4% mortality), the COVID-19 appears to be less virulent at thispoint except for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions (table 1). COVID-19 wasconfirmed as subject to human-to-human transmission and it is very contagious. However, the long-term management and control has brought considerable inconvenience to thedaily lives of people. The parameter \u03b2 is similar to the basicreproduction number which can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generatedby one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. The minimum value oferrck is 20.42%, with the current published data that was available, we can use these parametersthat can make QSEIR model results with about 80% simulation accuracy. The date on which no new exposed casesshould be similar with that of mainland China. The peakdate of I or the ended date of COVID-19 would be 3 days or 1 day ahead (figure 12 and table 12).Results mean that the simulating results were not sensitive to the initial start date. Because newly confirmed cases are decreasing day by day since February 17,2020, the outbreak was gradually brought under control, some people began to relax their vigilance. The paper proposed a QSEIR model that considers the unprecedented strict quarantine measureswhich are more fit for the epidemic situation in mainland China. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict thedevelopment trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. We applied these values in prediction andobtained better results than existed researches. It seems that the COVID-19vaccination cannot be applied in large-scale quantities before the end of August, 20203.However,the COVID-19 is now spreading more seriously in other countries and regions in the world andthere is also the possibility of its returning to China.
