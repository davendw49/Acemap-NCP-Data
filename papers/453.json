So far, none of the four confirmed patients show signs of severe clinical illness. This case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia. However, it is notable that the infection appears to have been transmitted during the incubation period of the index patient, in whom the illness was brief and nonspecific.3 The fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of 2019-nCoV infection may war-", "text": "Dapaglif lozin in Patients with Heart Failure andReduced Ejection FractionVisit to GermanyAttended businessmeetingsAttended businessmeetingsCCCAttended businessmeetingsCorrespondenceFlight toChinaSymptomsCCCC Contact with Patient 1Positive PCRPositive PCRSymptomsSymptomsSymptomsPositive PCRPositive PCRPositive PCRSymptomsrant a reassessment of transmission dynamics ofthe current outbreak.
