With over 200,000confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discovervaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. Itinitiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via thereceptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD bindingto ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells,presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractivesolution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contactinterface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved ACE2 andSARSCoV-2-RBD co-crystal structure, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) \u03b11 helix isimportant for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, wechemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD \u03b11 helix composed entirely ofproteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of this human derived sequence was complete in1.5 hours and after work up and isolation >20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layerinterferometry revealed that this peptide specifically associates with the SARS-CoV-2-RBD withlow nanomolar affinity.

Similar to the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, SARS-CoV-2causes severe respiratory problems. Coughing, fever, difficulties in breathing and/or shortage ofbreath are the common symptoms. Aged patients with pre-existing medical conditions are at mostrisk with a mortality rate ~1.5% or even higher in some regions. Moreover, human-to-humantransmission can occur rapidly by close contact. To slow this pandemic and treat infected patients,rapid development of specific antiviral drugs is of the highest urgency.The closely-related SARS-CoV coronavirus invades host cells by binding theangiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cell surface through its viral spike protein (S)[14]. It was recently established that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor for host cell entry [5, 6].Recent crystallographic studies of the SARS-CoV-2-S receptor binding domain (RBD) andfulllength human ACE2 receptor revealed key amino acid residues at the contact interface betweenthe two proteins and provide valuable structural information that can be leveraged for thedevelopment of disruptors specific for the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 protein-protein interaction (PPI) [7,8]. Small-molecule inhibitors are often less effective at disrupting extended protein bindinginterfaces [9]. Peptides, on the other hand, offer a synthetically accessible solution to disrupt PPIsby binding at interface regions containing multiple contact \u201chot spots\u201d [10].We hypothesize that disruption of the viral SARS-CoV-2-RBD-host ACE2 interaction withpeptide-based binders will prevent virus entry into human cells, offering a novel opportunity fortherapeutic intervention. Toward this aim, we launched a campaign to rapidly discover peptidebinders to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Analyzing the RBD-ACE2 co-crystal structure, we found thatSARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interface spans a large elongated surface area, as is common for PPIs.7778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101We leveraged molecular dynamic simulations and automated fast-flow peptide synthesis [11] toprepare a 23-mer peptide binder (SBP1) to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, the sequence of which wasderived from the ACE2 \u03b11 helix. Using bio-layer interferometry, we determined that SBP1 bindsSARS-CoV-2-RBD with low nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant, KD = 47 nM). SBP1 is afirst-in-class peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, potentially inhibiting entry of the virus intohuman cells. In addition, the human protein-derived sequence of SBP1 is fully proteinogenic, andis not expected to be immunogenic. Taken together, computational simulations coupled withautomated flow peptide synthesis technology enable an accelerated discovery loop from designto experimental validation, and rapidly delivered SBP1 as a promising pre-clinical drug lead.Antiviral activity studies in mammalian cell cultures are in progress in order to evaluate efficacyof the current and future optimized peptide binders.Using the Amber force field [12], a helical peptide sequence (spike-binding peptide 1,SBP1) derived from the \u03b11 helix of ACE2 peptidase domain (ACE2-PD) in complex withSARSCoV-2-RBD was simulated under TIP3P explicit water conditions. Analyzing the simulationtrajectory after 200 ns, we found that SBP1 remains on the spike RBD protein surface in a stableconformation (Fig. 2B) with overall residue fluctuations smaller than 0.8 nm compared with theirstarting coordinates (Fig. 2A). Per-residue analysis along the 200 ns trajectory showed that themiddle residues of SBP1, a sequence we termed SBP2, have significantly reduced fluctuations(Fig. 2C, 2D), indicating key interactions. The results of this MD simulation suggest that SBP1and SBP2 peptides derived from the ACE-PD \u03b11 helix may alone potentially bind theSARS-CoV2 spike RBD protein with sufficient affinity to disrupt the associated PPI.102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124          The two biotinylated peptides, SBP1 and SBP2, derived from the \u03b11 helix were preparedby automated fast-flow peptide synthesis [          Bio-layer interferometry was employed to measure the affinity of synthesized peptides(e.g., SBP1) to glycosylated SARS-CoV-2-RBD or the human protein menin as a negative control.Biotinylated peptide was immobilized onto streptavidin (SA) biosensors. After fitting theassociation and dissociation curves from serial dilutions of protein, the dissociation constant (KD)of SBP1 to the RBD was determined to be 47 nM with the average Kon = 4.69 \u00d7 104 M-1 s-1 andKoff = 2.2 \u00d7 10-3 s-1 (Fig. 2E). However, SBP2 (a truncate of SBP1) did not associate with the spikeRBD protein (Fig. 2F). SBP1 had no observable binding to the negative control human proteinmenin (Fig. 2G). Together, these data indicate that SBP1 specifically binds SARS-CoV-2-RBDwith low nanomolar affinity.Recently published cryo-EM and co-crystal structures of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 withhuman ACE2 have identified this PPI as key step for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells.Blocking this binding interface represents a highly promising therapeutic strategy, as it couldpotentially hinder SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells and replicating.125126127128129Drugging PPIs is a longstanding challenge in traditional drug discovery and peptide-basedapproaches might help to solve this problem. Small molecule compounds are unlikely to bindlarge protein surfaces that do not have distinct binding pockets. Peptides, on the other hand,display a larger surface area and chemical functionalities that can mimic and disrupt the nativePPI, as is the case for the clinically approved HIV peptide drug Fuzeon [14, 15].The identification of a suitable starting point for drug discovery campaigns can betimeintensive. During a pandemic such as this one, therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. Torapidly identify potential peptide binders to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we used moleculardynamics (MD) simulation on peptides extracted from the human ACE2 sequence. The startingpoint of the binding simulations was the cryo-electron microscopy model of SARS-CoV-2 spikeprotein and several peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2-spike binding domain of human ACE2protein. Our MD simulation (200 ns trajectory) indicated that the SBP1 peptide, corresponding tothe N-terminal ACE2 \u03b11 helix, stably bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. The overall peptide fluctuationswere smaller than 0.8 nm from starting coordinates (Fig. 2A). These results indicated the potentialof identifying a SARS-CoV-2-RBD-binding peptide derived from the human ACE2 \u03b11 helix.        A 23-mer peptide sequence (SBP1) was synthesized by automated flow peptide synthesis.The 23 residues selected from the ACE2 \u03b11 helix sequence (IEEQAKTFLDKFNHEAEDLFYQS)showed low fluctuations along the MD simulation trajectory and several important interactionswith the spike protein were observed consistently with multiple lines of published data [8, 16]. Wedecided to use this peptide (SBP1) as an experimental starting point for the development of aSARS-CoV-2 spike protein binder. Our rapid automated flow peptide synthesizer [        The interaction between SBP1 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was validatedby bio-layer interferometry. The KD, derived from protein association and dissociation kinetics,was found to be 47 nM after averaging the fitting values at different protein concentrations (Fig.2E). This binding affinity is comparable with that of full length ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2-RBD(14.7 nM) [7]. Excess of SBP1 therefore, could potentially cover spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2surface and outcompete the binding for ACE2. Further optimization of the sequence length andamino acid composition are in progress, in order produce binders with higher PPI inhibitory activity.SBP1 is a \u201cfully human,\u201d endogenous peptide and therefore likely to be well tolerated bythe human immune system. The amino acid sequence of SBP1 is entirely derived from humanACE2 and should be recognized as endogenous by the human immune system. This featurecould be highly beneficial in later stages of pre-clinical development. Challenges associated withpeptide drugs, such as proteolytic degradation and rapid renal elimination, will be addressed inthe near future by chemical modifications of the sequence.In conclusion, a peptide sequence derived from human ACE2 was found to bind theSARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD with low nanomolar affinity. We believe disruption of theSARSCoV-2-RBD/ACE2 binding interface with high-affinity peptides represents a promising strategy forpreventing virus entry in human cells and paves the way for new COVID-19 treatment anddiagnostic modalities. Upon request, we will make available our peptide binder and all upcomingoptimized variants to research facilities testing and developing potential COVID-19 treatments.Rapid discovery, synthesis, and testing of potential drug leads should help the global scientificand healthcare communities efficiently address the ongoing crisis.173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2-RBD with ACE2-B0AT1 (PDB: 6M17) was chosen as theinitial structure, which was explicitly solvated in an 87 \u00c53 box, to perform a 200 ns moleculardynamical (MD) simulation using NAMD on MIT\u2019s supercomputing clusters (GPU node). Amberforce field was used to model the protein and peptide. The MD simulation system was equilibratedat 300 K for 2 ns. Periodic boundary conditions were used and long-range electrostaticinteractions were calculated with particle mesh Ewald method, with non-bonded cutoff set to 12.0\u00c5. SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Time step is 2 fsand the trajectories were recorded every 10 ps. After simulation production runs, trajectory fileswere loaded into the VMD software for further analysis.SBP1 and SBP2 sequences were synthesized at 90 \u00b0C on Rink Amide-ChemMatrix resin withHATU activation using a fully automatic flow-based peptide synthesizer. Amide bond formationwas performed in 8 seconds, and Fmoc groups were removed in 8 seconds with 40% (v/v)piperidine in DMF. Overall cycle times were about 120 seconds. After completion of fast-flowsynthesis, the resins were washed with DMF (3 x) and then incubated with HATU-activatedbiotinPEG4-propionic acid (CAS# 721431-18-1) at room temperature for 1.0 h for biotinylation on thepeptide N-terminus.After peptide synthesis, the peptidyl resin was rinsed with dichloromethane briefly and then driedin a vacuum chamber overnight. Next day, approximately 5 mL of cleavage solution (94% TFA,1% TIPS, 2.5% EDT, 2.5% water) was added into the syringe containing the resin. The syringewas kept at room temperature for 2 h before injecting the cleavage solution into a 50 mL conical197198199200201tube. Dry-ice cold diethyl ether (~50 mL) was added to the cleavage mixture and the precipitatewas collected by centrifugation and triturated twice with cold diethyl ether (50 mL). Thesupernatant was discarded. Residual ether was allowed to evaporate and the peptide wasdissolved in water with 0.1% TFA for solid-phase extraction.After peptide cleavage, peptide precipitates were dissolved in water with 0.1% TFA. Agilent MegaBE C18 column (Part No: 12256130) was conditioned with 5 mL of 100% acetonitrile with 0.1%TFA, and then equilibrated with 15 mL of water with 0.1% TFA. Peptides were loaded onto thecolumn for binding, followed by washing with 15 mL of water with 0.1% TFA, and finally, elutedwith 5 mL of 30/70 water/acetonitrile (v/v) with 0.1% TFA.Peptides were dissolved in water with 0.1% TFA followed by LC-MS analysis on an Agilent 6550ESI-Q-TOF instrument using an Agilent Jupiter C4 reverse-phase column (2.1 mm \u00d7 150 mm, 5\u03bcm particle size). Mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acidin acetonitrile (solvent B). Linear gradients of 1 to 61% solvent B over 15 minutes (flow rate: 0.5mL/min) were used to acquire LC-MS chromatograms.A ForteBio Octet\u00ae RED96 Bio-Layer Interferometry system (Octet RED96, ForteBio, CA) wasused to characterize the in vitro peptide-protein binding at 30 \u00b0C and 1000 rpm. Briefly,streptavidin (SA) tips were dipped in 200 \u03bcL of biotinylated peptide solution (2.5 \u03bcM in 1x kineticbuffer: 1x PBS with 0.1% BSA and 0.05% tween) for the loading step. The tips loaded with peptidewere then sampled with SARS-CoV-2-RBD or menin protein at various concentrations in 1xkinetic buffer to obtain the association curve. Peptide only was used as reference for backgroundsubtraction. After association, the tips were dipped back into 1x kinetic buffer to obtain the9221222223224225226227228229230231232233dissociation curve.
