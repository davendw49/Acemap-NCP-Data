We aimed to conduct asystematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinicaltraits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic.Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study thatcontained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Tworeviewers independentlyevaluatedeligiblepublications.Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics ofCOVID-19 were included. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]),and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%]of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findingsshowed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%]patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate(CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those fromHubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). Also,CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that ofnon-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).This large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of theCOVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements ofCOVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies.Summary: This systematic review summarizes clinical characteristics of COVID-19from its outbreak to global pandemic. Combining clinical presentations withradiographic findings as well as blood tests may add value in early diagnosis andmanagements of this emerging infection.        IntroductionIn December 2019, a clustering pneumonia of unknown etiology occurred in Wuhan,Hubei Province, China1. The emerging disease has spread rapidly from Wuhan toother parts of China and to other countries2. Through a deep sequencing analysis, thevirus responsible for this epidemic pneumonia has been designated as SARS-CoV-2by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV)3. The emerging diseasecaused by SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO.By March 5, 2020, a total of 80,565 cases in China have been confirmed. OutsideChina, 14,768 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed spanning in 85 countries, andthe numbers are still on the rise4. What\u2019s worse is that a total of 1,716 healthcareworkers in China have been infected, among which 5 have died by February 1        COVID-19 among different studies, partly due to anthropogenic differences inpatients enrolled and differences in sample size across different studies. Notably,variation in reporting descriptive data may lead to the misunderstanding of COVID-9characteristics. In this updated systematic review, hence, we sought to address theheterogeneities among published retrospective studies and to synthesize the availabledata. We expect this critical review will provide insights to understand the clinicalcharacteristics of COVID-19 in a more systematic manner.          Systematic searches were performed via the Medline database (PubMed) and Embasecombining the terms (novel coronavirus OR 2019 novel coronavirus OR 2019-nCoVOR Coronavirus disease 2019 OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2). We also searchedthe database of Chinese Medical Journal full-text database (http://journal.yiigle.com/)for publications in Chinese using the above strategies. Searches were limited topublications from January          Two of the authors (Z. F. and F. Y.) independently screened searching results todetermine inclusion or exclusion of the articles. Disagreements were modulated byconsulting another author as adjudicator (Z. L.).observational studies as long as they contain clinical characteristics of COVID-19associated illness. If the patients came from the same hospital with overlapping cases,we only selected the publication containing greatest number of cases. The followingpublication were excluded: reviews articles, meta-analysis, perspectives, comments,consensus documents, and publications that were in the neither English nor Chinese.Also, publications with highly suspected but not laboratory confirmed cases wereexcluded.All included literatures were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)11.The quality score of the literature ranged from lowest 0 to highest 9. Total qualityscore of 0-3, 4-6, and 7-9 indicated poor, fair, and good studies, respectively.Information on baseline demographic data, medical and exposure history, symptomsand signs, underlying comorbidities, laboratory findings, chest computed tomographic(CT) scans and CFR were recorded. Based on the diagnostic gold standard forCOVID-19 (positive RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2), we synthesized data ondemographic and clinical parameters in an unbiased manner. The proportion of eachparameter was calculated by the following formula: (actual patient counts)/ (totalpatients confirmed using the gold standard) \u00d7 100%. The \u03c72 test was used to comparethe proportions. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18 (IBMGeneral Information on the Systemic Review          A total of 1052 publications were retrieved using the search strategy. Seventy-tworetrospective studies (including 22 case report, 20 case series, 3 case-control and 27cross-sectional studies) that met the inclusion criteria were included in the finalanalysis (Figure 1). Of the selected publications, 51 were written in English while 21were written in Chinese. The general information on eligible publications can befound in Table 1. Ten publications reported COVID-19 cases from outside of China inUSA12, Germany13, South Korea14, Vietnam15 16, Nepal17, Thailand18, Singapore19,Canada20 and Italy21. The remaining cases were from China covering 31 provinces orprovincial-level municipalities. Additionally, nine reports specifically targetedchildren and the remaining focused mainly on adult patients (including 2 on pregnantwomen). Admission time for COVID-19 patients was from December 1          Demographics and epidemiology of Selected PatientsA total of 3,470 COVID-19 patients were included, of which 3,468 confirmed caseswere based on the positive SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assay while two cases25 werediagnosed according to coronavirus antibody detections. The age of the COVID-19patients ranged from 17 days to 92 years old. Male gender accounted for 1822 (52.6%)of the selected patients. Among 1,573 patients who were asked for smoking status,208 (13.2%) were self-reported smokers. Through a synthesized analysis, a total of2182 cases (76.0%) had a history of transmission exposures, i.e., the patients wereeither Wuhan residents or travelled to Wuhan within the past 14 days.Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19The most common symptom of COVID-19 was fever (2878 [83.0%]), followed bycough (2102 [61.0%]), fatigue (942 [37.9%]), sputum production (720 [28.7%]),dyspnea (412 [14.5%]), muscle aches (477 [18.6%]). Less common symptoms wereheadache (318 [11.8]), sore throat (289 [14.0%]), gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia,nausea or vomiting account for 185 [8.9%]) and upper airway symptoms (rhinorrhea,sneeze or nasal congestion account for 162 [7.6%]) and diarrhea (165 [6.1%]) (Figure2). Further analysis showed that only 1522 [63.4%] of the patients had fever as theironset symptom.Of the selected patients, 888 [31.5%] cases co-existed with underlying chronicdisorders, such as hypertension [13.3%], diabetes [7.3%], chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD) [1.4%], cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases[8.3%], malignancy [1.5%], chronic liver disease [2.1%] and chronic kidney disease[0.7%] (See Table 3 for details). Common complications of COVID-19 included acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (136 [8.9%]), shock (29 [2.2%]) and acuterenal failure (30 [2.1%]).Radiological findings revealed that 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormalpresentations on chest CT (Figure 3A), with either bilateral or unilateralground-glass/consolidative pulmonary opacities. Laboratory blood tests showed that1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0 \u00d7 109/L),while 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases presented an increased level of C-reactive protein(CRP) (Figure 3 B-C).Other OutcomesCollectively, a total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU)while the overall CFR was 3.7% (Table 2). Our further analysis showed thatCOVID-19 patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan in particular) suffered from asignificant higher ICU admission rate than that outside of Hubei, China (21.9% vs.2.5%, p<0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 in Hubei province, China wassignificantly higher than that in non-Hubei, China (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).          This review analyzed clinical data on COVID-19 patients enrolled retrospectively inpublished studies. These patients were admitted to hospitals between December 1          Through literature searching and data extraction, we included 3,470 confirmed casesof COVID-19 based on the positive assays of SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR or antibodydetection. The present study showed that the infected patients aged from 17-day to92-year old. A recent report by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention(China CDC) have shown that 86.6% the patients aged 30-79 years5. This studytogether with China CDC report indicated that the general population, regardless ofage, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The general ratio of male to femalegender of the present study (1.10:1) is also similar to China CDC report (1.06:1),indicating that COVID-19 may not have a gender predisposition. Although 13.2% ofthe selected patients had a history of smoking, we could not draw the conclusion thatsmokers are less susceptible to the viral infection than non-smokers, as the patientsincluded in our analysis were from a sample pool that was not representative thegeneral population by smoking status.This systematic review showed that most of the patients (76.0%) had a history ofWuhan-related exposures. This is of great importance for early quarantine for thesubjects with emerging infectious disease when specific treatments are not available.Actually, we have learned from the SARS outbreak 17 years ago that earlyidentification, early isolation and early management would lead to the stop of viraltransmissions fromhuman to human79. Collectively, there were 36%of theCOVID-19 patients absent from fever as the onset symptom. In this case, suchpatients may have been ignored at the early stage if we focused heavily on feverexamination for initial screening. Our composite analysis showed that fever remainsthe most common symptom (83.0%) in patients with COVID-19. However, theproportion of fever is somewhat lower than that of other coronavirus relatedrespiratory illness, such as SARS (100%)80 81 or middle east respiratory syndrome(MERS) (98%)82. Similarly, the accompanied symptoms of dyspnea (14.5%) anddiarrhea (6.1%) are relatively less common in patients with COVID-19 than thoseseen in SARS and MERS52. More importantly, this study revealed an overall CFR of3.7%, which was quite similar to that reported by the WHO official statistics as ofMarch 5, 2020 (CFR 3.7%, 3,015 died of 80,565 cases)4. Nevertheless, the CFR ofCOVID-19 was much lower than that of SARS (9.6%)83 and MERS (37.1%)84. By far,themechanisms underlying the varying symptoms and CFR for these threecoronavirus-infected diseases are not fully understood. One reason may be that therewere still some COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals at the time of themanuscripts submitted, so the outcome (death or recovery) is not known yet.Additionally, we suppose that the varied tropism as well as virulence of these threecoronaviruses may in part account for the discrepancies, which warrants furtherinvestigations.According to the seven version Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of NovelCoronavirus Infection85, typical CT findings of early COVID-19 are characterized bymultiple small patchy shadows and then developed into bilateral pulmonaryground-glass or consolidative opacities. In our summary, most of the patients (88.2%)had abnormal findings in the lungs with chest CT scan. In some early cases ofCOVID-19, clear evidence of pneumonia has been shown on HRCT while X-rayradiographic findings are still normal51. Thus, chest CT scan should be routinelyrecommended for the early identification of COVID-19. Routine blood tests showedthat 62.8% of COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia, of which the level is relativelylower than that of SARS86. Similarly, a large proportion (64.8%) of COVID-19patients had an increase level of CRP. Taken together, a combination of theepidemiologic history with auxiliary examinations, e.g., chest CT scan and blood tests,will improve the diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19.Our further analysis revealed that patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan inparticular) are facing much more severe situations (higher ICU admission rate andCFR) than those diagnosed in other parts of China. Reasons for the tough situationsbeing caught in Hubei province might be as follows. Firstly, the human-to-humantransmission of COVID-19 had not been cutting down at its early stage in Wuhan,Hubei province. Second, when encountering such a large number of infected patients,a limited healthcare workforce in Wuhan could not support to treat all patients at theirmild or moderate stage. This might result in a higher rate of ICU admission or CFR.Since substantial number of patients as well as healthy residents have been kept inlockdown of Wuhan, great efforts are urgently needed to cutdown the virustransmission from COVID-19 patients to local healthy residents.This systematic review has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective nature ofselected literatures, not all clinical characteristics have been well documented. Thishave resulted in an inconsistence of the total numbers of each item being calculated.Second, some of the selected patients may not have discharged before the studieswere finalized. This might have affected the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 to someextents. Third, since the disease is still ongoing, newly published data on COVID-19might not be included at the time of manuscript submission. Nevertheless, we havesummarized the largest number of patients demonstrating the clinical characteristicsof COVID-19 in the present study. Finally, we could not determine the incubationperiods of COVID-19 due to heterogeneity across studies in reporting the timeline ofcases.In summary, COVID-19 represents an emerging acute respiratory infection withvarious clinical presentations that share similarities as well as discrepancies withSARS and MERS. Combining clinical presentations with radiographic findings aswell as blood tests may add value in early diagnosis and managements. Dynamicchanges of clinical features in the course of COVID-19 are needed to be characterizedin future studies. Since specific treatments are not available at the moment, urgentefforts should be taken to explore for this emerging disease.Acknowledgement: We would like to thank Prof. Junfeng (Jim) Zhang from DukeUniversity and Dr. Mei Jiang from Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Health fortheir kind help in refining the manuscripts.Contributors: ZF and FY contributed equally to this work.

Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study thatcontained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics ofCOVID-19 were included. Also,CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that ofnon-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001).This large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of theCOVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements ofCOVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies. Summary: This systematic review summarizes clinical characteristics of COVID-19from its outbreak to global pandemic. Notably,variation in reporting descriptive data may lead to the misunderstanding of COVID-9characteristics. If the patients came from the same hospital with overlapping cases,we only selected the publication containing greatest number of cases. The proportion of eachparameter was calculated by the following formula: (actual patient counts)/ (totalpatients confirmed using the gold standard) \u00d7 100%. Ten publications reported COVID-19 cases from outside of China inUSA12, Germany13, South Korea14, Vietnam15 16, Nepal17, Thailand18, Singapore19,Canada20 and Italy21. The age of the COVID-19patients ranged from 17 days to 92 years old. Further analysis showed that only 1522 [63.4%] of the patients had fever as theironset symptom. Laboratory blood tests showed that1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0 \u00d7 109/L),while 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases presented an increased level of C-reactive protein(CRP) (Figure 3 B-C).Other OutcomesCollectively, a total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU)while the overall CFR was 3.7% (Table 2). This review analyzed clinical data on COVID-19 patients enrolled retrospectively inpublished studies. By far,themechanisms underlying the varying symptoms and CFR for these threecoronavirus-infected diseases are not fully understood. One reason may be that therewere still some COVID-19 patients being treated in hospitals at the time of themanuscripts submitted, so the outcome (death or recovery) is not known yet. Taken together, a combination of theepidemiologic history with auxiliary examinations, e.g., chest CT scan and blood tests,will improve the diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19.Our further analysis revealed that patients admitted in Hubei province (Wuhan inparticular) are facing much more severe situations (higher ICU admission rate andCFR) than those diagnosed in other parts of China. Thishave resulted in an inconsistence of the total numbers of each item being calculated. Combining clinical presentations with radiographic findings aswell as blood tests may add value in early diagnosis and managements.
