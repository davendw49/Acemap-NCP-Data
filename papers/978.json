Their explicit protocols provide a framework for other healthcare and public healthsystems to weigh along with cost-effectiveness and scalability. Both papers highlight the power ofcollaborative partnerships and communication between public health and healthcare facilities requiredin these events.Finally, we must identify our weaknesses and vulnerabilities the \u201cenemy\u201d can exploit. As Sun Tzuexhorted, \u201ccarefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strengthis superabundant and where it is deficient.\u201d1 We want to highlight four critical vulnerabilities at presentwithin the United States context but with global applicability.First, a paramount vulnerability that must be rapidly addressed is the limited diagnostic testing capacityfor SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical arena. At this stage where screening must expand from narrowgeographic-based criteria to syndromic surveillance, rapid and validated testing at scale must beavailable to help inform clinicians and public health officials for isolation, triage and care of patients.Fortunately, FDA Emergency Use Authorization regulatory requirements have been relaxed to allowmore laboratory developed tests to come online even as the CDC races to expand testing capacity in thepublic health sector. These efforts must be given utmost priority to define the scope of currentcommunity transmission and to allow proactive, rather than reactionary, public health responses.Second, aggressive supply chain management during periods of increased demand is critical. Publicpanic and fear can create or exacerbate real supply shortages, especially in an era of social media andjust-in-time supply chain management. The World Health Organization and others have issued helpfulguidance on the rational use of PPE for COVID-19, aimed at optimizing HCW safety while mitigatingdisruptions in the global PPE supply chain.5 Rapid scalability in the supply of pharmaceuticals and PPEmust be considered a public health imperative. Moreover, preventing rushes on the public marketthrough measured risk communication with the public can help safeguard needed supplies. Finally, wemust consider strategies to decrease less urgent use of PPE and identify situations where we can usedifferent types of protection, where elements of PPE can be reused, or where the use of PPE is notsupported by evidence-based practice.Third, efforts to build and leverage margin and flexibility within healthcare staff capacity must beprioritized. Marchand-Senecal et. al. point out that specialized, dedicated teams in an outbreak, whileattractive, could be quickly overwhelmed as cases increase. Moreover, longer shifts and increased workintensity may lead to HCW fatigue and lapses in PPE techniques, driving nosocomial transmission, apainful reminder from the battle with SARS. Initial reports indicate about 4% of Chinese HCW caring forCOVID-19 patients were infected, with 15% classified as severe or critical disease.6 Transmission toHCWs, a feature seen with SARS and MERS, is devastating as it simultaneously diverts resources,depletes HCW capacity, saps morale, and drives public fear. To mitigate this, healthcare systemsexperiencing a surge in cases should consider all measures to liberate resources and staff, includingtelemedicine triage, drive-thru testing, and preparations to reschedule elective medical care.Fourth, and finally, our national and global commitments to funding for public health and epidemicpreparedness must be expanded and sustained. Rather than the current \u201cboom and bust\u201d fundingroller-coaster responsive to the latest outbreak, governments must provide expanded, stable fundinglevels to improve disease surveillance and response and to build technical capacity for rapid deploymentof diagnostics, vaccine development, and clinical trials of pharmaceuticals for this outbreak and thenext.7 The folly of short-sighted cuts to public health and research funding is manifest in the significantcosts associated with a lack of preparedness and threatens global health and security.As the battle against COVID-19 ramps up worldwide, it is imperative that the entire global communityjoin together in solidarity, apply the hard-fought lessons of this and prior epidemics, and move rapidly toimplement proven public health and IPC principles to turn the tide against this foe.
