In the United States, delays in the availability of diagnostic testing have prompted\u00a0 questions about the extent of unobserved community transmission. Using a simulation model\u00a0 informed by reported cases and deaths, we estimated that tens of thousands of people\u00a0 (median: \u200b22,876, 95% posterior predictive interval: 7,451 - 53,044) were infected by the time a\u00a0 national emergency was declared. Our results also indicate that fewer than 10% of locally\u00a0 acquired, symptomatic infections in the US were detected throughout much of late February.\u00a0 These results point to the need for immediate, large-scale efforts to mitigate the impacts of\u00a0 SARS-CoV-2 on the US.\u00a0 \u00a0", "text": "\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus that is causing a global pandemic \u200b(\u200b1\u200b)\u200b. The\u00a0unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 owes to its high transmissibility \u200b(\u200b2\u200b)\u200b, pre-symptomatic\u00a0transmission \u200b(\u200b3\u200b)\u200b, and transmission by asymptomatic infections \u200b(\u200b4\u200b)\u200b. An appreciable fraction of\u00a0infections are asymptomatic \u200b(\u200b5\u200b)\u200b, and many others result in mild symptoms that could be\u00a0mistaken for other respiratory illnesses \u200b(\u200b6\u200b)\u200b. These factors point to a potentially large reservoir of\u00a0unobserved infections \u200b(\u200b7\u200b)\u200b, especially in settings where capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2 has been\u00a0limited \u200b(\u200b8\u200b)\u200b. The United States is one such country in which limited testing has been a major\u00a0concern, particularly as imported cases, and now local cases, have increased over time \u200b(\u200b9\u200b)\u200b. Until\u00a0February 27, testing criteria in the US were limited to close contacts of confirmed cases and\u00a0those with recent travel to China \u200b(\u200b9\u200b)\u200b. This means that any local infections resulting from an\u00a0unobserved imported infection would have gone unnoticed. Community transmission occurred\u00a0without notice while testing was still being rolled out \u200b(\u200b10\u200b, \u200b11\u200b)\u200b, albeit to an unknown extent.\u00a0\u00a0Our goal was to estimate the extent of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the US that\u00a0occurred prior to its widespread recognition. Unlike other countries where testing and\u00a0containment measures were pursued aggressively \u200b(\u200b12\u200b, \u200b13\u200b)\u200b, rollout of testing in the US was slow\u00a0(\u200b9\u200b)\u200b and widespread social-distancing measures did not go into effect until several weeks after\u00a0the first reported case \u200b(\u200b14\u200b, \u200b15\u200b)\u200b. Understanding the extent of community transmission has major\u00a0implications for the effectiveness of different options for control \u200b(\u200b16\u200b)\u200b and for anticipating the\u00a0trajectory and impact of the pandemic \u200b(\u200b17\u200b)\u200b.\u00a0\u00a0To estimate the extent of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the US, we used a\u00a0stochastic simulation model that combined importation and local transmission processes. We\u00a0informed model parameters with estimates from other countries, where available (Table S1),\u00a0and estimated values of two unknown parameters by fitting the model to data on local reported\u00a0deaths in the US \u200b(\u200b18\u200b)\u200b. To model importation, we simulated observed and unobserved imported\u00a0infections based on the number and timing of imported cases reported in the US \u200b(\u200b19\u200b)\u200b and\u00a0assumptions about the proportion of different infection outcomes \u200b(\u200b5\u200b, \u200b20\u200b)\u200b. To model local\u00a0transmission, we used a branching process model informed by estimates of the serial interval\u00a0and reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from Singapore \u200b(\u200b3\u200b)\u200b. Due to aggressive containment\u00a0efforts there \u200b(\u200b12\u200b)\u200b, we considered our model to be a conservative representation of community\u00a0transmission in the US. To relate our model\u2019s predictions to US data on reported cases and\u00a0deaths, we also simulated the timing of symptom onset \u200b(\u200b3\u200b)\u200b, case reporting \u200b(\u200b18\u200b)\u200b, and death \u200b(\u200b21\u200b)\u200b,\u00a0for simulated infections for which those outcomes occurred.\u00a0\u00a0By March 12, there were a total of 1,514 reported cases and 39 reported deaths that resulted\u00a0from local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the US. We used this information to estimate the\u00a0probability of detecting imported symptomatic infections, \u03c1travel , by seeding our model with\u00a0imported infections, simulating local transmission, and comparing simulated and reported local\u00a0deaths. Under our baseline scenario, this resulted in a median estimate of \u03c1travel = 0.39 (95%\u00a0posterior predictive interval: 0.15 - 0.90). \u200bSimulating from January 1, we obtained 22,876 (95%\u00a0PPI: 7,451 - 53,044) local infections cumulatively in the US by March 12 (Fig. 1A). Due to the\u00a0exponential growth posited by our model, 2,958 (95% PPI: 956 - 7,249) local infections were\u00a0predicted to have occurred on March 12 alone (Fig. 1B). Had we performed a simple\u00a0extrapolation of reported cases and deaths based on \u03c1travel , our estimate of cumulative local\u00a0infections by March 12 would have been only 5,018 (95% PPI: 2,350 - 12,445). This suggests\u00a0that detection of local infections was less sensitive than detection of imported infections.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We estimated the probability of detecting local symptomatic infections, \u03c1local , by comparing our\u00a0model\u2019s predictions of symptomatic infections to local case reports on a daily basis. Over the\u00a0course of February, daily estimates of \u03c1local decreased from our uniform prior down to a low of\u00a06.4x10\u200b-3\u200b (95% PPI: 2.4x10\u200b-4\u200b - 4.8x10\u200b-2\u200b) on March 1, as increases in simulated local infections\u00a0outpaced newly reported local cases (Fig. 2B, black). As testing increased in March (Fig. 2B,\u00a0red), so too did reported cases (Fig. 2A, red) and daily estimates of \u03c1local (Fig. 2B, black). By\u00a0March 12, we estimated \u03c1local to be 0.80 (95% PPI: 0.34 - 1.00). Between February 23 (low\u00a0estimate of \u03c1local ) and March 8 (last day of verified testing numbers), our daily estimates of\u00a0\u03c1local were well correlated with daily numbers of tests administered (Pearson\u2019s correlation,\u00a0median: 0.57, 95% PPI: 0.48 - 0.65). Although these results are consistent with the possibility\u00a0that testing might have improved case detection in March, they also indicate that case detection\u00a0was likely very low at times in February when containment might have been feasible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0scale-up of containment efforts. Our estimate that fewer than 10% of local symptomatic\u00a0infections were detected by surveillance for much of February suggests that a crucial\u00a0opportunity to limit the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the US may have been missed. Although the\u00a0number of tests administered increased in March \u200b(\u200b9\u200b)\u200b, so too did the number of infections and,\u00a0consequently, the demand for testing.\u00a0\u00a0Coincident with the March 13 declaration of a national emergency \u200b(\u200b14\u200b)\u200b, social distancing\u00a0measures went into effect across the US \u200b(\u200b15\u200b)\u200b. Our estimate of several thousand active\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 infections at that time suggests that large-scale mitigation efforts, rather than\u00a0reactionary measures \u200b(\u200b28\u200b)\u200b, are necessary. Even if these efforts begin to reverse increases in\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the US, our results show that a downturn in COVID-19 deaths may\u00a0not appear until several weeks later. Analyses of the impact of large-scale mitigation efforts in\u00a0China \u200b(\u200b29\u200b)\u200b provide reason for optimism that they can be effective.\u00a0\u00a0Acknowledgements\u00a0Thanks to Jason Rohr and Moritz Kraemer for feedback on the manuscript.\u00a0References\u00a01.\u00a0 World Health Organization, \u201cCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report\u201d (51,\u00a02020).\u00a019.\u00a0 midas-network, midas-network/COVID-19. \u200bGitHub\u200b, (available at\u00a0https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19\u200b).\u00a0(2020).\u00a0to two publicly available datasets on cases of COVID-19 internationally and in the United States.\u00a0the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Spread (MIDAS) Network \u200b(\u200b1\u200b)\u200b. These data informed the\u00a0number and timing of imported infections predicted by our importation model. We obtained data\u00a0on the total number of US cases and deaths and total number of cases and deaths globally from\u00a0time series compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and\u00a0We removed SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals who were repatriated from the \u200bDiamond Princess\u00a0cruise ship from our analysis, due to the fact that they were quarantined \u200b(\u200b3\u200b)\u200b, leaving 153\u00a0imported cases (including one death). We first estimated the number of imported infections\u00a0based on the probability that an infection would be symptomatic, the probability of an imported\u00a0symptomatic infection being detected, and the probability of death among symptomatic\u00a0infections (case fatality risk, CFR). The CFR and the probability that an infection is symptomatic\u00a0were drawn from beta distributions with parameters given in Table S1, with means of 2.29% and\u00a017.9%, respectively. We jointly estimated the probability of detection of imported symptomatic\u00a0infections, \u03c1travel , and the relative offspring number of asymptomatic infections, \u03b1 , by running\u00a0the importation and branching process models across a range of values of those parameters\u00a0and calculating the probability of observing the number of reported deaths through March 12;\u00a0this approach is described in more detail in the parameter calibration section below. The\u00a0probability of the number of unobserved imported infections being between 0 and 20,000, along\u00a0with the 152 observed cases and 1 observed death, was calculated using a multinomial\u00a0distribution; the number of imported infections was then sampled from that distribution. We\u00a0then \u200bsmoothed the date of known imported infections with a Gaussian kernel and sampled\u00a0dates of all imported infections from that distribution\u200b. As an alternative scenario, we distributed\u00a0the timing of imported infections based on the timing of international incidence, with cases in\u00a0draw of the number and timing of imported infections seeded one simulation of the branching\u00a0process model, to maximally represent uncertainty in both importation and transmission\u00a0processes. The number of secondary infections generated by each infection in the branching\u00a0process model was drawn from a negative binomial offspring distribution with mean \u200bR\u200b and\u00a0dispersion parameter \u200bk\u200b. Under our baseline scenario, we used a dispersion parameter of \u200bk \u200b=\u00a0Under alternative scenarios for \u200bk\u200b, we considered values of 0.15 and 0.30 to account for\u00a0superspreading observed in outbreaks of SARS and MERS \u200b(\u200b4\u200b, \u200b5\u200b)\u200b. The number of secondary\u00a0infections generated by asymptomatic individuals was also drawn from a negative binomial\u00a0distribution, but with mean \u03b1R0 , where \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] . Whether an individual was symptomatic was\u00a0determined by a Bernoulli trial with probability equal to the proportion of infections that were\u00a0asymptomatic in that replicate. Each secondary infection\u2019s exposure time was drawn from a\u00a0log-normal generation interval distribution with mean 4.56 days. In doing so, we assumed that\u00a0the generation interval followed the same distribution as the serial interval.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to exposure, we simulated three additional outcomes, and the timing thereof, in a\u00a0subset of infections.\u00a0\u25cf Symptom onset:\u200b The number of new symptomatic infections on day \u200bt\u200b was drawn from a\u00a0binomial distribution with the number of trials equal to the number of infections with\u00a0time of potential symptom onset on day \u200bt\u200b, and the probability of success\u200b \u200bequal to the\u00a0proportion of infections that are symptomatic. For infections that were simulated to\u00a0result in symptoms, the time of symptom onset was drawn from a Weibull incubation\u00a0period distribution with mean 7.07 \u200b(\u200b6\u200b)\u200b and added to each individual\u2019s exposure time.\u00a0\u25cf Case reporting:\u200b The number of cases reported on day \u200bt\u200b was drawn from a binomial\u00a0distribution with the number of trials equal to the number of infections with time of\u00a0potential case reporting on day \u200bt\u200b, and the probability of success\u200b \u200bequal to the proportion\u00a0of infections that are symptomatic. This accounts for the delay in reporting, but not\u00a0underreporting, which is addressed below when we calculate the probability that a\u00a0symptomatic infection is detected, \u03c1local . The time of potential case reporting was drawn\u00a0from a gamma distribution of the period between symptom onset and case reporting\u00a0with mean 6 days, and added to each infection\u2019s time of symptom onset.\u00a0\u25cf Death:\u200b The number of deaths on day \u200bt\u200b was drawn from a binomial distribution with the\u00a0number of trials equal to the number of infections that could have experienced death on\u00a0day \u200bt\u200b, and the probability of success\u200b \u200bequal to the case fatality risk. The time of death was\u00a0drawn from a log-normal distribution of time from symptom onset to death with mean\u00a014 days \u200b(\u200b7\u200b)\u200b, and added to each individual\u2019s time of symptom onset.\u00a0\u00a0parameter distributions were described in the literature using medians and interval measures of\u00a0spread, we used the optim function in R to estimate parameters of those distributions that\u00a0matched distribution moments reported by those studies. In that sense, all parameters in our\u00a0analysis were treated as random variables, with associated uncertainty accounted for\u00a0throughout our analysis. For the delay between symptom onset and case notification, we fitted\u00a0a gamma distribution to data on the delay between symptoms and reporting for 26 US cases in\u00a0the MIDAS line list data; the gamma distribution fitted the data better than negative binomial or\u00a0log-normal distributions according to AIC (133.5, 134.6, and 134.0, respectively) (Fig. S1). Our\u00a0mean estimate of 6.0 for this delay is in line with previous estimates from China of 5.8 by Li et\u00a0al. \u200b(\u200b8\u200b)\u200b and 5.5 by Bi et al. \u200b(\u200b9\u200b)\u200b. Three key parameters \u2013 \u200bR\u200b, the serial interval, and the incubation\u00a0period \u2013 were taken from a single reference \u200b(\u200b6\u200b)\u200b to ensure that those estimates were consistent\u00a0with each other. That is important because \u200bR\u200b and the serial interval jointly control the epidemic\u00a0growth rate \u200b(\u200b10\u200b)\u200b, so taking estimates of \u200bR\u200b and the serial interval from different studies could\u00a0have led to unrealistic projections of epidemic growth rate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figure S1. Distribution of the delay between symptom onset and reporting for 26 US cases. \u200bThe\u00a0curve shows the maximum-likelihood fit of a gamma distribution (shape = 3.43, rate = 0.572) to\u00a0those data.\u00a0\u00a0We estimated how the probability of detecting locally acquired, symptomatic infections, \u03c1local ,\u00a0changed over time. These estimates were based on the number of symptomatic cases reported\u00a0each day, \u200bC\u200b(\u200bt\u200b), and our model\u2019s predictions for the number of symptomatic infections that could\u00a0have been reported each day, \u200bS\u200b(\u200bt\u200b), after accounting for a delay between symptom onset and\u00a0reporting. We assumed a uniform prior for \u03c1local , and on each day estimated a posterior equal to\u00a0\u03c1local(t) ~ Beta(1 + C(t), 1 + S(t) \u2212 C(t)) .\u00a0\u00a0infections occurring through then, we set R0 = 0 from March 13 onwards and simulated our\u00a0model forward to May 31. This allowed any infections occurring by March 12 enough time to\u00a0result in death, for the proportion expected to result in that outcome.\u00a0\u00a0Due to a lack of prior estimates for two parameters, we jointly estimated the proportion of\u00a0imported symptomatic infections that were detected, \u03c1travel , and the relative infectiousness of\u00a0asymptomatic infections, \u03b1 . We fitted these parameters to the total number of deaths resulting\u00a0from locally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infections in the US by March 12. To approximate a likelihood\u00a0for given values of \u03c1travel and \u03b1 , we simulated 200 replicate time series of imported infections,\u00a0each based on the same value of \u03c1travel , and then simulated local transmission using the same\u00a0value of \u03b1 for each of the 200 replicates. For each of these 200 replicate simulations, we\u00a0calculated the cumulative number of infections, \u200bI\u200bD\u200b, that, based on their timing, could have\u00a0resulted in death by March 12. We then calculated the likelihood of the reported number of\u00a0deaths, \u200bD\u200b, according to a binomial distribution in which \u200bD\u200b is the number of successes among \u200bI\u200bD\u00a0trials that each have probability of success IFR, where IFR is equal to the CFR times one minus\u00a0the probability of being asymptomatic. Each of the 200 replicates used independent draws from\u00a0the uncertainty distributions of other model parameters, so we took the average of the 200\u00a0likelihoods to obtain a single marginal likelihood for a given value of \u03c1travel and \u03b1 . After\u00a0calculating this marginal likelihood across a grid of values between 0 (or 0.01 for \u03c1travel ) and 1\u00a0in increments of 0.05 for each parameter, we smoothed this marginal likelihood surface using\u00a0the bicubic.grid function in the akima package in R to create a gridded marginal likelihood\u00a0surface with a 0.001 x 0.001 mesh. Finally, we drew samples from the posterior probability\u00a0distribution of these parameters by resampling from this smoothed marginal likelihood surface,\u00a0which implicitly assumed a uniform prior on the two parameters. We repeated this calibration\u00a0procedure for each scenario that we explored, obtaining different estimates for \u03c1travel and \u03b1 for\u00a0each of our sensitivity analyses.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the alternative importation models, we also undertook a one-at-a-time sensitivity\u00a0analysis for each parameter shown in Table S1, with the exception of the calibrated parameters\u00a0(the last two rows). These last two parameters were re-calibrated as described in the previous\u00a0section for each new parameter set and importation timing combination. Including the baseline\u00a0scenario, there were a total of 18 scenarios (i.e., the baseline plus two explored values for each\u00a0of seven parameters plus one additional scenario with different importation timing). For some\u00a0parameter values explored in sensitivity analyses, we did not directly use literature estimates,\u00a0but instead chose values which were plausible minima or maxima for that parameter; these are\u00a0indicated by \u201clower\u201d or \u201chigher\u201d in Table S1. For the dispersion parameter, we wanted to explore\u00a0a value that allowed for superspreading but that generated less overdispersion than was\u00a0observed for SARS; this formed our intermediate value in the sensitivity analysis. All baseline\u00a0values were taken directly from literature estimates, with the exception of reporting delay, which\u00a0was calibrated as described in the branching process model section. For that parameter, we\u00a0obtained the low and high scenarios by multiplying the shape parameter by 0.5 and 1.5,\u00a0respectively, while keeping the rate parameter the same. In this way, the reporting delay is the\u00a0sum of one, two, or three identically distributed gamma random variables in the low, baseline,\u00a0and high scenarios, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Table S1.

By jointly estimating \u03c1travel and the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic\u00a0infections, \u03b1 , we obtained a median estimate of 0.39 (95% PPI: 0.15 - 0.90) for \u03c1travel under our\u00a0baseline scenario. This resulted in a median of 452 (95% PPI: 206 - 1068) imported infections.\u00a0international case reports, we estimated \u03c1travel = 1.00 (95% PPI: 0.98 - 1.00) and 187 (95% PPI:\u00a0174 - 202) imported infections. An estimate of \u03c1travel = 1.00 implies that all symptomatic\u00a0imported infections were detected, but it still means that asymptomatic infections would have\u00a0been undetected.\u00a0\u00a0Using our estimate of \u03c1local(t) , we simulated the number of reported cases through time and\u00a0compared this with the actual number of reported cases. By March 12, our model predicted that\u00a0there should have been 1,530 (95% PPI: 475 - 3,496) reported cases, commensurate with the\u00a0actual number of 1,514 reported cases (Fig. S2). As expected, this confirms that our estimates\u00a0of \u03c1local(t) were consistent with the model and the data.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figure S2. The number of cases reported in the US compared to the number our model predicts\u00a0were reported.\u00a0\u00a0Estimates of the proportion of imported symptomatic infections that were detected, \u03c1travel , and\u00a0the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections relative to symptomatic infections, \u03b1 , varied\u00a0based on the values of the other parameters. In general, higher values for parameters expected\u00a0to increase transmission (e.g., \u200bR\u200b) were associated with higher estimates of \u03c1travel (Table S2).\u00a0Compared to a baseline estimate of \u03c1travel = 0.39 (95% PPI: 0.15 - 0.90) with \u200bR\u200b = 1.97, the\u00a0estimate of \u03c1travel was 0.83 (95% PPI: 0.47 - 0.99) with \u200bR\u200b = 2.7 and 0.08 (95% PPI: 0.04 - 0.19)\u00a0with \u200bR\u200b = 1.5. For a shorter serial interval with a mean of 4.7 days, the estimate was \u03c1travel = 0.52\u00a0(95% PPI: 0.19 - 0.96), and with a longer mean serial interval of 7.5 days, the estimate was 0.06\u00a0(95% PPI: 0.03 - 0.14). The estimated value of \u03c1travel was also lower if the CFR was low ( \u03c1travel =\u00a00.20, 95% PPI: 0.08 - 0.53), compared to the scenario with a higher CFR ( \u03c1travel = 0.54, 95% PPI:\u00a00.21 - 0.96). Higher \u03c1travel estimates correspond to fewer undetected imported infections;\u00a0therefore, fewer undetected importations are required to account for the observed number of\u00a0local deaths through March 12 if the CFR is high, \u200bR\u200b is high, or the serial interval is short. In\u00a0addition, when we based the timing of importations on international incidence (excluding China\u00a0after travel restrictions were implemented on February 3) the estimate of \u03c1travel was 1.00 (95%\u00a0infections to increase \u2013 under this scenario.

These factors point to a potentially large reservoir of\u00a0\nunobserved infections \u200b(\u200b7\u200b)\u200b, especially in settings where capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2 has been\u00a0\nlimited \u200b(\u200b8\u200b)\u200b. The United States is one such country in which limited testing has been a major\u00a0\nconcern, particularly as imported cases, and now local cases, have increased over time \u200b(\u200b9\u200b)\u200b. Until\u00a0\nFebruary 27, testing criteria in the US were limited to close contacts of confirmed cases and\u00a0\nthose with recent travel to China \u200b(\u200b9\u200b)\u200b.

Due to the\u00a0exponential growth posited by our model, 2,958 (95% PPI: 956 - 7,249) local infections were\u00a0predicted to have occurred on March 12 alone (Fig. This suggests\u00a0that detection of local infections was less sensitive than detection of imported infections. By\u00a0March 12, we estimated \u03c1local to be 0.80 (95% PPI: 0.34 - 1.00). We jointly estimated the probability of detection of imported symptomatic\u00a0infections, \u03c1travel , and the relative offspring number of asymptomatic infections, \u03b1 , by running\u00a0the importation and branching process models across a range of values of those parameters\u00a0and calculating the probability of observing the number of reported deaths through March 12;\u00a0this approach is described in more detail in the parameter calibration section below. In doing so, we assumed that\u00a0the generation interval followed the same distribution as the serial interval. For infections that were simulated to\u00a0result in symptoms, the time of symptom onset was drawn from a Weibull incubation\u00a0period distribution with mean 7.07 \u200b(\u200b6\u200b)\u200b and added to each individual\u2019s exposure time. In that sense, all parameters in our\u00a0analysis were treated as random variables, with associated uncertainty accounted for\u00a0throughout our analysis. That is important because \u200bR\u200b and the serial interval jointly control the epidemic\u00a0growth rate \u200b(\u200b10\u200b)\u200b, so taking estimates of \u200bR\u200b and the serial interval from different studies could\u00a0have led to unrealistic projections of epidemic growth rate. This allowed any infections occurring by March 12 enough time to\u00a0result in death, for the proportion expected to result in that outcome. For each of these 200 replicate simulations, we\u00a0calculated the cumulative number of infections, \u200bI\u200bD\u200b, that, based on their timing, could have\u00a0resulted in death by March 12. We then calculated the likelihood of the reported number of\u00a0deaths, \u200bD\u200b, according to a binomial distribution in which \u200bD\u200b is the number of successes among \u200bI\u200bD\u00a0trials that each have probability of success IFR, where IFR is equal to the CFR times one minus\u00a0the probability of being asymptomatic. We repeated this calibration\u00a0procedure for each scenario that we explored, obtaining different estimates for \u03c1travel and \u03b1 for\u00a0each of our sensitivity analyses.

By jointly estimating \u03c1travel and the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic\u00a0infections, \u03b1 , we obtained a median estimate of 0.39 (95% PPI: 0.15 - 0.90) for \u03c1travel under our\u00a0baseline scenario. This resulted in a median of 452 (95% PPI: 206 - 1068) imported infections. In general, higher values for parameters expected\u00a0to increase transmission (e.g., \u200bR\u200b) were associated with higher estimates of \u03c1travel (Table S2). For a shorter serial interval with a mean of 4.7 days, the estimate was \u03c1travel = 0.52\u00a0(95% PPI: 0.19 - 0.96), and with a longer mean serial interval of 7.5 days, the estimate was 0.06\u00a0(95% PPI: 0.03 - 0.14). Higher \u03c1travel estimates correspond to fewer undetected imported infections;\u00a0therefore, fewer undetected importations are required to account for the observed number of\u00a0local deaths through March 12 if the CFR is high, \u200bR\u200b is high, or the serial interval is short. There was greater uncertainty in our  estimates\u00a0under most sensitivity scenarios, and in most scenarios the estimates of \u03c1travel and  were\u00a0positively correlated (Fig. Samples (10\u200b4\u200b) from the joint posterior distribution of the proportion of imported\u00a0symptomatic infections detected (\u03c1travel) and the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic\u00a0infections (\u03b1) under different parameter-sensitivity scenarios.
