The virus was subsequently identified as a beta-coronavirus and named severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is responsible of thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which includes asymptomatic, upper, andlower respiratory tract infections. Among the first European cases of COVID-19, 6 wereassociated with a cluster of transmission in the French Alps in late January 2020 [2]. Theindex case of this cluster travelled from Singapore to France and went back to the Unitedaimed to investigate the French cases related to this cluster using metagenomicnextgeneration sequencing analysis (mNGS).Of the 6 contact patients tested positive for SARS-CoV2, the 3 samples with highest viralloads (assessed by RT-PCR targeting the RdRp gene) were selected for mNGS [3]. Onenasopharyngeal swab was collected from a patient with an upper respiratory tract infection onFebruary 7th (sample #1, Ct = 31.3). The other two samples were collected from the sameasymptomatic patient on February 8th (sample #2, nasopharyngeal swab, Ct = 31.1) and 9th(sample #3, nasopharyngeal aspirate, Ct = 28.8).A previously described mNGS protocol was used but for which DNase treatment wasperformed after nucleic acid extraction in order to increase sensitivity of RNA viruses\u2019detection [4]. Low quality and human reads were filtered out and remaining reads werealigned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, EPI_ISL_402125) usingBWA-MEM algorithm. A mean of 19 445 767 reads per sample were generated, of which amean of 605 243 reads per sample were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome.Percentage of genome covered at a minimum depth of coverage of 100X was 38.3% forsample #1, 99.6% for sample #2 and 80.6% for sample #3.596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182The whole genome sequence (WGS) generated from sample #2 was deposited on GISAID(EPI_ISL_410486). The phylogenetic analysis using the 571 WGS of SARS-CoV-2 publiclyavailable (as of March 17th 2020) found that this sequence clustered with a sequence collectedvirus from Asia, as suggested by epidemiological data (Fig 1). Compared to the referenceSARS-CoV-2 sequence, a 3-nucleotide deletion in open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) atposition 1607-1609 was identified. This deletion was found in 100% of the reads at thisposition with a coverage of 1745X around the deletion. Importantly, this deletion was alsoidentified in 100% of the reads of sample #1 and sample #3 with a coverage of 54X and481X, respectively. Using CoV-GLUE resource, we found that this mutation leads to adeletion of amino acid 268 in non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) [5]. Up to March 17th, thisdeletion in nsp2 (Asp268Del) was also characterized in 37/571 (6.1%) WGS (England n = 6;Netherlands n = 31). WGS-based phylogenetic analysis found that 15 viruses containing thisspecific deletion were closed to viruses collected in China between December 2019 and earlyFebruary 2020, while 23 viruses collected in the Netherlands in March 2020 have slightlydiverged (Fig 1).SARS-CoV2 sequences were not further compared between the 2 patients due to largelyincomplete coverage of SARS-CoV2 genome in sample #1. Nonetheless, the longitudinalsamples from the asymptomatic patient (sample #2 vs sample #3) were compared using aminimum depth of coverage of 100X in order to make a preliminary assessment of intra-hostgenetic variability. Three SNVs were noticed between the 2 samples: C366A (nsp1: S34Y),A20475G (synonymous mutation in nsp15), T24084A (protein S: L841H), suggestingintrahost evolution of the virus. For all 3 positions, nucleotides from sample #2 were still detectedin sample #3 but as minor variants.8384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105In this short report, we present the first genetic characterization of a COVID-19 cluster inEurope. Despite low viral loads, the mNGS workflow used herein allowed to characterize thewhole genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 isolated from an asymptomatic patient, in 2 clinicalsamples collected 1 day apart. Comparison of these sequences suggests viral evolution withdevelopment of quasispecies. Specific studies using high depth of coverage to assessquasispecies are needed to characterize potential intra-host adaptation. In addition, the presentworkflow identified a new deletion in nsp2 (Asp268Del) which was found in all 3 samplesoriginating from this cluster as well as in 37 other viruses collected in England (February) andin Netherlands (March), suggesting the spread of this deletion in Europe. The impact ofAsp268Del on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenicity, as well as on PCR performancesand anti-viral strategy should be rapidly evaluated in further studies.The analysis included 571 WGS of SARS-CoV2 (>29k nt) collected in humans and availablein GISAID from March 17th, 2020. The following sequences were excluded from the analysis:EPI_ISL_406592, EPI_ISL_414588, EPI_ISL_412900, EPI_ISL_408487, EPI_ISL_408483and EPI_ISL_406595 because they were outliers, and EPI_ISL_413747, EPI_ISL_413695because of incomplete sequences in ORF1ab. The hCoV19/Wuhan/IPBCAMSWH01/2019strain was used as an outgroup virus. Genetic distances were calculated using the Kimura's2parameter model (K80) and pairwise deletion. The tree was constructed by theneighbourjoining method using R seqinr and ggtree packages and validated using 1000 bootstrappseudo-replicates. Sequence from sample #2 (EPI_ISL_410486) is shown by the arrow.Nucleotide alignment (1600 to 1614) is depicted as a heatmap on the right panel with3nucleotides deletion shown in black.106[1] Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, Li X, Yang B, Song J, et al.
