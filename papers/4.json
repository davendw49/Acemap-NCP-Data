Coronaviruses spike protein areglycoprotein that are embedded over the viral envelope. This spike protein attaches to specificcellular receptors and initiates structural changes of spike protein, and causes penetration of cellmembranes which results in the release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell [3]. The viral spikeprotein includes N-terminal, which is crucial for identification of Coronaviruses [4]. Coronaviruseshave a large RNA genome in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases and capable of obtainingdistinct ways of replication [5]. Like all other RNA viruses, coronavirus under goes replication ofgenome and transcription of mRNAs upon infection. Synthesis of a full-length negative-strandRNA serves as template for full-length genomic RNA [3][6]. Coronaviruses are a large family ofviruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales [7]. that are common inmany different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats [8], This group of virusescan cause wide varieties of respiratory illness in mammals and birds. In human, it causes commoncold, leading to severe illness pneumonia to elderly people and immunocompromised people, likehospital patients [9]. This viral pathogen was responsible for the Middle East RespiratorySyndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS), and 2019 Novel coronavirus(2019nCoV) in China outbreaks [10]. Coronavirus in form of SARS, MERS and Novel coronavirus arelethal leading to large number of deaths. Coronavirus subfamily is classified into four genera, thealpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. Human CoV infections are caused by alpha- andbetaCoVs. CoVs are common human pathogens, and 30% to 60% of the Chinese population is positivefor anti-CoV antibodies [11]. These viral infections caused by coronaviruses are generallyassociated the upper respiratory tract to lower respiratory tract. Immunocompromised people likeelderly people and infants are more vulnerable and susceptible to this group of viruses [12].For many decades HCoVs are well adapted to humans and it had been prevalent among Humanraces. In 1960s, first identification of Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) was made in patients withcommon cold. Following that incident more HCoVs has been detected, that involved the two majoroutbreak SARS and MERS, two pathogens that, upon infection, can cause fatal respiratory diseasein humans [13].The most common coronaviruses among humans are 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 and somecan evolve and cause human diseases, becoming new human coronaviruses. Three recent examplesof these are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [14]. SARS-CoV was the causal agent ofthe severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China.6-8 MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 inthe Middle East [15].Chinese scientists were able to sequence the viral genome using next genome sequencing from thecollected samples and identified the cause as a Sars-like coronavirus. The genetic sequence is nowavailable for scientist all around the world which would aid faster diagnosis of further cases [2][16][17]. Based on full genome sequence data on the Global Initiative on Sharing All InfluenzaData [GISAID] platform, the genetic sequence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)ensuring faster development of point-of-care real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tests specific for2019nCoV [18]. Association of genome sequence with other evidences demonstrated that 2019 nCoVis 75 to 80% identical to the SARS-CoV and even more closely related to several batcoronaviruses. 2019-nCoV can be cultured in the same cells that are ideal for growing SARS-CoVand MERS-CoV, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV grows better in primary humanairway epithelial cells than in standard tissue-culture cells [19]. Another group of scientists haveinvestigated the origin of the 2019- nCoV, using comprehensive sequence analysis and comparisonin conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) within different animal species andsequences of newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV. The evidence and analysis suggest that the2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknowncoronavirus. the viral spike glycoprotein recombined within themselves, and recognizes cellsurface receptor. Scientist are speculating that the 2019-nCoV originated form snakes based onHomologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein could be a probable way of transmissionin between snake and humans [20].        China is in its extremity due to the outbreak of a respiratory virus, called coronavirus andconsidered as related to SARS virus [21][22]. It is reported to be originated in the animal andseafood market of Wuhan, Hubei province, China \u2013 one of the largest cities in China which has11M residents thus entitled as Wuhan coronavirus or more commonly 2019-nCoV. [21] [23]World health organization (WHO) is investigating the virus since 31st December, 2019 after beingreported. [24][25] 2019-nCOV is a deadly virus and Chinese authority reported WHO a pneumonialike case on 31st December, 2019 and the infection has spread destructively since then [26]. Firstdeath of a 61 years old man was reported on 11th January by Chinese health authorities in Wuhan,Hubei province, China [25][27][28]. Second death of a 69 years old man was reported on 15thJanuary in the central city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China who had symptoms of pneumonia[29][        This experiment is carried out to design novel epitope-based vaccine against four proteins ofWuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) i.e., nucleocapsid phosphoprotein which is responsible forgenome packaging and viral assembly [82]; surface glycoprotein that is responsible for membranefusion event during viral entry [83][84]; ORF3a protein that is responsible for viral replication,characterized virulence, viral spreading and infection [85] and membrane glycoprotein whichmediates the interaction of virions with cell receptors [86] using the approaches of reversevaccinology.Reverse vaccinology refers to the process of developing vaccines where the novel antigens of avirus or microorganism or organism are detected by analyzing the genomic and geneticinformation of that particular virus or organism. In reverse vaccinology, the tools of bioinformaticsare used for identifying and analyzing these novel antigens. These tools are used to dissect thegenome and genetic makeup of a pathogen for developing a potential vaccine. Reversevaccinology approach of vaccine development also allows the scientists to easily understand theantigenic segments of a virus or pathogen that should be given more emphasis during the vaccinedevelopment. This method is a quick, cheap, efficient, easy and cost-effective way to designvaccine. Reverse vaccinology has successfully been used for developing vaccines to fight againstmany viruses i.e., the Zika virus, Chikungunya virus etc. [87][88].The current study was conducted to develop potential vaccines against the Wuhan novelcoronavirus (strain 2019-nCoV) (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus) exploiting thestrategies of reverse vaccinology (Figure 01).The strain of the Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019 was selected by reviewing various entries of theonlinedatabaseFour protein sequences i.e., nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43423.2),membrane glycoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43419.1), ORF3a protein (PubMedaccession no: QHD43417.1) and surface glycoprotein (PubMed accession no: QHD43416.1) weredownloaded from the NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database in fasta format.The antigenicity of protein sequences was determined using an online tool called VaxiJen v2.0(http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm). During the antigenicity prediction,the threshold was set at 0.4 in the tumor model [89]-[91]. Only the protein sequences that werefound to be highly antigenic, were selected for further analysis. Next, the selected antigenic proteinsequenceswereanalyzedbyonlinetoolandProtParam(https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) to determine their physicochemical properties [92]. Differentphysicochemical properties i.e., the number of amino acids, molecular weight, theoretical pI,extinction co-efficient, estimated half-life, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity(GRAVY) were then determined.The online epitope prediction server Immune Epitope Database or IEDB (https://www.iedb.org/)was used for T-cell and B-cell epitope prediction. The database contains a huge collection ofexperimental data on T-cell epitopes and antibodies. These experimental data are collected fromvarious experiments that are conducted on human, non-human primates and other animals [93].The NetMHCpan EL 4.0 prediction method was used for MHC class-I restricted CD8+ cytotoxicT-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope prediction for HLA-A*11-01 allele and the MHC class-II restrictedCD4+ helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were predicted for HLA DRB1*04-01 allele, usingthe Sturniolo prediction method. Ten of the top twenty MHC class-I and MHC class-II epitopeswere randomly selected based on their antigenicity scores (AS) and percentile scores. For, theBcell lymphocytic epitopes (BCL), with amino acid number of more than ten, were selected andpredicted using Bipipered linear epitope prediction method.The epitopes selected in the previous step were then used in the transmembrane topologyexperiment using the transmembrane topology of protein helices determinant, TMHMM v2.0server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) [94]. The antigenicity of the epitopes weredeterminedagainbytheonlineVaxiJenpharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm) server and the threshold for the tumor model was keptThe allergenicity of the selected epitopes were predicted using two online tools i.e., AllerTOP v2.0wellAllergenFPpharmfac.net/AllergenFP/). During the selection after the allergenicity prediction, the resultspredicted by the AllerTOP server were given more priority because the server has better accuracy(88.7%) than AllergenFP server of 87.9% [95][96]. The toxicity prediction of the selected epitopeswas carried out using ToxinPred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/) using SVM(support vector method) based method, keeping all the parameters default. After the antigenicity,allergenicity and toxicity tests, the epitopes that were found to be antigenic, non-allergenic andnon-toxic, were considered as the best possible epitopes and the sequences that were found to behighly antigenic as well as non-allergenic, were considered as B-cell epitopes and as a result usedin the next phases of this experiment.The cluster analysis of the MHC alleles was carried out to identify the alleles of the MHC class-Iand class-II molecules with similar binding specificities. The cluster analysis of the MHC alleleswere carried out using online tool MHCcluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MHCcluster/)[97]. During the analysis, the number of peptides to be included was kept at 50,000, the numberof bootstrap calculations were set to 100 and all the HLA supertype representatives (MHCclassI) as well as the HLA-DR representatives (MHC class-II) were also selected. TheNetMHCpan2.8 prediction method was used for analyzing the MHC class-I alleles. The server depicts theresults in the forms of MHC specificity tree and MHC specificity heat-map.The 3D structures of the epitopes were generated using PEP-FOLD3(http://bioserv.rpbs.univparis-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3/) server. Only the best selected epitopes from previousexperiments were used for 3D structure generation [98]-[100].Themolecularstudyof theepitopeswereconductedusing(https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server against HLA-A*11-01 allele (PDB ID:5WJL) and HLA DRB1*04-01 (PDB ID: 5JLZ). PatchDock tool is an online docking tool thatworks on specific algorithms. The algorithms divide the connolly dot surface representations ofthe compounds into concave and convex patches as well as flat patches. Next, the complementarypatches are matched for generating candidate transformations as well as potential solutions.Finally, an RMSD (root mean square deviation) score is applied to the candidate solutions.Thereafter, the redundant solutions are discarded based on analyzing the RMSD score. The topscored solutions are considered as the top ranked solutions by the server. After successful dockingby PatchDock, the refinement and re-scoring of the docking results were carried out by theFireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). After refinement of the dockingscores, the FireDock server generates global energies for the best solutions and ranks them basedon the generated global energies and the lowest global energy is always considered as the bestdocking score [101]-[104]. The best results were visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer[105].Three possible vaccines were constructed against the selected Wuhan novel coronavirus. Thepredicted CTL, HTL and BCL epitopes were joined together by linkers for vaccine construction.The vaccines were constructed maintaining the sequence i.e., adjuvant, PADRE sequence, CTLepitopes, HTL epitopes and BCL epitopes. Three different adjuvants i.e., beta defensin, L7/L12ribosomal protein andAGV15514.1), were used and the three vaccines differ from each other by their adjuvant sequence.Beta-defensin adjuvant acts as agonist and stimulate the activation of the toll like receptors (TLRs):1, 2 and 4. Studies have showed that L7/L12 ribosomal protein and HABA protein also activateTLR-4. During the vaccine construction, EAAAK linkers were used to connect the adjuvant withthe PADRE sequence, GGGS linkers were used to attach the PADRE sequence with the CTLepitopes and the CTL epitopes with the other CTL epitopes, GPGPG linkers were used to conjugatethe CTL epitopes with the HTL epitopes and also the HTL epitopes themselves. The KK linkerswere used to attach the HTL epitopes with the BCL epitopes. Studies have showed that, thePADRE sequence stimulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response of the vaccines that contain it[106]-[116].The antigenicity of the constructed vaccines was predicted by the online server VaxiJen v2.0(http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.htm) using the tumor model where thethreshold was kept at 0.4. The allergenicity of the predicted vaccines were determined by twoonlinetoolsi.e.,based on similarity of the known epitope of any of the known region of a protein [117].MEME/MAST motif prediction was used to predict the allergenicity of the vaccines by AlgPred.Later, the online server ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was used to predictdifferent physicochemical properties of the constructed vaccines.The secondary structure generation of the vaccine constructs were performed using online serverPRISPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/), which is a simple and easy secondary structuregenerating tool and can predict the transmembrane topology, transmembrane helix, fold anddomain recognition with certain degrees of accuracy[118][119]. The secondary structures of thevaccine constructs were predicted using the PRISPRED 4.0 prediction method. Next, anotheronline tool, NetTurnP v1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetTurnP/) was used to predict the\u03b2sheet structure of the vaccines [120]. The 3D structures of the vaccines were then generated usingonline server RaptorX (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) [121]-[123].The 3D structures of the constructed vaccines were refined using online protein refinement tool,3Drefine (http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/3Drefine/) [124]. For each of the vaccine, the refinedmodel 1 was downloaded for validation. The validation was then performed by analyzing theRamachandranplotswhichweregeneratedusingthe(https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/) server [125][126].The vaccine protein disulfide engineering was carried out with the aid of Disulfide by Design 2v12.2 (http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/DbD2/) server which predicts the potential sites within aprotein structure that have higher possibility of undergoing disulfide bond formation [127]. Duringdisulfide engineering, the intra-chain, inter-chain and C\u03b2 for glycine residue were selected and the\u03c73 Angle was kept -87\u00b0 or +97\u00b0 \u00b1 5 and C\u03b1-C\u03b2-S\u03b3 Angle was kept 114.6\u00b0 \u00b110.In protein-protein docking, the constructed Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019 vaccines were analyzedby docking against some MHC alleles as well as the toll like receptor (TLR) and then one bestvaccine was selected based on the docking scores. During viral infections, the MHC complexrecognize the viral particles as potent antigens. The various portions of the MHC molecules areencoded by different MHC alleles. For this reason, the constructed vaccines should have very goodbinding affinity with these segments of the MHC complex that are encoded by different alleles[128]. In this experiment, all the vaccines constructs were docked against DRB1*0101 (PDB ID:2FSE), DRB3*0202 (PDB ID: 1A6A), DRB5*0101 (PDB ID: 1H15), DRB3*0101 (PDB ID:2Q6W), DRB1*0401 (PDB ID: 2SEB), and DRB1*0301 (PDB ID: 3C5J) alleles. Moreover, it hasbeen proved that TLR-8 is responsible for mediating the immune responses against the RNAviruses and TLR-3 is responsible for mediating immune responses against the DNA viruses[129][130]. The coronavirus is an RNA virus [131]. For this reason, the vaccine constructs ofWuhan novel coronavirus were docked against TLR-8 (PDB ID: 3W3M). The protein-proteindocking study was conducted using different online docking tools to improve the predictionaccuracy of the docking study. At first, the docking was performed by ClusPro 2.0(https://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php). The server ranks the docked complexes based on their centerscores and lowest energy scores. However, these scores do not correspond to the actual bindingaffinity of the proteins with their targets [132]-[134]. The binding affinity (\u0394G in kcal mol-1) ofthe docked complexes were later generated and analyzed by PRODIGY tool of HADDOCKwebserver (https://haddock.science.uu.nl/). The lower binding energy represents the higherbinding affinity and vice versa [135]-[137]. After that, the docking was again carried out byPatchDock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php) server and later refined andrescored by FireDock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php). The FireDock serverranks the docked complexes based on their global energy and the lower global energy representsthebetterdockingwasusingserver(http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/hawkdock/). At this stage, the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized BornSurface Area (MM-GBSA) study was also calculated by the HawkDock server which works onspecific algorithm that depicts that, the lower score and lower energy represent the better scores[138]-[141]. For each of the vaccines and their respective targets, the score of model 1 was takenfor analysis as well as the model 1 of every complex was taken into consideration for MM-GBSAstudy. From the docking experiment, one best vaccine was selected. The docked structures werevisualized by PyMol tool [142].The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study was carried out for only the best selected vaccine.The online MD simulation tool, iMODS (http://imods.chaconlab.org/) was used for moleculardynamics simulation study. iMODS server is a fast, online, user-friendly and effective moleculardynamics simulation server. The deformability, B-factor (mobility profiles), eigenvalues, variance,co-variance map and elastic network of the protein complex, are predicted quite efficiently by theserver. For a protein complex, the deformability depends on the ability to deform at each of itsamino acid. The eigenvalue represents the motion stiffness of the protein complex and the energythat is required to deform the structure. The lower eigenvalue represents easy deformability of thecomplex. The server is a fast and easy tool for determining and measuring the protein flexibility[143]-[147]. For analysing the molecular dynamics simulation, the CV-1-TLR-8 docked complexwas used.The best predicted vaccine from the previous steps, was reverse transcribed to a possible DNAsequence which is supposed to express the vaccine protein. The reverse transcribed DNA sequencewas adapted according to the target organism, so that the cellular machinery of that organism coulduse the codons of the newly adapted DNA sequence efficiently for producing the desired vaccine.Codon adaptation is a necessary step of in silico cloning since an amino acid can be encoded bydifferent codons in different organisms (codon biasness) and codon adaptation predicts the bestcodon for a specific amino acid that should work properly in a particular organism. The predictedprotein sequence of the best selected vaccines were used for codon adaptation by the Java CodonAdaptation Tool or JCat server (http://www.jcat.de/). Eukaryotic E. coli strain K12 was selectedat the JCat server and rho-independent transcription terminators, prokaryotic ribosome bindingsites and SgrA1 and SphI cleavage sites of restriction enzymes, were avoided. The proteinsequence was reverse translated to the optimized possible DNA sequence by the JCat server. Theoptimized DNA sequence was then taken and SgrA1 and SphI restriction sites were attached tothe N-terminal and C-terminal sites, respectively. Finally, the SnapGene restriction cloningmodule was used to insert the newly adapted DNA sequence between the SgrA1 and SphIrestriction sites of pET-19b vector [148]-[150].The Wuhan novel coronavirus (Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus) was identified from theNCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Four protein sequences i.e., NucleocapsidPhosphoprotein (accession no: QHD43423.2), Membrane Glycoprotein (accession no:QHD43419.1), ORF3a Protein (accession no: QHD43417.1) and Surface Glycoprotein (accessionno: QHD43416.1) were selected for possible vaccine construction and retrieved from the NCBI>QHD43423.2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus]MSDNGPQNQRNAPRITFGGPSDSTGSNQNGERSGARSKQRRPQGLPNNTASWFTALTQHGKEDLKFPRGQGVPINTNSSPDDQIGYYRRATRRIRGGDGKMKDLSPRWYFYYLGTGPEAGLPYGANKDGIIWVATEGALNTPKDHIGTRNPANNAAIVLQLPQGTTLPKGFYAEGSRGGSQASSRSSSRSRNSSRNSTPGSSRGTSPARMAGNGGDAALALLLLDRLNQLESKMSGKGQQQQGQTVTKKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATKAYNVTQAFGRRGPEQTQGNFGDQELIRQGTDYKHWPQIAQFAPSASAFFGMSRIGMEVTPSGTWLTYTGAIKLDDKDPNFKDQVILLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPKKDKKKKADETQALPQRQKKQQTVTLLPAADLDDFSKQLQQSMSSADSTQA>QHD43419.1 membrane glycoprotein [Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus]MADSNGTITVEELKKLLEQWNLVIGFLFLTWICLLQFAYANRNRFLYIIKLIFLWLLWPVTLACFVLAAVYRINWITGGIAIAMACLVGLMWLSYFIASFRLFARTRSMWSFNPETNILLNVPLHGTILTRPLLESELVIGAVILRGHLRIAGHHLGRCDIKDLPKEITVATSRTLSYYKLGASQRVAGDSGFAAYSRYRIGNYKLNTDHSSSSDNIALLVQ>QHD43417.1 ORF3a protein [Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus]MDLFMRIFTIGTVTLKQGEIKDATPSDFVRATATIPIQASLPFGWLIVGVALLAVFQSASKIITLKKRWQLALSKGVHFVCNLLLLFVTVYSHLLLVAAGLEAPFLYLYALVYFLQSINFVRIIMRLWLCWKCRSKNPLLYDANYFLCWHTNCYDYCIPYNSVTSSIVITSGDGTTSPISEHDYQIGGYTEKWESGVKDCVVLHSYFTSDYYQLYSTQLSTDTGVEHVTFFIYNKIVDEPEEHVQIHTIDGSSGVVNPVMEPIYDEPTTTTSVPL>QHD43416.1 surface glycoprotein [Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus]MFVFLVLLPLVSSQCVNLTTRTQLPPAYTNSFTRGVYYPDKVFRSSVLHSTQDLFLPFFSNVTWFHAIHVSGTNGTKRFDNPVLPFNDGVYFASTEKSNIIRGWIFGTTLDSKTQSLLIVNNATNVVIKVCEFQFCNDPFLGVYYHKNNKSWMESEFRVYSSANNCTFEYVSQPFLMDof reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. To design the vaccines, the highly antigenic viralproteins as well as epitopes were used. Various computational studies of the suggested vaccineconstructs revealed that these vaccines might confer good immunogenic response. For this reason,if satisfactory results are achieved in various in vivo and in vitro tests and trials, these suggestedvaccine constructs might be used effectively for vaccination to prevent the coronavirus infectionand spreading. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccinesand thapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.Authors declare no conflict of interest regarding the publication of the manuscript.Authors made all the data generated during experiment and analysis available within theAuthors received no specific funding from any external sources.Authors acknowledge the members of Swift Integrity Computational Lab, Dhaka, Bangladesh, avirtual platform of young researchers for their support during the preparation of the manuscript.JAMA. 2020;.[1] Gallagher T, Buchmeier M.

To date,\nthere is no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection\ncaused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines\nagainst the 2019-nCoV using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics.\nUpon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed\nand one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study\nwhich is supposed to effectively act against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus. Later, molecular\ndynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check\nbiological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully,\nthis study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive\ntreatment against this nasty virus.", "one_words_summarize": "Wuhan Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has become global pandemic which has raisedthe concern of scientific community to deign and discover a definitive cure against this deadlyvirus which has caused deaths of numerous infected people upon infection and spreading. Later, moleculardynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to checkbiological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. The viral spikeprotein includes N-terminal, which is crucial for identification of Coronaviruses [4]. Coronaviruses are a large family ofviruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales [7]. In human, it causes commoncold, leading to severe illness pneumonia to elderly people and immunocompromised people, likehospital patients [9]. SARS-CoV was the causal agent ofthe severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China.6-8 MERS-CoV was the pathogen responsible for severe respiratory disease outbreaks in 2012 inthe Middle East [15].Chinese scientists were able to sequence the viral genome using next genome sequencing from thecollected samples and identified the cause as a Sars-like coronavirus. Reverse vaccinology refers to the process of developing vaccines where the novel antigens of avirus or microorganism or organism are detected by analyzing the genomic and geneticinformation of that particular virus or organism. These tools are used to dissect thegenome and genetic makeup of a pathogen for developing a potential vaccine. During the selection after the allergenicity prediction, the resultspredicted by the AllerTOP server were given more priority because the server has better accuracy(88.7%) than AllergenFP server of 87.9% [95][96]. The algorithms divide the connolly dot surface representations ofthe compounds into concave and convex patches as well as flat patches. Thereafter, the redundant solutions are discarded based on analyzing the RMSD score. Three different adjuvants i.e., beta defensin, L7/L12ribosomal protein andAGV15514.1), were used and the three vaccines differ from each other by their adjuvant sequence. Studies have showed that L7/L12 ribosomal protein and HABA protein also activateTLR-4. ,based on similarity of the known epitope of any of the known region of a protein [117].MEME/MAST motif prediction was used to predict the allergenicity of the vaccines by AlgPred. For each of the vaccine, the refinedmodel 1 was downloaded for validation. The validation was then performed by analyzing theRamachandranplotswhichweregeneratedusingthe(https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK/) server [125][126].The vaccine protein disulfide engineering was carried out with the aid of Disulfide by Design 2v12.2 (http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/DbD2/) server which predicts the potential sites within aprotein structure that have higher possibility of undergoing disulfide bond formation [127]. Duringdisulfide engineering, the intra-chain, inter-chain and C\u03b2 for glycine residue were selected and the\u03c73 Angle was kept -87\u00b0 or +97\u00b0 \u00b1 5 and C\u03b1-C\u03b2-S\u03b3 Angle was kept 114.6\u00b0 \u00b110.In protein-protein docking, the constructed Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019 vaccines were analyzedby docking against some MHC alleles as well as the toll like receptor (TLR) and then one bestvaccine was selected based on the docking scores. The protein-proteindocking study was conducted using different online docking tools to improve the predictionaccuracy of the docking study. The lower binding energy represents the higherbinding affinity and vice versa [135]-[137]. iMODS server is a fast, online, user-friendly and effective moleculardynamics simulation server. For a protein complex, the deformability depends on the ability to deform at each of itsamino acid. Therefore, our present study should help the scientists to develop potential vaccinesand thapeutics against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus 2019.Authors declare no conflict of interest regarding the publication of the manuscript.
