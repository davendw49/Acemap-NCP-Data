{"date": "2020/02/19", "journal": "biorxiv", "authors": "Ethan Fast, Binbin Chen", "title": "Potential T-cell and B-cell Epitopes of 2019-nCoV", "type": "preprint article", "abstract": "As of Feb 16th 2020, 2019-nCoV has infected more than 51,857 people across 26 countries and claimed 1666 lives. 2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-nCoV or any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.", "text": "        Coronaviruses (CoV) first became widely known after the emergence of severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS) in 2002. They are are positive, single-strand RNA viruses that often infect birdsand a variety of mammals and sometimes migrate to humans [                In December 2019, several patients with a connection in Wuhan, China developed symptoms of viralpneumonia. Sequencing of viral RNA determined that these cases were caused by a novel coronavirusnamed 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2 [                The deployment of a vaccine against 2019-nCoV would arrest its infection rate and help protectvulnerable populations. However, no vaccine has yet passed beyond clinical trails for any coronavirus,whether in humans or other animals [                Both humoral immunity provided by B-cell antibodies and cellular immunity provided by T-cells areessential for effective vaccines [                Beyond neutralizing antibodies, human bodies also rely upon cytotoxic CD8 T-cells and helper CD4T-cells to fully clear viruses. The presentation of viral peptides by human Major HistocompatibilityComplex (MHC or HLA) class I and class II is essential for anti-viral T-cell responses [                Next we focus on B-cell epitopes. The spike (S) protein is the main trans-membrane glycoproteinexpressed on the surface of 2019-nCoV and is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry tocells [                Finally, we examine the viral mutation pattern. Thanks to global sequencing efforts [                  We obtained 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2019) and SARS-CoV reference sequence data from NCBIGeneBank (NC_045512 and NC_004718) [                    We broke each gene sequence in 2019-nCoV into sliding windows of length 9, the median lengthof MHC-I ligands, and 15, the median length of MHC-II ligands. We used netMHCpan4 [          Both MARIA and netMHCpan4 return percentiles that characterize a peptide\u2019s likelihood ofpresentation relative to preset distribution of random human peptide scores. Prior work recommendsthresholds of 98% for NetMHCpan4 and 95% for MARIA to determine reasonable presenters. Wealso applied our analysis with a more stringent 99.5% threshold for both NetMHCpan4 and MARIA.We used gene expression values of 50 TPM when running MARIA to reflect the high expressionvalues of viral genes in human cells.When aggregating alleles across MHC-I and MHC-II to report overall coverage, we marked a peptidesequence as covered if it is presented by more then 33% of common alleles. We chose 33% as acut-off because it suggests a high (>90%) probability that at least one allele can present this peptideassuming the patient carries six MHC alleles (e.g. 2 As, 2 Bs, and 2 Cs) and the distribution ofcommon MHC alleles in the population is random. We ranked potential T-cell epitopes based on theirMHC-I and MHC-II presentation coverage across alleles.2.3          We applied our methodology to known SARS T-cell epitopes and non-epitope SARS peptides toestimate our ability to predict 2019-nCoV epitopes. For MHC-I, we curated 17 experimentallydetermined HLA-A*02:01 associated CD8 T-cell epitopes and 1236 non-epitope 9mer sliding windowson SARS S protein [                    We obtained an approximate 3D structure of 2019-nCoV S protein by homology modeling SARSS protein (PDB: 6ACC) with SWISS-MODEL [          ORF1abSORF3aEMORF6ORF7aORF7bORF8NORF10HLA-AHLA-BHLA-C          HLA-DR(Supplementary File 1). We used a computational docking algorithm, ClusPro2 [                    We predicted likely human antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes) on SARS and 2019-nCoV Sprotein with Disctope2 [                    We aimed to determine whether there was any statistical relationship between regions of mutation andpresentation. We translated viral genome sequences into protein sequences using BioPython [                    We computed Fisher\u2019s exact test with scipy [          We scanned 11 2019-nCoV genes with NetMHCpan4 and MARIA to identify regions highlypresentable by HLA complexes (human MHC). A epitope is labeled positive if presentable by morethan one third of common alleles among the Chinese population. We display a summary of our          T-cell epitope findings in Table 1. In Fig. 2 we show regions of strong MHC presentation acrossHLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DR alleles, both at a medium threshold (Fig. 2A), and at a highthreshold ( Fig. 2B). Consistent with the similar finding from SARS-CoV, proteins ORF1AB, S, andE contain high numbers of presentable antigen sequences across both MHC-I and MHC-II [                    NetMHCpan4 predicts that a larger number of 2019-nCoV protein sequences can be presented byHLA-C alleles across all genes (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p = 4:2e 59) compared to HLA-A orHLAB (Table 1). Specifically, ORF1ab (p = 6:7e 54), S (p = 1:4e 9), ORF3a (p = 0:01), and M(p = 0:025) can be better presented by HLA-C alleles after Bonferroni correction. This might bedue to relatively conserved HLA-C binding motif on the 9th position (the main anchor residue)where Leucine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Tyrosine are commonly favored across alleles [                    To estimate the ability of antigen presentation scores to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell epitopes, weperformed a validation study with known SARS-CoV CD8 and CD4 T-cell epitopes (Fig. 3). From 4independent experimental studies [                    Human immune selection pressure has been shown to drive viral mutations which evade immunesurveillance (e.g. low MHC presentation). We hypothesize that a similar phenomenon can occur in2019-nCoV. We curated a cohort of 68 viral genomes across four continents and identified 93 pointmutations, 2 nonsense mutation and 1 deletion mutation compared to the published reference genome[                    We obtained the likely 3D structure of 2019-nCoV\u2019s spike protein (Supplementary File 1) byhomology modeling with SARS-CoV\u2019s spike protein (PDB: 6ACC). We scanned both spike proteinstructures with Discotope2 to identify potential antibody binding sites on the protein surface (Fig. 5).For the SARS-CoV S protein, we identified a strong cluster of antibody sites (>30 residues, pink orred) on the receptor binding domain (RBD, the ACE2 interacting surface). Three independent studies[          SORF1abMNE4946897142621056154715642368154027839726452YesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYes52%74%70%65%65%83%78%78%74%74%65%74%74%YesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYes100%100%100%100%100%100%100%100%100%100%100%100%100%YesNoNoNo?NoNoNoNoNo???We identified 8 point mutation sites on S protein from a cohort of 68 2019-nCoV samples (Fig. 5D).All mutations are apart from the protein S RBD, and one mutation (S247R) occurs near one of thepredicted minor antibody binding site (residue 246-257).          In summary, we observed major structural and B-cell epitope similarity between SARS-CoV and2019-nCoV spike proteins. A recent Cryo-EM study of 2019-nCoV S protein [                    After understanding the landscape of T-cell and B-cell epitopes of 2019-nCoV, we summarize ourresults in Table 2 for promising candidates for 2019-nCoV vaccines. Ideal antigens should bepresented by multiple MHC-I and MHC-II alleles in a general population and contain linear B-cellepitopes associated with neutralizing antibodies. Specifically, we first identified regions with highcoverage of MHC-II, then ranked them based on their MHC-I coverage. We further search these topcandidates with 90% sequence similarity on IEDB [                    Around 1000 peptide 15mers can be presented by a wide range of MHC-II (>33%), which is consistentwith our knowledge about promiscuity of MHC-II presentation [                  In summary, we analyzed the 2019-nCoV viral genome for epitope candidates and found 405 likelyT-Cell epitopes, with strong MHC-I and MHC-II presentation scores, and 2 potential neutralizingB-Cell epitopes on S protein. We validated our methodology by running a similar analysis onSARS-CoV against known SARS T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Inspecting 68 samples, we found thatviral mutations have a tendency to occur in regions with strong MHC-I presentation, which can be aform of immune evasion. However, no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor bindingdomain which is critical for viral entrance to cells and neutralizing antibody binding.Similar to SARS-CoV [                From an economic perspective, the development of coronavirus vaccines faces significant financialhurdles as most such viruses do not cause endemic infections. After an epidemic episode (e.g. SARS)there is little financial incentive for private companies to develop vaccines against a specific strainof virus [                Our pipeline provides a framework to identify strong epitope-based vaccine candidates\u2014beyond2019-nCoV\u2014and might be applied against any unknown pathogens. Previous animal studies doshow antigens with high MHC presentation scores are more likely to elicit strong T-cell responses,but the correlation between vaccine efficacy and T-cell responses is relatively weak [        Supplementary Table 1.
