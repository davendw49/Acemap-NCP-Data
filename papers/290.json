Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents = 2:1 0:3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population.

INTRODUCTION        The current outbreak of the new coronavirus in MainlandChina (COVID-19, previously named 2019-nCoV) is closelymonitored by governments, researchers, and the public alike[                Confirmed cases in Mainland China increased from approx.330 on Jan. 21st, 2020 to more than 17,000 on Feb. 2nd, 2020in a matter of two weeks [                An initial exponential growth of confirmed cases isgenerically expected for an uncontrolled outbreak and in most casesmitigated with a time delay by effective containmentstrategies and policies that reduce transmission and effectivereproduction of the virus, commonly yielding a saturation in thecumulative case count and an exponential decay in thenumber of new infections. Although in Hubei the number of caseswas observed to grow exponentially in early January [                The universality of the scaling relation t with similarexponents is evidence that this aspect of the dynamics isdetermined by fundamental principles that are at work and robustwith respect to variation of other parameters that typicallyshape the temporal evolution of epidemic processes. Threequestions immediately arise, (i) what may be the reason forthis functional dependency, (ii) are provinces other than Hubeimostly driven by export cases from Hubei and thereforefollow a similar functional form in case counts as suggested bypreliminary studies [        Here we propose a parsimonious epidemiological modelthat incorporates quarantine measures and containmentpolicies. In addition to standard epidemiological parameters suchas transmission and recovery rate, the model introduceseffective quarantine measures that act on both, symptomaticinfected individuals as well as susceptible individuals. Weshow that depleting both \u201cends\u201d of the transmissioninteractions that involve an infectious and a susceptible individualnaturally yields a sub-exponential, algebraic increase inconfirmed cases. This behavior is qualitatively different from thebehavior expected in a scenario in which only infecteds aretargets of containment strategies to reduce transmission. Inthis case one expects either a stable exponential growth at alower rate or an exponential decay if mitigation is sufficientlyeffective.        The model predicts the observed growth of casenumbers exceptionally well for almost all affected provinces forepidemiological parameters estimated by preliminary studies[        II. SITUATION ASSESSMENT        We rely on case number data provided by the SystemsScience and Engineering group of Johns Hopkins University whocurrently give up to two updates per day on the number oflaboratory-confirmed cases globally [        In Hubei, we find that the initital increase in confirmedcases is followed by an algebraic scaling with time, i.e.C\u00b9t\u00ba / t , with a scaling exponent 2:3 that persisted untilFeb. 9th, see Fig. 1A. On Feb. 12th, the case definition waschanged by Chinese authorities which labeled a largenumber of previously unconfirmed cases as confirmed, leading toa discontinuity in the curves. We will therefore only considerdata prior to Feb. 12th, 6am UTC.        The Chinese government put several mitigation policies inplace to contain the spread of the epidemic. In particular,positively diagnosed cases were either quarantined or put undera form of self-quarantine at home [                Additionally, measures were implemented that aimed atthe protection of the susceptible population by the partialshutdown of public life. For instance, universities remainedclosed, many businesses closed down, and people were askedto remain in their homes for as much time as possible [        III. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELING WITHQUARANTINE AND ISOLATION        On a very basic level, an outbreak as the one in Hubeiis captured by SIR dynamics [        Initially, a small fraction of infecteds yields anexponential growth if the basic reproduction number is larger thanunity. When the supply of susceptibles is depleted, theepidemic reaches a maximum and the infecteds decline. Asimple reduction of contacts caused by isolation policies could beassociated with a reduction in the effective reproductionnumber, which would, however, still yield an exponential growthin the fraction of infecteds as long as R0 > 1, inconsistent withthe observed scaling law t discussed above. To test thehypothesis that the observed growth behavior can be caused byisolation policies that apply to both, infected and susceptibleindividuals, by effective public shutdown policies, we extendthe SIR model by two additional mechanisms one of whichcan be interpreted as a process of removing susceptibles fromthe transmission process. First, we assume that generalpublic containment policies or individual behavioral changes inresponse to the epidemic effectively remove individuals fromthe interaction dynamics or significantly reduce theirparticipation in the transmission dynamics. Secondly, we accountfor the removal of symptomatic infected individuals byquarantine procedures. The dynamics is governed by the systemof ordinary differential equations:SII0S0 IIa generalization of the standard SIR model, henceforthreferred to as the SIR-X model. The rate parameters andquantify the transmission rate and the recovery rate of thestandard SIR model, respectively. Additionally, the impactof public containment is captured by the terms proportionalto the containment rate 0 that is effective in both I and Spopulations. Infected individuals are removed at ratecorresponding to quarantine measures that only affect symptomaticinfecteds. The new compartment X quantifies symptomatic,quarantined infecteds. Here we assume that the fraction X\u00b9t\u00bais proportional to the empirical confirmed and reported cases.The case 0 = 0 corresponds to a scenario in which thegeneral population is unaffected by policies or does not commit(1)(2)(3)behavioral changes in response to an epidemic. The case = 0corresponds to a scenario in which symptomatic infecteds arenot isolated specifically. Note that infecteds are alwaysremoved from their compartment I at a higher rate thansusceptibles as + + 0 > 0.In the basic SIR model that captures unconstrained, freespread of the disease, the basic reproduction number R0 isrelated to transmission and recovery rate by R0 R0;free = \u009dbecause 1 = TI is the average time an infected individualremains infectious before recovery or removal. Here, thetime period that an infected individual remains infectious isTI;eff = \u00b9 + 0 + \u00ba 1 such that the effective, or \u201cobserved\u201dreproduction number R0;eff = TI;eff is smaller than R0;free sinceboth 0 > 0 and > 0.We introduce public containment leveragethat reflects how strong isolation measures affect thegeneral public in comparison to quarantine measures imposed onsymptomatic infecteds alone. We further defineP =as the quarantine probability, i.e. the probability that aninfected is identified and quarantined either in specializedhospital wards or at home.The key mechanism at work in the model defined byEqs. (1)-(3) is the exponentially fast depletion of susceptiblesin addition to isolation of infecteds. This effect is sufficientto account for the observed scaling law in the number ofconfirmed cases for a plausible range of rate parameters asdiscussed below.IV. RESULTSWe assume that a small number of infected individualstravelled from Hubei to each of the other affected provinces beforetraffic restrictions were effective but at a time whencontainment measures were just being implemented. Fig. 2 illustratesthe degree to which the case count for Hubei province and theaggregated case count for all other provinces is captured bythe SIR-X model as defined by Eqs. (1)-(3).        We find that for a wide range of model parameters, the casecount is well reproduced by the model. The model reproducesthe scaling law t as observed in the data for a significantperiod of time before saturating to a finite level. Remarkably, themodel is able to reproduce both growth behaviors observedin the data: The model predicts the expected initial growthof case numbers in Hubei Province followed by an algebraicgrowth episode for 11 days until the saturation sets in, aconsequence of the decay of unidentified infected individualsafter a peak time around Feb. 7th (see Fig. 2A). Furthermore, themodel also captures the immediate sub-exponential growthobserved in the remaining most affected provinces (Fig.2BC). Again, saturation is induced by a decay of unidentifiedinfecteds after peaks that occur several days before peak timein Hubei, ranging from Jan. 31st to Feb. 5th. For all provinces,following their respective peaks the number of unidentifiedinfecteds I\u00b9t\u00ba decays over a time period that is longer than thereported estimation of maximum incubation period of 14 days[                Parameter choices for best fits were a fixed basicreproduction number of R0;free = 6:2 (note that this reproductionnumber corresponds to an unconstrained epidemic) and a fixedmean infection duration of TI = 8 d consistent withprevious reports concerning the incubation period of COVID-19[        A detailed analysis of the obtained values for quarantineprobability Q and public containment leverage P indicatesthat a wide range of these parameters can account forsimilar shapes of the respective case counts. Consequently, themodel is structurally stable with respect to these parametersand the numerical value is of less importance than the qualityof the mechanism they control (see App. A).For the remaining 20 provinces, we find growth behaviorssimilar to the ones discussed before. Some follow afunctional form comparable to the case counts in Hubei, othersdisplay a stronger agreement with pure algebraic growth, ascan be seen in Fig. 3. Generally, a stronger agreement withalgebraic growth can be associated with stronger publiccontainment leverages.In order to stress the general importance of publiccontainment measures and to clarify to what extent quarantine isconnected to case confirmation we also analyzed a model variantwhere (i) the general public and infecteds are removed fromthe transmission process in the same way and (ii) casecounting is decoupled from the quarantine process (see App. C).We find that these model variants describe the real case countdata reasonably well for the majority of provinces, furtherevidence of the importance of containment policies that targetthe susceptible population. In App. B we present furtheranalytical evidence for this conclusion.Note that the described saturation behavior of confirmedcases requires that eventually all susceptibles will effectivelybe removed from the transmission process. In reality, notevery susceptible person can be isolated for such an extendedperiod of time as the model suggests. One might expectinstead that the number of infecteds will decay more slowly andsaturate to a small, yet non-zero level. At this point it would becrucial to identify unquarantined infecteds more efficiently inorder to completely shut down the transmission process. Dueto potential difficulties in upholding the containment policiesfor such an extended period of time, we expect that ourpredictions will underestimate the final total amount of confirmedcases.V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONIn summary, we find that one of the key features of thedynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province but alsoin all other provinces is the robust sub-exponential rise in thenumber of confirmed cases according to the scaling law tduring the first episode of the epidemic. This general, almostuniversal behavior is evidence that fundamental principles areat work associated with this particular epidemic that aredominated by the interplay of the contagion process withendogeneous behavioral changes in the susceptible population andexternal mitigation policies. We find that the generic scalingof case counts with time is independent of many other factorsthat often shape the time-course of an epidemic.The model defined by Eqs. (1)-(3) and discussed hereindicates that this type of behavior can generally be expectedif the supply of susceptible individuals is systematicallydecreased by means of implemented containment strategies orbehavioral changes in response to information about theongoing epidemic. Unlike contagion processes that developwithout external interference at all or processes that merely leadto parametric changes in the dynamics, our analysis suggeststhat non-exponential growth is expected when the supply ofsusceptibles is depleted on a timescale comparable to theinfectious period assiociated with the infection. The effectivedepletion of the susceptible populations on a timescale 0 1 inthe model does not imply that the pool of susceptibles mustbe depleted in a physical sense. Rather, this depletion couldbe achieved indirectly.Containment that targets the susceptible population is arequirement for the observed algebraic scaling of case countswith time, unlike the reduction of transmission rates, or thereduction of the duration infected individuals remain infectious.Both of the latter measures address infected individuals only,which leads to a reduction of the exponential growth rate ofnew infections, or an exponential decay if the correspondingmeasures are sufficiently effective, but do not alter thefunctional growth behavior.The fact that scaling laws were observed in Hubei after aninitial exponential phase and that an exponential phase wasnot observed in the other substantially affected provinces isconsistent with the model predictions if one assumes that theresponse in the population and the effect of policies lagged theonset of the epidemic in Hubei province and was immediatein all other provinces that were in an alert status already whencases were increasing substantially in Hubei province.The model reproduces the empirical case counts in allprovinces well for plausible parameter values. The quality ofthe reproduction of the case counts in all 29 affected provincescan be used to estimate the peak time of the number ofasymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic infected individuals in thepopulation, which is the key quantity for estimating the time whenthis outbreak will wane. The current analysis indicates thatthis peak time was reached around Feb. 7th for Hubei andwithin the first days of February in the remaining affectedprovinces.The model further suggests that the public response to theepidemic and the containment measures put in place by the6Chinese administration were effective despite the increase inconfirmed cases. That this behavior was universally observedin all provinces also indicates that mitigation strategies wereuniversally effective. Based on our analysis, we argue that theimplemented containment strategies should stay in effect fora longer time than the incubation period after the saturation inconfirmed cases sets in for this particular outbreak.Our analysis further implies and provides evidence thatmitigation strategies that target the susceptible population andinduce behavioral changes at this \u201cend\u201d of the transmissionprocess are most effective to contain an epidemic\u2014especially insituations when asymptomatic or mildly symptomaticinfectious periods are long or their duration unknown. This may beof importance for developing containment strategies in futurescenarios or if the current COVID-19 epidemic were to triggerlarge scale outbreaks in other regions of the world by exportsand subsequent proliferation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe want to express our gratitude to L.

We fixed the epidemiologicalparameters to duration of infection TI = 8 d and basic reproductionnumber R0;free = TI = 6:2. The population size N of each ofthe affected Chinese provinces was obtained from theGeonames project [        We find that the model accurately reflects both thesubexponential growth as well as the saturating behaviorobserved in the data discussed in the main text, with theobtained fit parameters displayed in Tab. I. For the 9 majorlyaffected provinces and the aggregated data over all provincesexcept Hubei, the quarantine probability is found to havesimilar values of Q = 0:6 0:1. The public containmentleverage is fluctuating more strongly with values ranging betweenP = 0:07 and P = 1, where generally, lower values appearconcurrently with a higher quarantine probability, which suggeststhat stronger quarantine implementation requires less publicisolation. Yet, we advise not to overinterpret the values ofthese fit parameters, as many different parameter valuesgenerate similar developments of confirmed cases.As we fixed the population size to be equal to the totalpopulation of the respective provinces, one might also ask howsystem size changes the results\u2014for instance, if the outbreakis contained in a small region of a province, the effectivepopulation available to the transmission process will besubstantially smaller. Therefore, we repeated the fit procedure withN as a free fit parameter to find that the form of X \u00b9t\u00ba is notaltered substantially for different values of N , while I\u00b9t\u00ba canvary more strongly as reflected by a larger variation in I0.This result suggests that the estimation of the number ofinfecteds is associated with a larger uncertainty. The generalshape of I\u00b9t\u00ba, however, remains stable such that an inferenceof the peak time of unidentified infecteds is reasonable.Furthermore, the model favours larger values of the containmentrate 0 for larger population sizes in order to reproduceemprical data. This is a reasonable because the number of availabletransmission pathways grows quadratically with thepopulation size, making it easier for the disease to spread faster. Inorder to still observe sub-exponential growth, a large part ofthe susceptible population has to be removed quickly.Consistently, we find that a decay of susceptibles is necessary toreliably obtain the observed growth behavior (i.e. P > 0, 0 > 0).Concerning variation in the fixed model parameters, largervalues of up to R0;free = 12 yield results similar to the onesdescribed above when adjusting the infectious period TI to largervalues, as well. For lower values of R0;free < 6, the model failsto reproduce the scaling laws observed in the data. Similarly,the fit results are reasonably robust against variations of theduration of infection in a range of TI 2 \u00bb6 d; 20 d\u00bc withconcurrent adjustment of R0;free.Similar effects are found for the remaining 20 affectedprovinces for which model fits are displayed in Fig. 3 withparameters given in Tab. II. In general, provinces with largervalues of public containment leverage P exhibit a strongeragreement with the hypothesis of algebraic growth.        All data and the analysis material is available online [        In a typical outbreak scenario only few people are infectedinitially, such that S\u00b90\u00ba = 1 \" and I\u00b90\u00ba = with \" 1,which implies that the depletion of susceptibles available tothe transmission process will be dominated by shutdownpolicies. This assumption effectively linearizes Eq. (1), yieldingthe solutionS\u00b9t\u00ba = exp\u00b9Further integration of the linearized Eq. (2) yieldsI\u00b9t\u00ba = I0 exp \u00bb \u00b9 ++ 0\u00bat\u00bcexpHere, the first factor implies that quarantining infectedsmerely decreases the rate with which their number will growexponentially, while the second term suppresses the wholetransmission process well enough to alter the growthbehavior. This implies that public shutdown policies facilitateepidemic containment in a more effective way than quarantinemeasures.Appendix C: Case confirmation without quarantineIn an alternative approach to the one discussed in the maintext one may assume that isolation affects all citizens equally,i.e. = 0, but that the confirmation and counting of a newcase is decoupled from whether the respective person isquarantined or not\u2014rather, an infected is discovered and countedat rate \u02dc. This implies an ODE system of0S0 I(C1)(C2)(C3)where as before, X will be equal to the number of confirmedcases C.A numerical investigation of this alternative model showsthat confirmed case data can be reasonably fit for allprovinces, as well, which confirms the argumentation ofApp. B that removal of susceptibles from the transmissionprocess is more effective than quarantine in mitigatingepidemic spread.", "ref_list": [[], ["Scientists are racing to model the next moves of a coronavirus that's still hard to predict"], ["Here's How Computer Models Simulate the Future Spread of New Coronavirus"], ["China's Citywide Quarantines: Are They Ethical"], [""], ["Jia'an Xia, Ting Yu, Xinxin Zhang, and Li Zhang.
