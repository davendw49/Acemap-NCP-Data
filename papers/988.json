In Nepal, as of February 20, only one positive case3has been identified among 212 tested.SARS, in 2003, spread both within a geographical region and, more significantly, to different4cities from a single location, through infected travelers. The air-travel frequency from major5cities in China to Nepal is lower compared to that of other countries. However, there are otherfactors to consider. Firstly, Nepal is an emerging tourist destination and 2020 has been declared\u201cVisit Nepal\u201d year with an expected 500,000 tourists.

Furthermore, Nepal shares northern border with China with several border crossingThus, the potential for the spread of COVID-19 through travel and the overlap between themonths of peak tourist season in Nepal and the months of the emergence of the epidemic couldpose a risk to Nepal.Dow3and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) in Kathmandu on January 13.

Any person with fever (>100\u00b0F), cough or shortness ofbreath are referred to STIDH. However, the sensitivity of such screening has not been assessed10and its effectiveness could be reduced by asymptomatic cases. To curb this issue, focus couldbe diverted towards improving awareness among travelers about the symptoms of COVID-19and the algorithm to follow thereafter.A network of 5 hub and several satellite hospitals has been mobilized in Kathmandu.
