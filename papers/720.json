As of 20 Feb 2020, a totalof 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causedby SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore theepidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infectedmedical staff.Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infectedmedical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb,2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based onduration of symptoms: group 1 (\u226410 days) and group 2 (>10 days). Epidemiologicaland clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plotwas used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression modelwas utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge.Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% werefemale and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesalemarket or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%)as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) wasthe most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The mediantime interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission,80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia.Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), septal/subpleural (80%) andground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred tointensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass2index (BMI) (\u2265 24 kg/m ) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87)were unfavorable factors for discharge.Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relativelymilder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to theirmedical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence offever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge formedical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns ofSARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.Prognosis          In December, 2019, a group of novel atypical pneumonia patients with uncertainetiology but mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market emerged inWuhan, China [                    By 11 Feb 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the SARS-Cov-2 hascaused more than 40,000 laboratory confirmed cases and 1,023 deaths among them inChina [12]. Sufficient evidence indicated that the COVID-19 clustered withinclose-contact human groups, such as family and hospital settings [          Information pointing to the epidemiology and clinical features of general confirmedcases has been accumulating. The previous studies enrolling 41, 99 and 138confirmed cases admitted to          Wuhan, respectively, provided an insight intoepidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatment measures andclinical outcomes of these patients [          Despite the increased attention towards protecting medical staff from infection,information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of medical staffconfirmed with COVID-19 is scarce. This single-centered, retrospective study aimedto describe epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiographic features, treatment,and prognosis of a group of medical staff confirmed with COVID-19 who wereadmitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan. We hope the findings in the present study willprovide an insight into the prevention and treatment of this novel coronavirus for theglobal community.            Weperformedasingle-centered, retrospectivestudyonagroupofnovel coronavirus-infected medical staff at Wuhan Union Hospital, one of thehospitals treating patients confirmed with COVID-19 at the earliest time. Diagnosis ofcases with SARS-Cov-2 infection conforms to the WHO interim guidance [7]. Detailsregarding laboratory confirmation protocol for SARS-CoV-2 were described byprevious studies [            This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics of Committees of Union Hospital,Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Writteninformed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.The epidemiological data, medical and nursing records, laboratory examinations,chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were reviewed and abstracted withconcerted efforts of experienced clinicians. Data were collected at the time ofsymptoms onset, presentation for medical advice and in-patient admission. Theclinicians who had experience of treating patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2infection reviewed and collected the medical records of patients, and preliminarilycollated the data. The clinical data were extracted through a standardized form forcase report as previously described [23]. Epidemiological data, including exposurehistories before symptoms onset (whether there is a history of exposure to the HuananSeafood Wholesale Market, or wildlife), and close contact with laboratory-confirmedor suspected cases of COVID-19 in a work environment (fever clinics, or isolationwards), specimens (pharyngeal swab, blood, sputum specimens, etc.) or familymembers with COVID-19 were collected. In addition, information about preventivemedication among medical staff was also collected.We have also collected the data on demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratoryexaminations and radiological studies. These included age, sex, occupation (doctor, ornurse), body mass index (BMI \u226524, or <24 kg/m2), current smoking status (yes, or no),disease severity (non-severe, or severe), date of symptom onset, symptoms beforehospital admission (fever, cough, fatigue, sore throat, myalgia, sputum production,difficulty breathing or chest tightness, chill, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and chest pain),coexisting conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, etc.), laboratory testing indicatorson admission (leucocyte count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, D-dimer, creatinine,creatinekinase, lactosedehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartateaminotransferase, hemoglobin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, Amyloid A, total bilirubin,procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocytesubsets, etc.), radiologic assessments of chest CT (lung involvement, lung lobeinvolvement, predominant CT changes, predominant distribution of opacities, etc.),treatment measures (antibiotics agents, antiviral agents, traditional Chinese medicine,immune globulin, thymosin, corticosteroids and oxygen therapy), and complications(e.g. pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, acutekidney injury, shock, etc.). All CT images were analyzed by two radiologists (J.L. andF.Y., who had 5 and 21 years of experience in thoracic radiology, respectively)utilizing the institutional digital database system without access to clinical andlaboratory findings. Images were reviewed independently, and final decisions werereached by discussion and consensus. We estimated the time interval from symptomonset to admission with maximum information available - that is, all the exact date ofinitial symptoms provided by the patients. Then the aggregated data was sent to dataanalysis group. Prior to statistical analysis, the aggregated data were cross - checkedby group members to guarantee the correctness and completeness of data.The clinical outcomes and prognosis were continuously observed up to 24 Feb 2020.We defined the primary outcomes as discharge. The discharge criteria of inpatientsincluded all the following three conditions [24]: (1) body temperature return to normalfor more than 3 days and respiratory symptoms improvement; (2) resolution of lunginvolvement demonstrated by chest CT; (3) two consecutive RT-RCR tests, withsampling interval of more than 1 day, showing a negative result. Secondary outcomesconsisted of hospital discharge rate and length of hospital stay. Given that treatmentand monitoring of some patients in our study were still ongoing, a fixed time-intervalof observation was not applied to these clinical outcomes.            This study devoted to report the epidemiological, clinical characteristics andprognosis of medical staff confirmed with COVID-19. Continuous variables werechecked for distribution normality by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,following which they were summarized as either means with standard deviations (SD)or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Counts and percentageswere utilized to describe categorical variables. Given the cut-off point at 10th day ofsymptoms onset proposed by previous studies [            Statistical tests were two-sided with significance set at \u03b1 less than 0.05. We performedall data analyses by R software version 3.6.2 (RDuring the study period, epidemiological and clinical data were collected on 64medical staff with laboratory-confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection from Wuhan UnionHospital, of whom 62 (97%) provided an exact date of symptom onset and only 1 case(2%) was severe. The patients aged between 23 and 63 years old, and median age was35 years (IQR 29-43 years). The median age in group 1 was 37 years (IQR 32-44years), and in group 2 it was 30 years (IQR 27-36 years). More than half of the cohortwere female (64%) and nurse (67%). There were 7 (11%) overweight cases (BMI \u226524 kg/m2) and only 1 was current smoker.Among the 64 medical staff recruited, no one had an exposure to Huanan seafoodwholesale market or wildlife, while 4 (6%) medical staff had family membersconfirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. During patient care, 5 (8%) and 3 (5%) caseshad contact with patients in fever clinics and isolation wards, respectively, and 3 (5%)had direct contact with specimens collected from confirmed patients. 10 (16%) of 64medical staff have used preventive medications (Table 1).The median duration between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 (IQR 4.3-15.0)days of the entire cohort; 5.0 (IQR 3.0-7.0) days in group 1 and 18.0 (IQR 14.0-24.0)days in group 2. There were 8 (13%) cases, most of whom were assigned to group 1,with one or more co-morbidities: 3 (5%) had hypertension, 2 (3%) had uterinefibroids, and one (2%) each had diabetes, depressive disorder, thyroid nodules orabdominal lymphatic tuberculosis. The three most common symptoms were fever(67%), cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The relatively less common symptoms weresore throat, myalgia, difficulty breathing or chest tightness, sputum production,headache, chill, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and chest pain (Table 1).Table 2 shows the laboratory and radiographic findings of 64 medical staff withconfirmed COVID-19. On admission, the blood counts of 11 (17%) cases showedleukocytopenia and only one (2%) showed leukocytosis. 22 (34%) presented withlymphocytopenia and 7 (11%) presented thrombocytopenia. Most cases demonstratednormal levels of D-dimer, creatinine, and creatine kinase, but elevated C-reactiveprotein and amyloid A levels were presented in 45% and 59% of cases, respectively.Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (13%) and aspartate aminotransferase(9%) were less common. A small proportion (3%) of cases had abnormalprocalcitonin serum level (>0.5 ug/L). Notably, 47 (80%) of cases had high levels ofIL-6 (>2.9 pg/ml). Medical staff of group 1 had more prominent laboratoryabnormalities (i.e., leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelet, alanine aminotransferase,amyloid A and IL-6) as compared with those in group 2.As evidenced by Table 2 which illustrate the radiological findings in the study cohorton chest CT, 58 (91%) of 64 cases showed abnormalities (Figure 1). 39 (61%) hadbilateral lung involvement (Figure 1, A and C). The right lower lobe (70 %) and leftlower lobe (64%) were the most common involved lobes. Ground glass opacity wasregarded as the predominant abnormality on chest CT (Figure 1, A and B) observed in33 (52%) of cases, meanwhile subpleural distribution was predominant as identifiedin 51 (80%) (Figure 1, C). Thickening of the adjacent pleura, nodules, emphysema,pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were relatively rare. CT scans also found that19 (30%) of medical staff had one or more chronic lung lesions with a static pictureon serial CT examinations (Figure 1, D).Of the study participants, no person was transferred to an intensive care unit formechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 9 (14%) patientsneeded an electrocardiograph monitoring, among whom 8 were in group 1. Empiricalintravenous antibiotic treatment was administered in 55 (86%) patients. All thepatients were given empirical antiviral therapy. Meanwhile, 13 (20%) were offeredtraditional Chinese medicine, 23 (36%) patients were given immune globulin, 33(52%) were given thymosin, and 7 (11%) received corticosteroids. As for oxygentherapy, 32 (50%) used nasal cannula and only 2 (3%) used face mask, while no oneneeded invasive mechanical or ventilation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Asa whole, despite the negligible difference of antiviral treatment between two groups,most of the cases who received electrocardiogram monitoring, antibiotics, immuneglobulin, thymosin and oxygen therapy belonged to group 1, whereas the proportiongiven traditional Chinese medicine was higher in group 2 (Table 3).By 24 Feb, 2020, 34 (53%) of the cases have been discharged and none had died, theremaining cases were still in hospital to receive supportive therapy. The median lengthof hospital stay was 12.5 (IQR 9.0-19.8) days in total, 18.0 (IQR 13.0-20.5) days ingroup 1 and 9.0 (IQR 6.0-11.0) days in group 2 (Table 3). The overall mediandischarge time (i.e. equal to the time that half of the patients left the hospital) was 20days (Figure 2A).It should be noted that the endpoint of Cox model was discharge, and patients whocontinued to be hospitalized as of 24 Feb 2020 would be regarded as censored data.The HR metric derived from multivariate Cox regression model was utilized toascertain factors significantly associated with the endpoint of patients infected withSARS-CoV-2. Results of the final multivariate Cox regression model showed that2larger BMI (\u2265 24 kg/m ) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever symptoms (HR 0.24;95% CI 0.09-0.60) and increased IL-6 levels (> 2.9 pg/ml) on admission (HR 0.31;95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for hospital discharge (all HRs <1 and allP-values <0.05) according to Cox regression mode (Figure 2B).By 20 Feb, 2020, 476 hospitals across China had reported, in total, 2,055laboratory-confirmed cases of medical staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which themajority (88%) were from Hubei province [25]. According to China-WHO jointinvestigation report, most of the infections among medical staff occurred in the earlystages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, when there was a lack of knowledgeabout transmission approaches and experience to fight with the SARS-CoV-2 [25].Despite the outbreak of COVID-19 occurring in few scattered hospitals (e.g. 15medical staff were infected at one hospital in Wuhan), hospital-related transmission isnot the main transmission feature of COVID-19 in China [25]. Our findings advocatethis viewpoint. According to our data, a small proportion of 64 novelcoronavirus-infected medical staff had a direct contact with specimens of patients (5%)as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%) during patient care.In addition, none of the 64 medical staff had an exposure to Huanan seafood marketor wildlife, and 4 (6%) had family members with confirmed COVID-19. The exactmode of medical staff infection remains unclear. The findings are consistent withprevious reports [12, 25].            The demographic characteristics and clinical manifestations of medical staff withconfirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan were not exactly the same as general confirmedpatients included in recent studies [            In our study, only one of 64 medical staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection was severecase, none developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or transferred to intensivecare unit. More than half of the cases were discharged by 24 Feb, 2020. Previousstudies suggested that 13.8% of the general confirmed patients were severe cases,among whom older age, male sex, chronic diseases are more common [25, 31, 32, 33].Contrarily, our study revealed that medical staff have relatively milder symptoms,which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlyingdiseases.            Medical staff with symptoms onset for less than 10 days by the time of admissionwere compared with those with symptoms of more than 10 days. We found thatmedical staff with symptoms for less than 10 days had more prominent laboratoryabnormalities on admission, and they also experienced relatively worse clinical courseand longer hospital stay. Furthermore, the median time between symptoms onset andadmission of infected medical staff in this study was 8.5 days, longer than generalpopulation as described in recent publications [                        Predictors of hospital discharge among infected medical staff were identified by Coxmodel. Smaller BMI, absence of fever and normal levels of IL-6 on initial stage werefavorable factors for recovery and discharge. A recent study revealed that fever wasidentified in only half of the patients on presentation but increased to nearly 90% afterhospitalization [            Given that epidemiology and clinical features of medical staff infected withSARS-CoV-2 is unclear, our study provides an insight to prevention and treatment ofmedical staff at risk of COVID-19 infection. So far, more than 40,000 medicalpersonnel outside Hubei province gathered in Wuhan for the battle against theepidemic, and China has attached great importance to infection prevention amongmedical staff [25]. Although some safeguards have been introduced in the aspectsincluding salary, injury suffered on the job, rest, and psychological adjustment formedical staff, the next step will continue to strengthen the promotion of thesemeasures. Meanwhile, some potential problems remain to be solved, such as unclearpatterns of infection, mental health care for medical staff [36], and the possibility ofairborne transmission from aerosol production by medical practices in health carefacilities [25]. A recent study from Singapore found that surface environmental andpersonal protective equipment contamination caused by respiratory droplets and fecalshedding from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the environment isa potential viral vector [37]. Further investigations should be devoted to identifyingthe exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff.We acknowledge some limitations of this study. First, only 64 for medical staff withconfirmed COVID-19 from a single hospital in Wuhan were included. However, thepopulation from which they were sampled was large and we did not include all of thecases during the study period. In fact, there are 2,055 laboratory-confirmed cases ofCOVID-19 in medical staff as of 20 Feb 2020 [25]. This limitation in our study mayresult in deviations in epidemiological and clinical observation characteristics. Wehope that the findings presented here will encourage a more comprehensiveassessment of SARS-Cov-2 infection in for medical staff. Second, more detailedinformation, particularly regarding specific causes of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongfor medical staff, was unavailable at the time of analysis; however, this is aretrospective, observational study and the data used in this study only provide apreliminary insight into epidemiological features and clinical outcomes of a group offor medical staff confirmed with COVID-19. Further research on this regard isneeded.The study medical staff have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course,which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlyingdiseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels onadmission are favorable for recovery and hospital discharge for medical staff infectedwith COVID-19. Further investigations should be devoted to identifying the exactmode of COVID-19 among medical staff.J.L., L.OY. and C.S.Z. conceptualized the article.

We sought to explore theepidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infectedmedical staff. Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. Fever (67%) wasthe most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relativelymilder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to theirmedical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Writteninformed consent was waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease. In addition, information about preventivemedication among medical staff was also collected. Secondary outcomesconsisted of hospital discharge rate and length of hospital stay. More than half of the cohortwere female (64%) and nurse (67%). Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (13%) and aspartate aminotransferase(9%) were less common. Medical staff of group 1 had more prominent laboratoryabnormalities (i.e., leukocytes, lymphocytes, platelet, alanine aminotransferase,amyloid A and IL-6) as compared with those in group 2.As evidenced by Table 2 which illustrate the radiological findings in the study cohorton chest CT, 58 (91%) of 64 cases showed abnormalities (Figure 1). Empiricalintravenous antibiotic treatment was administered in 55 (86%) patients. Meanwhile, 13 (20%) were offeredtraditional Chinese medicine, 23 (36%) patients were given immune globulin, 33(52%) were given thymosin, and 7 (11%) received corticosteroids. The overall mediandischarge time (i.e. equal to the time that half of the patients left the hospital) was 20days (Figure 2A).It should be noted that the endpoint of Cox model was discharge, and patients whocontinued to be hospitalized as of 24 Feb 2020 would be regarded as censored data. Medical staff with symptoms onset for less than 10 days by the time of admissionwere compared with those with symptoms of more than 10 days. A recent study revealed that fever wasidentified in only half of the patients on presentation but increased to nearly 90% afterhospitalization [            Given that epidemiology and clinical features of medical staff infected withSARS-CoV-2 is unclear, our study provides an insight to prevention and treatment ofmedical staff at risk of COVID-19 infection. First, only 64 for medical staff withconfirmed COVID-19 from a single hospital in Wuhan were included. However, thepopulation from which they were sampled was large and we did not include all of thecases during the study period. The study medical staff have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course,which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlyingdiseases. Further investigations should be devoted to identifying the exactmode of COVID-19 among medical staff. J.L., L.OY.,P.G., H.S.W. and Y.L.C. cleaned and analyzed the data.
