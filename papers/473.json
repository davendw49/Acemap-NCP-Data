Meanwhile, theconclusions have caused a certaindegree of social panic.Huang and colleagues1 only included59 suspected cases with fever and drycough, and 41 patients were conrfimedto be infected with SARS-CoV-2.They concluded that SARS-CoV-2infection was associated with a highrate of admission to intensive careunits (13 [32%] of 41 patients) andmortality (six [15%] of 41 patients);however, we believe these conclusionswere inaccurate and misleading.Case fatality ratio should notbe confused with mortality rate.Case fatality rate is defined as theproportion of people who die of acertain disease; however, mortalityrate usually reflects the death ratein an entire population.2 The casefatality rate is therefore approximately15% in the study population,1 but thisestimate is also inaccurate since casedetection is highly biased towards themore severe cases in the early stages.3In fact, a large number of mild andasymptomatic patients might notreceive timely diagnosis or health care,which can conceal the real incidenceand allow disease progression.Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infectionare presenting with a wide rangeof symptoms. Most patients seemto have mild disease, and about20% appear to progress to severedisease, including pneumonia,respiratory failure, and, in some cases,even death.4 As of Feb 12, 2020,WHO4 reports that 45 171 people havebeen diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2worldwide, and 44 730 of these casesare in China.4 Of the confirmed casesin China, 8204 (18%) cases wererecorded as severe infections, and1114 (2%) patients died, which is alower case fatality rate than previouslyreported.4,5 The case fatality rate forCOVID-19 reported by Huang andcolleagues1 could be misunderstood,and detection bias should not beneglected.We declare no competing interests.", "ref_list": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "Chaolin Huang and colleagues1\nfirst reported the clinical features\nof patients infected with severe\nacute respiratory syndrome corona\nvirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously\nknown as 2019-nCoV), which\nemerged in Wuhan, China.
