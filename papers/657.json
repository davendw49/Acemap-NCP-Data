Human population movement playsan important role in the spread of infectious diseases. Although China has served as theepicenter of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, real-time phylogenetic analysis [        In addition to the phylogenetic analysis, a number of other circumstantial factorssupport the introduction of the virus to other countries, as it appears more likely that theintroduction of COVID-19 to South America occurred from Italy rather than from China.First, since January 23, 2020, China has increased their containment measures anddecreased the number of outbound international flights. Second, early febrile airportscreening mostly targeted travelers coming from Asia overlooking those from other parts ofthe world \u2013 including travelers from Europe; an approach that turned out to have limitedeffectiveness [7]. Third, as most of the infections by SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic and mild5657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778[8-10], it is more likely that infected carriers could enter a country without being detectedby the temperature screening at the airports. Lastly, Italian Brazilians are the largest groupof foreigners with full or partial Italian ancestry outside Italy, with S\u00e3o Paulo being the mostpopulous city with Italian ancestry in the world. In this paper, we investigated how thegrowing epidemic in Italy affects the spread of the epidemic around the world by usingmeasurements of spatial proximity and travel volume between countries.This study is based on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each country untilMarch 10th, 2020 obtained from World Health Organisation (WHO) situation reports [1] andreal-time online COVID-19 monitoring sites [11, 12]. The air travel data between countrieswere obtained from the Official Airline Guide (OAG) database (www.oag.com). Preliminaryanalysis includes Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis to examine the association between thenumber of COVID-19 cases and travel influx (and arrival time) from the source country.Spatial data reveal the degree of dependency among observations in geographical space[13, 14]; consequently, spatial dependence measures such semi-variogram and LocalIndicator of Spatial Association (LISA) [15] were used to detect spatial patterns in COVID-19data. For the spatial weights, we used Queen-style contiguity 1st order nearest neighbour(i.e., two countries are neighbouring if they share common borders or a point). Additionally,we developed a stochastic meta-population model of global spread using the 2018 IATAflight data for travel volumes between each country. The country-specific compartmentalmodel is an adaptation of the classical SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered)model based on reported dynamics of the novel coronavirus [16, 17] for global spread ofCOVID-19 (see the appendix for model details and www.pandemic.org.au for deterministicversion) [18]. We used the cases on WHO situation report [1] to initialise the number of8081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102people infected in Italy and assuming same for China to determine global risk from thesetwo epicenters under the same initial infection seed. Each country\u2019s risk of importation wasclassified into quartiles: slight risk (<25%), moderate risk (25%-50%), high risk (50%-75%)and extreme risk (>75%).Up until the February 21st Italian outbreak, all reported European cases wereimported from China (Figure 1) [19]. The disease has now (as at March 10th) spread to 46(excluding Vatican City and Liechtenstein) out of the 53 countries within the WHO Europeanregion [1]. Italy has 9,172 confirmed cases and 463 deaths as of March 10th. The regionalone accounted for 46% of the total cases outside of China. There are currently threeCOVID-19 epicenters \u2013China, Italy, and Iran, which are mostly responsible for introducingthe virus globally (Figure 1).We present in Figure 2, the distribution of time elapsed since 21st February when thefirst imported case of COVID-19 from Italy was reported in each country against thegeographical distance from Italy. The outbreak in Italy is highly sporadic in the last threeweeks. While the shortest arrival time (after the Italy outbreak) was 5 days to Austria,Switzerland, Brazil and Algeria, the virus spread to 44 countries within 17 days (median, 11days). The global arrival times for three epicenters from the first reported cases in Wuhan,The Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis (r= -0.43, p=0.004) suggest negative associationbetween disease arrival time and number of cases for cases imported from Italy. That is,countries with shorter introduction time have more number of cases. There was significantassociation between the number of cases and daily travel influx from Italy (r=0.39, p=0.011).The apparent spatial autocorrelation in the COVID cases within Europe (Moran\u2019s104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125Index=0.310, p=<0.001) is also significant (Figure S2). Notably, France and Italy are locatedin the right upper quadrant, while Switzerland, Austria and Slovakia are on the left upperquadrant, indicating a positive and negative spatial autocorrelation pattern respectively.Additionally, semi-variograms indicated spatial autocorrelation of the disease incidenceexists up to a distance of 120 decimal degrees for Italy (Figure S3). Using bivariate LISAanalysis, we found evidence of spatial interaction between COVID-19 cases and arrival timeas well as travel influx (Moran\u2019s I=0.340. This suggests that spatial variations withinEuropean region were non-random, exhibiting effects of neighbouring interactions andtravel influx.We simulated COVID-19 spread comparing two outbreak epicenters \u2013 Italy andChina. Figure 3 shows the relative risk of importation from the two epicenters. The resultsshow that whereas the Asia-Pacific is more at risk (high risk to extreme) from Chinaepicenter, Europe, South-America and Africa are more at risk from the Italian epicenter.High population density and highly interconnected transportation networks connectingtourism hubs in Northern Italy with major European cities have made it extremely difficultto contain and reduce the number of infections. This aligns well with our prediction ofextreme risks of case importations from Italy to other European, while Latin American andAfrican countries have high risks (Figure 3). In the case of Italy, our modelling results couldprovide an argument for the Italian government instituting a national quarantine and travelrestrictions on March 9th, 2020 to mitigate consequent spread of infection. Based on theevidence form the Chinese policies of containment and quarantine that showedconsiderable effectiveness [20], these interventions should slow the spread of the diseasewithin Europe and abroad.127128129130131132133134135136137138139140Although most African countries have focused their COVID-19 surveillance efforts ontravelers from China, our analysis shows that this approach may need to be reconsidered asthe number of cases in Europe soar, making the risk of importation to Africa higher fromEuropean countries than from China through stronger transportation connectivity andmigration flows (especially, with North African countries). As at now, Italy has put itselfunder lockdown [21] and other countries such as Australia and the USA have restrictedflights from Italy [22, 23]. As new epicenters are emerging, countries are required to adaptquickly and adjust their containment measures to reduce the spread of infection.In summary, we estimated the risk of importation from two major epicenters toother countries and showed that spatial proximity and mobility are important factors thatfuel disease importation. This analysis illustrates the potential development of the infectionspread and may be useful in countries\u2019 epidemic preparedness including large-scaleinterventions such as travel restrictions and quarantine.14210.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.World Health Organization.
