Traditional cell-line cultures have been used to study L.\u00a0intracellularis pathogenesis. However, these systems fail to reproduce the epithelial changes observed in the intestines of L.\u00a0intracellularis-infected pigs, specifically, the changes in intestinal cell constitution and gene expression. A\u00a0more physiologically accurate and state-of-the-art model is provided by swine enteroids derived from stem cell-containing crypts from healthy pigs. The objective of this study was to verify the feasibility of two-dimensional swine enteroids as in vitro models for L.\u00a0intracellularis infection. We established both three- and two-dimensional swine enteroid cultures derived from intestinal crypts. The two-dimensional swine enteroids were infected by L.\u00a0intracellularis in four independent experiments. Enteroid-infected samples were collected 3 and 7 d postinfection for analysis using real-time quantitative PCR and L.\u00a0intracellularis immunohistochemistry. In this study, we show that L.\u00a0intracellularis is capable of infecting and replicating intracellularly in two-dimensional swine enteroids derived from ileum. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.

Lawsonia intracellularis, theetiologic agent of PE, is an obligate intracellular pathogenthat replicates in the cytoplasm of intestinal epithelialcells. This infection results in crypt hyperplasia, decreasednumbers of goblet cells, and compromised feed digestionthat leads to poor weight gain in affected pigs (Vannucciet\u00a0 al., 2019). The mechanisms involved in the intestinalepithelium changes caused by L.\u00a0intracellularis infection are Care and Use Committee (1807-36212A).

The crypt suspension was transferred toto control variables. Although single cell cultures are routinely a 15\u00a0mL centrifuge tube and washed with advanced DMEM withused for laboratory propagation of L.\u00a0 intracellularis, they fail in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Corning 35011CV, heat inactivated).reproducing the cellular changes observed in the intestinal The tube was centrifuged for 4\u00a0min at low speed (300\u00d7\u00a0 g) and theepithelium of PE-affected pigs                Swine enteroids obtained from intestinal stem cells have covered with 400\u00a0\u00b5L of Intesticult and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5%been described recently                Enteroids cultured this way still contain all types of intestinal Two-dimensional Swine Enteroid Culturesepithelial cells present in the intestine, with the advantage of Twenty-four hours before the passaging of three-dimensionalhaving an easy-access cell apical membrane, which simplifies enteroids, 6.5\u00a0mm diameter transwell inserts were coated withthe infection process and analyses        L.\u00a0intracellularis            passage (Vannucci et\u00a0al., 2013) was propagated in McCoy mousebifroblast cells (ATCC CRL-1696) as described elsewhere            Lawsonia intracellularis real-time polymerase chain reaction(real-time PCR) was performed as described (Wattanaphansaket\u00a0al., 2010) using an aliquot of the inoculum from each of the fourindependent infection experiments (E1 to E4) as PCR template. Ctvalues were converted to L.\u00a0intracellularis organisms/mL, obtaining1.99\u00a0 \u00d7 103 L.\u00a0 intracellularis/mL for experiment 1 (E1), 9.72\u00a0 \u00d7 102L.\u00a0 intracellularis/mL for E2, 1.04\u00a0 \u00d7 107 L.\u00a0 intracellularis/mL for E3,and 5.49\u00a0 \u00d7 104 L.\u00a0 intracellularis/mL for E4. In each independentexperiment, wells were infected withL.\u00a0intracellularis suspension,or exposed to the medium used to suspend the inoculum onlyas negative controls. One set of wells was harvested at 3\u00a0 dayspostinfection (dpi) and another set was harvested at 7 dpi. Theenteroid media collected from the top of the transwell at 3 and7 dpi was saved for L.\u00a0 intracellularis real-time PCR. The set oftranswells to be harvested at 7 dpi had its media replaced at 5 dpi,with the used media also being saved for L.\u00a0intracellularis real-timePCR. This procedure resulted in three samples for L.\u00a0intracellularisreal-time PCR (3, 5, and 7 dpi) for each independent experiment asdescribed elsewhere (Wattanaphansak et\u00a0al., 2010).          with L.\u00a0intracellularisAfter removing the media from the transwell insert,twodimensional swine enteroids were fixed for 2\u00a0 h with 150 and500\u00a0 \u00b5L of 4% formaldehyde in the insert and bottom well,respectively. After fixation, the two-dimensional enteroids werewashed two times with 200\u00a0\u00b5L of PBS. The membranes werethen cautiously removed with a scalpel blade, placed on biopsymolds and covered with Histogel. Histogel blocks for thetwodimensional swine enteroids were stored in 70% ethanol at roomtemperature until routine processing and paraffin embeddingwas done. Paraffin-embedded blocks were cut into 4\u00a0 \u00b5m thicksections and placed on charged glass slides and were used forimmunohistochemistry for detection of L.\u00a0intracellularis          Lawsonia intracellularis propagates intwo-dimensional swine enteroidsof L.\u00a0intracellularis (1.99\u00a0\u00d7 103 L.\u00a0intracellularis/mL and 9.72\u00a0 \u00d7 102L.\u00a0intracellularis/mL, respectively) and real time-PCR results werenegative for the media samples in all time points, indicatingnondetectable levels of L.\u00a0intracellularis propagation. E3 receivedthe highest inoculum concentration (1.04\u00d7\u00a0 107 L.\u00a0intracellularis/mL) and E4 received an intermediate amount of bacteria (5.49\u00d7\u00a0104 L.\u00a0intracellularis/mL). Media collected from the samples of E3and E4 were positive by real time-PCR for L.\u00a0intracellularis at 3, 5,and 7 dpi (Figure\u00a01), indicating that L.\u00a0intracellularis propagatedin the two-dimensional swine enteroids. Importantly, forboth E3 and E4, there was an increase in the L.\u00a0 intracellularisconcentration in the media with time. Bacterial propagationwas further demonstrated by the detection of L.\u00a0intracellularis inthe media collected at 7 dpi, since the media was completelyreplaced at 5 dpi and any bacteria detected at 7 dpi would be dueto the release of bacterial organisms propagating in the cells tothe medium between 5 and 7\u00a0dpi.The presence of L.\u00a0 intracellularis in the cytoplasm of swineenteroid cells was detected by immunohistochemistry insamples from E1, E3, and E4 but not in samples from E2(inoculated with the lowest concentration of L.\u00a0 intracellularis).The highest amount of L.\u00a0intracellularis antigen in the cytoplasmof swine enteroid cells was observed in samples from E3, inaccordance with the higher numbers of organisms obtained byL.\u00a0intracellularis real-time PCR. High amounts of L.\u00a0intracellularisantigen in the cytoplasm were observed both at 3 and 7 dpi insamples from E3, suggesting that L.\u00a0 intracellularis inoculum inhigh concentration might be necessary for effective bacterialpropagation.          cell lines, such as Caco-2, IPEC-J2 and IEC-18 do not increaseproliferation when infected by L.\u00a0 intracellularis                    When L.\u00a0intracellularis is interacting with the host intestinalepithelium in vivo, there is hyperplasia of the intestinalcrypts          Swine enteroids have numerous advantages as in vitro modelsto investigate host pathogen interactions over other cell andtissue culture models. The feasibility of maintaining the enteroidculture in laboratory conditions decreases the need for euthanasiaof numerous animals to provide intestinal samples. Additionally,culturing swine enteroids without cell immortalization orgenetic modicfiation for high cellular proliferation allows for theassessment of the different signaling pathways of the epithelialcells affected by L.\u00a0intracellularis infection.          The incubation period for L.\u00a0intracellularis infection in pigsin vivo is about 11\u00a0days          Our study provides proof-of-concept that swine enteroidsallow L.\u00a0 intracellularis infection and propagation. We anticipatefuture studies that will assess the utility of two-dimensionalswine enteroids as revolutionary models for the evaluation ofnovel therapeutics, vaccine candidates, and host\u2013pathogeninteractions involved during infection by L.\u00a0 intracellularis,accelerating the advancement of interventional strategiesagainst this important pathogen in the swine industry.", "ref_list": [[], ["Lawsonia intracellularis infection of intestinal crypt cells is associated with specific depletion of secreted MUC2 in goblet cells"], ["From 3D organoids back to 2D enteroids"], ["Dietary fiber sources and non-starch polysaccharide-degrading enzymes modify mucin expression and the immune profile of the swine ileum"], ["Cell lineage identification and stem cell culture in a porcine model for the study of intestinal epithelial regeneration"], ["Archibald, mucosa homogenate and pure culture of the homologous T"], ["049 characterization of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies Sato"], ["Lawsonia intracellularis"], ["Identifying obstacles to reducing the use of antibiotics Vannucci"], ["Kar, the experimental reproduction of porcine proliferative Z"], ["Characterization of porcine in understanding the pathogenesis of Lawsonia intestinal enteroid cultures under a lipopolysaccharide intracellularis infections"], ["Porcine intestinal enteroids: a new model for enteropathy"], ["Field evaluation of an oral Vannucci"], ["Development of a polymerase chain reaction assay for Salces, and C.\u00a0Gebhart. 2019a.
