Structure-based phylogenetic analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing this challenge, allowing the detection and quantification of conserved architectural properties between proteins, including those with low or no detectable sequence homology. With a focus on viral protein structure, we highlight how a number of investigations have utilized this powerful method to infer common functionality and ancestry.", "text": "        Global genome sequencing initiatives have delivered abundantinsights into the expansive viral biosphere                Comparison of viral protein structures constitutes animportant consideration when establishing the relatedness of proteinsfrom genetically distinct viruses. When combined with modernsequence-based approaches                SBPA relies on the availability of medium-to-high resolution(typically higher than 3 A\u02da ) structures, which can be compared ina pairwise manner to generate structural distances. Over thepast decades, numerous tools have been developed todetermine similarities between three-dimensional proteinstructures, including but not limited to HOMOLOGY (Rao andRossmann 1973), Structural Homology Program (SHP)                A pairwise structural alignment involves establishing thedegree of equivalence between two superimposed structures.Conventionally, a measure of the root-mean-square distancebetween the corresponding Ca atoms of a pair of superimposedprotein structures has been used to define structural similarity                Following pairwise structural alignments, HSF and MUSTANG(but not SHP) perform hierarchical categorization in a step termed\u2018classification\u2019. In HSF (Ravantti, Bamford, and Stuart 2013), theinitial set of equivalent residues identified by pairwisecomparison forms a common structural core between the two structures.Comparison of similarities between structural cores establishedfrom all of the pairwise alignments generates new combinedcores (i.e. new sets of equivalent residues), which willsubsequently be used to repeat this recursive alignment process untilthe pool of input structures under comparison is diminished. Aseach class grows to encompass more closely related structures, afull hierarchical classification is generated. Similarly,residue\u2013residue similarity scores are generated by comparison of equivalentcontiguous structural cores within MUSTANG                Finally, the relatedness of protein structures can becalculated quantitatively and plotted as an unrooted tree (ofunknown origin), reflecting the distances (branch length)between protein structures. SHP, MUSTANG, and HSF calculateso-called \u2018evolutionary distances\u2019 from similarity scores orprobabilities of equivalence, as detailed in Bamford, Grimes,and Stuart (2005; SHP), Konagurthu et al. (2006; MUSTANG), andRavantti, Bamford, and Stuart (2013; HSF). Subsequently,structure-based phylogenetic trees can be plotted from distancematrices and visualized using packages such as PHYLIP(Felsenstein 1989) and Dendroscope        While it is important not to discount the potential effects ofstructural determination (e.g. crystal packing) or inherentprotein features (structural plasticity/flexibility) upon thecalculation of these trees and the conclusions that can be drawn, inthe following sections, we demonstrate how SBPA has beensuccessfully used to relate commonalities in origin and functionfor several well-studied protein folds (Fig. 1).        The identification of novel viruses continues to expand ourappreciation of the virosphere, revealing a seemingly endlessbreadth of genomic diversity                The recent structural determination of the MCP from thessDNA Flavobacterium-infecting, lipid-containing phage (FLiP)        These results demonstrate the power of complementarystructure- and sequence-based approaches in drawing evolutionarylinks between diverse viruses.        The identification of shared structural and functionalproperties (e.g. common mode of capsid assembly and genomereplication, respectively) across distinct MCP-bearing DNA virusessupports the existence of a common ancestor for the doublejelly roll-MCP of PRD1\u2013adenovirus members                The canonical six-bladed b-propeller fold is arranged as sixb-sheets, each comprising four anti-parallel strands organizedaround a central axis (Fig. 1C). Previous studies havedemonstrated that SBPA of proteins exhibiting this six-bladedb-propeller fold results in the bifurcation of viral and non-viralgroups                Analogous to the split observed upon SBPA of viral andnonviral six-bladed b-propeller folds (Fig. 2A), SBPA of Bcl-2 andBcl2-like proteins                In addition, SBPA reveals that the structural relationshipbetween poxviral Bcl-2-like proteins echoes their independentlyacquired functions. Indeed, VACV N1, which has bothantiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory functions        As the repertoire of the PDB continues to expand, SBPA has beenproven to be an increasingly useful method for rationalizingdifferences in protein functionality.

This transmission potential is, inpart, facilitated by the ability of the six-bladed b-propellerdomain of the paramyxoviral RBP to productively interact withcell surface receptors that are conserved between differentorganisms                SBPA of known paramyxoviral HN, H, and G RBP structureshas shown that these viral proteins segregate according toreceptor-specificity                In addition, we note that the RBP from the henipavirus,Mo` jiang virus (MojV-G RBP)                The identification of these structurally and functionallydistinct RBPs both highlights the existence of novel host cell entrypathways that may be utilized by pathobiologically diverse4.2 Novel roles for structurally distinct influenza virusglycoproteinsHemagglutinin (HA) (Fig. 1E) and neuraminidase (NA) (Fig. 1C)glycoproteins extend from the envelope surface of influenzavirus and are responsible for negotiating host cell entry andegress, respectively. HA is responsible for both recognizing sialicacid during host cell attachment and facilitating fusion of thehost and viral membranes, while NA is responsible forhydrolyzing sialic acid to free virus progeny from infected cells                The paradigm shifting discovery of the HL17NL10 (HL,hemagglutinin-like; NL, neuraminidase-like) and HL18NL11influenza A viruses from bats in Latin America                While the receptor for HL18 has yet to be reported, the majorhistocompatibility complex class II human leukocyte antigenDR isotype (HLA-DR) has been identified as a receptor requiredfor host cell attachment for HL17                A recent structural study utilized SBPA to classify theconformational states of OW and NW arenaviral GP1glycoproteins and relate the potential physiological roles of thesediscrete structural classes to differential antigenicity                Inspection of the SBPA reveals that the GP1 structures fromNW Machupo virus (MACV), Jun\u0131\u00b4n virus (JUNV), and WhitewaterArroyo virus (WWAV) separate into two branches according torespective clades B and D classification                Strikingly, we note that the GP2-free structure of the GP1glycoprotein from LUJV, a pathogenic OW arenavirus                In light of the expansive genomic diversity revealed by viralsurveillance initiatives                It seems likely that SBPA will continue to play an importantrole in characterizing and rationalizing the pathobiologicalfeatures of newly emerging viruses. Indeed, we have shown thatthis is possible for emerging paramyxoviruses, where thereceptor-binding domain, an important determinant of host celltropism, structurally classifies according to receptor specificity                SBPA can also lead to structure-guided hypotheses ofwhether the glycoproteins displayed by emerging viruses maybe capable of misleading the antibody-mediated immuneresponse through the formation of structural classes that aredistinct from those presented on the mature virion        We thank David Stuart and Peter Simmonds for criticalreading of the manuscript and Ruben Hulswit for helpfuldiscussions.This work was funded by the Medical Research Council (MR/L009528/1 and MR/S007555/1 to T.A.B), Wellcome (203797/Z/16/Z to W.M.N), and the Engineering and Physics ResearchCouncil (EP/K503113/1, EP/L505031/1, EP/M50659X/1, andEP/M508111/1 to A.J.S).

When combined with modernsequence-based approaches                SBPA relies on the availability of medium-to-high resolution(typically higher than 3 A\u02da ) structures, which can be compared ina pairwise manner to generate structural distances. Aseach class grows to encompass more closely related structures, afull hierarchical classification is generated. Similarly,residue\u2013residue similarity scores are generated by comparison of equivalentcontiguous structural cores within MUSTANG                Finally, the relatedness of protein structures can becalculated quantitatively and plotted as an unrooted tree (ofunknown origin), reflecting the distances (branch length)between protein structures. 2006; MUSTANG), andRavantti, Bamford, and Stuart (2013; HSF). Subsequently,structure-based phylogenetic trees can be plotted from distancematrices and visualized using packages such as PHYLIP(Felsenstein 1989) and Dendroscope        While it is important not to discount the potential effects ofstructural determination (e.g. crystal packing) or inherentprotein features (structural plasticity/flexibility) upon thecalculation of these trees and the conclusions that can be drawn, inthe following sections, we demonstrate how SBPA has beensuccessfully used to relate commonalities in origin and functionfor several well-studied protein folds (Fig. 1C)glycoproteins extend from the envelope surface of influenzavirus and are responsible for negotiating host cell entry andegress, respectively.
