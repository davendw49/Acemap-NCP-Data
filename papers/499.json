These involvement in these diseases, with some species viruses have high mutation and gene recombination confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERSrates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution.1 CoV4), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with virus, non-human primates for Ebola virus5), or deadmild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging end hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and novel coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), frequently through animal-based food systems. In the which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus MERS-CoV was less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, with evolution and emergence in the human population. the most severe infections mainly in individuals with Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes the contemporary 2019-nCoV in China seems to procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only resemble SARS-CoV. The genome of 2019-nCoV also a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred.6 appears most closely related to SARS-CoV and related Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested bat coronaviruses.2 The infection has now spread widely, evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV suggesting an initial single-locus zoonotic spillover among civet sellers, suggesting previous cross-species event in November, 2019,3 and subsequent human- transmission events without necessarily human-toto-human transmission.

The 2019-nCoV is another 2018-19 in west and central Africa. Taken together, virus in the pipeline that originated from contact with these events ring alarm bells about disease emergence animals, in this case a seafood and animal market in in the 21st century, and the importance of human Wuhan, China. diseases originating from indiscriminate contacts with Inevitably, the health sectors are primarily reactive to infected animals. these events, acting to save lives as well as undertake There is an increasing focus on the human-animal- surveillance and control.

Mortalities, disability-adjusted absorbed by ordinary people, international financial life-years, and billions of dollars of economic losses systems, and tax bases, making life go on as normal, from these infections demand action and investment but not quite. The frequency, severity, and financial in prevention to face novel challenges to human and impacts of these events are growing, and the world can animal health. Research has led to better understanding no longer aford to just wait and see, especially because of the nature and drivers of cross-species viral jumps, prevention of these threats is in theory relatively simple but the detail is still elusive.

Bats have alwayshad viral populations, and despite close associationwith humans for millennia, this has not resulted inpandemics until recent times.In conclusion, have we learned lessons? Yes and no.These events are of global public health and economicimportance and need collective societal response. Butgovernments and civil society are not heeding thesewarnings, as the 2019-nCoV attests.9 Concerns havebeen repeatedly raised and voiced since the idea of OneHealth was first expressed in around 2000. 10 What weneed to learn and communicate is that the zoonotic oragricultural bridging of novel pathogens from domesticand captive wildlife needs urgent attention, alongwith attention to the human appetite for meat. Thisapproach is easily achieved for coronavirus threats\u2014eg, by substantially reducing the trade of risky speciesof wild caught animals for food or other purposes, anda culturally sensitive ban on the sale of these animalsin wet markets. Vaccines and therapeutic alternativesmight be possible and are needed, but they are aresponse, because the emerging strain is unpredictableand a vaccine is unlikely to prevent the initial events.In some parts of Africa, prevention of Ebola virus andfuture coronavirus threats require shifts in food habits,a transition frombushmeat being a cultural normor primary source of protein, and by discouragingagricultural development that brings bats into increasedcontact with humans or livestock. In the Middle East,re-evaluating and improving infection prevention andcontrol measures for camel farms, a recent introductioncoincident with the emergence of MERS-CoV, would bea positive step forward.WBK is Executive Vice President of EcoHealth Alliance and RAK, AZ, TPV, FV, DS,LEGM, OD, and LBA are members of the Pan-African Network for RapidResearch, Response, Relief, and Preparedness for Infectious Diseases Epidemicsconsortium (PANDORA-ID-NET).
