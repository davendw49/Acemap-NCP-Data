Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19. BACKGROUND The common human coronaviruses; 1. 229E (alpha coronavirus), 2. NL63 (alpha coronavirus), 3. OC43 (beta coronavirus) and 4. HKU1 (beta coronavirus) cause the common cold. Three human coronaviruses cause more severe, acute illnesses; MERS-CoV causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, SARS-CoV causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19. There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. Person to person spread of COIVD-19 in the UK has now been confirmed. To guide treatment and prevention in women affected COVID-19 during pregnancy in the current outbreak we conducted a rapid review to guide management, of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy. Expert consensus will be required in areas where data is lacking at this early stage in the COVID-19 outbreak.", "text": "METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv, see appendix for search strategies, toidentify primary case reports, case series or randomised-controlled trial describing women of anyage affected by coronavirus in pregnancy or the postnatal period. There were no date or languagerestrictions to the search. References of relevant papers were hand searched for relevant studies.Due to time constraints one person, EM, conducted the search, reviewed full texts and extracteddata on demographics, maternal outcomes, maternal diagnostic testing, maternal imaging, fetaloutcomes, perinatal outcomes, neonatal outcomes and neonatal diagnostic testing. Subjectivecomparison of outcomes for COVID-19, SARS and MERS is presented.The initial draft of review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who alsoprovided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking. This is presented as an appendix tothis review. Registration on PROSPERO and contact with study authors was not undertaken due totime constraints. Quality of study was assessed subjectively as anecdotal, low, medium or high.RESULTS PubMed search There were 9964 search results, 68 abstracts were screened, 50 wereexcluded as not including pregnant women or humans or being in-vitro studies. Eighteen relevantstudies were identified, their full texts were reviewed and all 18 were included. It is highly likely thatthere were overlaps in cases reported to be affected by SARS. MedRxiv search 600 results, 39abstracts were screened, no relevant studies identified.There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reportsand series. All studies were case reports or series with varying levels of detail on the data andoutcomes assessed, subjectively all were of low quality. A narrative review is presented.COVID 19 So far, 19 women affected in pregnancy have been reported, delivering 20 infants (1\u20133).17 were delivered by caesarean and 2 by vaginal delivery, all within 13 days of onset of illness.Where reported maternal morbidity and mortality (n=10), 1 woman required ICU and mechanicalventilation, all women had viral changes apparent on CT chest imaging and there were no maternaldeaths (1,2).SARS Case fatality rate (CFR) was 15% for all reported cases of SARS in pregnancy (4\u20139). Acasecontrol study comparing 10 pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women affected by SARS in Hong Kongreported 60% ICU admission and 40% CFR in the pregnant group compared with 17.5% and 0% in thenon-pregnant group (7). All women affected by SARS had CT or chest X-ray evidence of pneumonia.MERS In pregnant women affected by MERS, 7/11 (63%) were admitted to ICU and CFR was 3/11(27%) (10\u201315).SARS Miscarriage affected 4/7 women with 1st trimester SARS infection (6). These 4 women all hadultrasound findings of 3-5 week pregnancies of unknown location or unknown viability in whichongoing pregnancy at 13 weeks would be expected in 38% and 50% respectively (acknowledging thecomplexity in this area (16,17)). Those with fetal heart activity recorded (n=2) did not miscarry,neither did a woman in whom the diagnosis was retrospective and did not undergo ultrasound scan.MERS a single case of a women with MERS has been reported in the first trimester. This woman wasasymptomatic and went on to have a term delivery (18).COVID-19 There have been no pregnancy losses in the cases reported to date.SARS In cases reported after the 1st trimester, Zhang et al reported a series of 5 women affect (2 in2nd trimester, 3 in 3rd trimester) the loss of one twin with the other surviving to delivery. It is notclear if this was in the 2nd or 3rd trimester, this has been nominally recorded as being in the thirdtrimester(19).1. Became ill at 19 weeks gestation and experienced vaginal bleeding resulting in a late fetal loss at20 weeks(15). It should be noted that this woman refused chest radiography and medicationsbecause of her concerns about their effect on pregnancy.3. A woman with a background history of pulmonary fibrosis, asthma and spontaneouspneumothoraces presented at 24 weeks gestation with MERS pneumonia requiring ICU andventilator support. She developed ARDS and underwent emergency caesarean section to improvematernal oxygenation, the infant weighed 240g and died four hours after birth, the woman died 4weeks after this with severe refractory hypoxia and cardiac arrest(12).COVID 19 8/19 (42%) women affected delivered pre-term. In Chen et al, n=9, all mothers wereelectively delivered by caesarean section, 2 at 36 weeks gestation. In Zhu et al, 7 delivered byCaesarean sections and 2 by vaginal delivery, 5/9 women (6/10 babies) delivered pre-term. Theindication for delivery is not reported however 6 babies were affected by fetal distress prior todelivery- it seems reasonable to assume that fetal condition contributed. Wang et al report onewoman who was delivered at 30 weeks for fetal distress(2).SARS 4/16 pregnancies not affected by miscarriage resulted in pre-term delivery, at 26, 28, 32 and33 weeks gestation(18), data on timing of delivery is not reported in the series of 5 women fromZhang et al(19).MERS 3/9 pregnancies not affected by stillbirth or intrauterine death were delivered pre-term bycaesareans section, 1 at 24 weeks and 2 at 32 weeks for maternal hypoxaemia.COVID-19 Delivery occurred in all women within 13 days of onset of illness, fetal growth is unlikelyto be affected in this time period. No placental pathology is available to date.SARS show early changes also seen in pregnancies with fetal growth restriction (fibrin deposition)when delivery \u22641 week after onset illness, birthweight was normal in these pregnancies. Whendelivery was 5-7 weeks after illness onset there was fetal growth restriction in 2/3 ongoingpregnancies and their placentas showed more severe changes (areas with loss of blood supply,avascular villi, and bleeding behind placenta, abruption).MERS 4/11 women went on to deliver healthy babies at term, although birth weights are notreported for 3/4 of these. In one, a vaginal bleeding was reported at 37 weeks, causing fetalcompromise and necessitating emergency caesarean section resulting in the delivery of a maleinfant, weighing 3140g in good condition. Abruption was apparent on placental examination (11).COVID 19 Chen et al. reports 9 women delivering by caesarean section from 36 weeks onwards, 2pre-term. In two women at term, fetal distress was reported. In 6 of these women with COVID-19who delivered by caesarean section and underwent testing after delivery by caesarean section, therewas no evidence of SARS-CoV 2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood neonatal throat swab or breastmilksamples(1). A news report of a baby with a COVID-19 infected mother testing positive at 30 hourshas not been reported in scientific journals.Zhu et al report COVID 19 in 9 women delivering 10 infants, 7 by caesarean section and 2 by vaginaldelivery, 3 of which only became symptomatic after delivery. The indication for delivery was notreported. This cohort had COVID-19 from 31 weeks onwards, 6/9 pregnancies showed fetal distressand 5/9 women (6/10 babies) were delivered prematurely (3).Wang et al reported on one woman who underwent caesarean section for fetal distress at 30 weeksgestation, the infant was born in good condition and samples of amniotic fluid, neonatal gastricsamples, placenta and infant throat swabs were negative for SARS-CoV 2 (2).No vertical transmission was reported for cases of SARS or MERS in pregnancy after caesarean orvaginal delivery.Other Coronaviruses A single case series reported 3 out of 7 neonates born to mothers positive forHCoV 229E had HCoV 229E on RT-PCR in gastric samples; seroconversion was not assessed, no signsof infant infection were seen in those with positive gastric samples (20)COVID-19 In Chen et al, n=9, all babies were delivered after 36 weeks and were well at discharge (1).Zhu et al reported a cohort born at earlier gestation (from 31 weeks gestation), 6/10 babies wereadmitted to the NNU for respiratory support, 2 developed DIC and 1 multiple organ failure (3).Neonatal morbidity was more marked in this series probably due to greater prematurity, one babydied after being born at 34 weeks. Requiring admission at 30 minutes of life with respiratorydifficulties, the baby deteriorated, developed shock, DIC and multi organ failure and dies at 8 days oflife. 9/10 infants were tested for COVID-19, all testing was negative. Wang et al reported a baby bornat 30 weeks in good condition with an uneventful neonatal course(2).SARS 4/16 pregnancies not affected by miscarriage resulted in pre-term delivery, at 26, 28, 32 and33 weeks gestation (4,6,7,19,21). The baby born at 26 weeks had respiratory distress syndrome(RDS) and a bowel perforation. The baby born at 28 weeks had RDS, necrotising enterocolitis and apatent ductus arteriosus(6,9).MERS 3/9 pregnancies not affected by stillbirth or intrauterine death were delivered pre-term bycaesareans section, 1 at 24 weeks resulted in a neonatal death (birthweight 240g), 2 babiesdelivered at 32 weeks for maternal hypoxaemia have no outcomes reported (10,18).CONCLUSIONS There are limited data on the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on womenaffected in pregnancy and their babies. Studies were all case-reports or series and of low quality.Outcomes reported varied, one series on COVID-19 did not report on maternal outcomes.From the 10/19 women where maternal outcomes were reported, severe morbidity and mortalityare not evident in mothers as they were for SARS and MERS.From the data, an increase in risk of miscarriage cannot be ruled out at this stage given the SARSdata. Data from early pregnancy units are needed on women affected by COVID-19 with matchedcontrols.In women affected by COVID-19 with ongoing pregnancy, for surveillance for fetal growth restrictionwould be reasonable, given the acute and chronic placental changes observed and 2/3 ongoingpregnancies being affected by fetal growth restriction after SARS and an abruption noted after MERS.The need for provision for fetal monitoring including serial ultrasound for women with COVID-19 willbe challenging for maternity services. Women will need to be cared for in units with appropriateneonatal intensive care facilities as COVID-19 is associated with pre-term delivery in 50% of reportedcases.In SARS and MERS-affected cases, delivery was most often indicated by maternal hypoxaemia. InCOVID-19, if maternal illness is not as severe, the considerations will be based more on obstetricindications for delivery.Information on vertical transmission for COVID-19 is limited, although testing of 15 neonates born tomothers with COVID-19 has all been negative. Guidance on mode of delivery requires expertconsensus until further information emerges.There is evidence for vertical transmission of HCoV 229E, seroconversion was not investigatedhowever and all infants remained well, but there is no evidence for vertical transmission for anyother coronavirus.Consensus guidance from China advises \u201cdelayed cord clamping is not recommended\u201d in order toreduce the risk of vertical transmission and that infants should be separated from mothers affectedby COVID 19(22). Infants may acquire COVID-19 from their mothers after delivery via normal routesof transmission.Guidance from China is that \u201cInfants should not be fed with the breast milk from mothers withconfirmed or suspected of 2019-nCoV.\u201d Guidance from the CDC is less clear but is still precautionary(23).Expert consensus is needed for breastfeeding and the use of expressed breastmilk for infant feedingfor mothers affected by COVID-19 until more informative data emerges and for deciding whetherwomen with COVID-19 who are symptomatic, suggesting high viral load, should breastfeed babieswith unknown status.If the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% attack rate for the population is realised and 4%require hospitalisation, thousands of women during pregnancy will be affected at a time when staffwill themselves be unwell. In previous coronavirus epidemics there has anecdotally been a tendencytowards admitting any symptomatic, pregnant woman with proven infection.A surge in workload will likely be seen in the NHS and across the world at a time when staffing is wellbelow optimal levels. Pragmatic choices will need to be made about achievable and acceptablelevels of care with national guidance and local adaptation. It will need to be emphasised that chestimaging should be undertaken as clinically indicated in pregnant women.Therapeutics announced as being under consideration and trial in the outbreak include Kaletra(Lopinavir and Ritonavir), Remdesivir and Chloroquine. Kaletra (24) is used in the UK duringpregnancy for treatment of HIV where the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of toxicity seenin animal studies. The use of Chloroquine outweighs the risks in the prevention and treatment ofmalaria during pregnancy (25). Remdesivir has been used for the treatment of Ebola in pregnantwomen(26), however it should be acknowledged that Ebola is a condition with a CFR of 50% forwhich there would be higher tolerance for adverse effects of a potentially beneficial treatment thanwould be the case for COVID-19 where the CFR is around 1%. It would seem reasonable not toexclude seriously ill pregnant women from trials of these therapies for COVID-19.There is a need for systematic data reporting on women affected by COVID-19 and their pregnanciesto provide an evidence base for management, treatment and prevention and to target limitedresources during the outbreak.I) RCOG and RCPCH joint advice for care of women affected by COVID 19 in pregnancy, full practiceguidance is in draft at present and as data emerges will be updated.1. Antenatal care\uf0b7 We concur that while numbers remain small, all cases of mothers known to have COVID-19be referred to and managed in specialist centres with appropriate expertise in fetal medicineand co-located neonatal intensive care. As numbers of women affected by COVID 19 inpregnancy increase, it is likely to become necessary to care for women locally with referralwhere appropriate for fetal growth restriction, pre-term delivery and women requiringtreatment on an Infectious Diseases specialist unit or HCID unit\uf0b7 In common with other maternal infections, decisions about the use of corticosteroids for fetallung maturity should be made in consultation with infectious disease, neonatal andmaternal-fetal medicine consultants2. Delivery\uf0b7 Any guidance must be made in the absence of almost any useful information. Therefore theprecautionary principle should guide us, but must balance risks to mother and baby.\uf0b7 Decision on the mode of delivery should be individualised. Caesarean section may benecessitated by maternal hypoxaemia or fetal growth restriction.\uf0b7 We note the very recent consensus guidance from China suggests that \u201cdelayed cordclamping (DCC) is not recommended\u201d in order to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. Werecommend that the baby can be cleaned of maternal blood and secretions quickly anddelayed cord clamping can be undertaken.3. Care of mother and newborn\uf0b7 Separation of infected mother and newborn is recommended by China and US-CDC advice isthat this should be considered. We do not concur that mothers and baby should be routinelyseparated. We believe that routine precautionary separation of mother and baby is not in thebest interests of either party, in the current state of knowledge. This is particularly true giventhe prolonged infectious period. We note those babies most at risk, i.e. very preterm or thosewith respiratory compromise, will be on NICU and therefore necessarily separated frommothers. We emphasise that this might need to change as knowledge grows.\uf0b7 Infants born to those with COVID-19 need to be closely monitored. The RCPCH BritishPaediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) presents opportunities for surveillance.4. Infant feeding\uf0b7 Given the lack of data on vertical transmission, guidance on breastfeeding is difficult. Wenote that guidance from China is that \u201cInfants should not be fed with the breast milk frommothers with confirmed or suspected of 2019-nCoV.\u201d Guidance from the CDC is less clear butsuggests being precautionary.\uf0b7 In the current state of knowledge, we recommend that mothers with proven infection andwho are symptomatic (suggestive of high viral load) should not breastfeed babies withunknown status currently. If these mothers wish to breastfeed in the future, they shouldexpress milk and discard it and resume breastfeeding once confirmed as non-infective.\uf0b7 In less severe cases we recommend that whether to start or continue breastfeeding should bedetermined by the mother, in coordination with her family and healthcare providers.\uf0b7 We recommend that human breast milk banks should not use human milk from mothersconfirmed to be infected with COVID-19(\"gravidity\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"gravidity\"[All Fields] OR \"pregnant\"[All Fields]) OR(\"pregnancy\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"pregnancy\"[All Fields]) OR (\"breast feeding\"[MeSH Terms] OR\"breast feeding\"[All Fields] OR \"breastfeeding\"[All Fields]) OR lactating[All Fields] OR (\"infant,newborn\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"infant\"[All Fields] AND \"newborn\"[All Fields]) OR \"newborn infant\"[AllFields] OR \"neonatal\"[All Fields]) AND SARS[All Fields] OR (\"severe acute respiratorysyndrome\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\"[All Fields]) OR (\"coronavirusinfections\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"coronavirus\"[All Fields] AND \"infections\"[All Fields]) OR \"coronavirusinfections\"[All Fields] OR \"mers\"[All Fields]) OR ((\"middle east\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"middle\"[All Fields]AND \"east\"[All Fields]) OR \"middle east\"[All Fields]) AND acute[All Fields] AND respiratory[All Fields]AND (\"syndrome\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"syndrome\"[All Fields])) OR (coronaviral[All Fields] ORcoronavirdae[All Fields] OR coronaviren[All Fields] OR coronavirida[All Fields] OR(\"coronaviridae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"coronaviridae\"[All Fields]) OR coronaviridea[All Fields] OR(\"coronaviridae\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"coronaviridae\"[All Fields] OR \"coronavirinae\"[All Fields]) ORcoronavirion[All Fields] OR coronavirions[All Fields] OR (\"coronavirus\"[MeSH Terms] OR\"coronavirus\"[All Fields]) OR coronavirus'[All Fields] OR coronavirus's[All Fields] ORcoronavirusapplikation[All Fields] OR coronaviruscpe[All Fields] OR coronaviruse[All Fields] OR(\"coronavirus\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"coronavirus\"[All Fields] OR \"coronaviruses\"[All Fields]) ORcoronaviruses'[All Fields] OR coronavirusinfektion[All Fields] OR coronavirusinfektionen[All Fields]OR coronaviruslike[All Fields] OR coronavirusreplikation[All Fields] OR coronavirussen[All Fields] ORcoronavirusurile[All Fields]) OR COVID-19[All Fields] AND \"humans\"[MeSH Terms]Search terms; Pregnancy, Pregnant, Coronavirus, SARS, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, MERSMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome, HCov-229E, HCov-NL63, HCov-OC43, HCov-HKU1Contributions EM conceived the article, conducted the literature review and wrote the first draft.RV, DE, EM and PO\u2019B wrote the first draft of the RCOG and RCPCH interim guidance.
