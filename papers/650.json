While the origin of the outbreak remains uncertain,accumulating evidence links a wet market in Wuhan for the early spread of 2019-nCoV.Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet tobe investigated.Methods: Using the daily series of 2019-nCov incidenceincluding contact history withthe market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate thereproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmissiontogether with the reporting probability and the early effects of public healthinterventions.Results: Our mean R estimates for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI:0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, and 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) forhuman-to-human transmission, respectively. Moreover we estimated that the reportingrate cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 3-31 fold higher than thatfor cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact historywith the wet market played a key role in identifying 2019-nCov cases.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportions of asymptomatic and subclinicalpatients constitute a substantial component of the epidemic\u2019s magnitude. Findingssuggest that the development of rapid diagnostic tests could help bring the epidemicmore rapidly under control.        A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spreadthroughout China, with multiple cases exported to 25 countries around the world. Thecumulative number of confirmed cases has reached 75204 including 2006 deaths as ofFebruary 19, 2020 [                Evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus likely jumped from a primary reservoir (e.g,horseshoe bats) to an intermediary reservoir, possibly generating an outbreak among wildanimals in at least one wet market in Wuhan, China [                Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan for the early spread of the novelcoronavirus (COVID-19) among humans [                In this paper we conduct quantitative modeling analyses to quantify the role of the wetmarketplace on the early transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus in China [        Epidemiological incidence cases        Daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were extracted from arecently published study [        Epidemiological modellingWe model two types of infections: a) market hazard (market-to-humantransmission, including primary infections arising from zoonotic transmission to someextent) and b) human-to-human transmission chains. A model schematic of thetransmission dynamics is provided in Figure 1. Primary infection (index case) occurs asa result of a spillover event, and primary infections may generate secondary cases. Thenumber of infected individuals stemming from the market-to-human and thehuman-to-human route are denoted by im and ih, respectively.We employed a discrete-time integral equation to capture the daily incidenceseries with contact history. Let fs denote the probability mass function of the serialinterval of length s days, which is given byss 1 ,For s >0 where F(.) represents the cumulative distribution function of the gammadistribution. The expected number of new cases with onset day t after secondaryinfections, E[ch(t)], is written as follows,        E1,where E[cm(t)] represents the expected number of new cases with onset day t infectedthrough market-to-human transmission, p is the conditional probability of extinctionwithin one generation, given by 1/(Rm+1) [                To account for the type of infection dependent probability of occurrence, \u03b8 j[        E;1EE;;,,day t, hj(t), is the product of type-dependent reporting rate, qj, and the actual number ofcases, cj(t).Further, we model the time-dependent variation in the transmissibilityassociated with implementation of public interventions in Wuhan. This time dependencewas modelled by introducing a parameter \u03b4ti, by transmission route.

The likelihood function for the time series of observed cases ofprimary infection through the market-to-human transmission and secondary infectionthrough human-to-human transmission that we employ to estimate the reproductionnumber and other relevant parameters is given by:3 4;5 5;exp 8!;9.where U indicates parameter sets that are estimated from this likelihood.The serial interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with the mean and SD at7.5 and 3.4 days, respectively, based on ref. [        For sensitivity analyses, we examined the effect of varying the mean of theserial interval on Rj by varying the mean serial interval from 5.5 to 9.5 days.We estimated model parameters and made projections using a Monte CarloMarkov Chain (MCMC) method in a Bayesian framework. Point estimates and thecorresponding 95% credibility intervals were drawn from the posterior probabilitydistributions. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.2 (R Foundationfor Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and the \u2018rstan\u2019 package(No-U-Turn-Sampler (NUTS)).The daily series of nCov incidence in China in 2019-2020 are displayed inthat are not linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market follows a rapid growthpattern, whereas those cases linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market follow anoverall stable incidence pattern until early January in 2020, likely associated with theclosing of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.daily number of nCov laboratory-confirmed cases by transmission route in China fromDecember, 2019 to January, 2020. Overall, our dynamic models are able to capture thetemporal dynamics (i.e. incidence) for both market-to-human and human-to-humantransmission routes. Importantly, our posterior estimates of the basic reproductionnumbers for China in 2019-2020 are estimated at 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) formarket-to-human, and 3.87 (95%CrI:3.18-4.78) for human-to-human, respectively.Other parameter estimates for the probability of occurrence and reporting rate areestimated at 0.93 (95% CrI: 0.74-1.00) and 0.028 (95% CrI: 0.02-0.04) formarket-to-human and 0.90 (95% CrI: 0.73-0.99) and 0.00 (95% CrI: 0.00-0.01) forhuman-to-human, respectively. A Tukey-Kramer test indicated significant differences inprobabilities of occurrence (p <0.001) and reporting probability (p <0.001) according toinfection route. Moreover, the proportionate reduction in transmissibility brought aboutthe enhanced public health interventions is estimated to be 0.07 (95% CrI: 0.00-0.28)after January 1, and to be 0.50 (95% CrI: 0.02-0.97) after January 8, 2020, which ismeasured using a time-dependent scaling factor, \u03b1.The total number of estimated laboratory-confirmed cases (i.e. cumulativeincidence) are 43.0 (95% CrI: 26.4-63.7) for cases infected though market-to-humantransmission, 174.8 (95% CrI: 134.3-216.7) for cases infected through human-to-humantransmission. For comparison, the actual numbers of reported laboratory-confirmedcases during our study period are 43 and 187, respectively.Furthermore, we inferred the total number of nCov infections by transmissionroute to quantify the nCov burden in China during our study period. Our results indicatethat the total number of unobserved cases (i.e. cumulative infections) by subgroup are1685.1 (95% CrI: 1375.3- 2009.2) for those cases infected though market-to-humantransmission, and 59986.9 (95% CrI: 19925.4-200988.9) for those cases infectedthrough human-to-human transmission.Results of sensitivity analyses on the mean serial interval ranging from 5.5 to9.5 are shown in Figures 3. We found that estimates of R from human-to-humantransmission are somewhat sensitive to changes in the mean serial interval, rangingfrom 2.63 (95% CrI: 2.31-3.01) to 5.69 (95% CrI: 4.43-7.44), while R for primaryinfections takes a relatively similar range below the epidemic threshold of 1.0.We have conducted statistical modeling analyses to elucidate the earlytransmission characteristics of the novel COVID-19 outbreak in China from Decemberin 2019 to January 2020 by stratifying cases according to transmission route. Inparticular, we report estimates of the reproduction numbers for market-to-human andhuman-to-human transmission as well as the occurrence reporting probability andestimate the early effects of public health interventions.          Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction numbers for China in 2019-2020are estimated to be 0.37 (95%CrI: 0.02-1.78) for market-to-human transmission, andestimates that account for more details of the underlying transmission dynamics shedlight on the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, our analysis suggests that thetotal number of unobserved cases (i.e. cumulative infections) are estimated to be 1685.1(95% CrI: 1375.3- 2009.2) for unobserved cases from market-to-human transmissionand 59986.9 (95% CrI: 19925.4-200988.9) for unobserved cases from human-to-humantransmission. Our R estimates accounting for the unobserved cases (infections) makesthe estimated values somewhat higher than previous estimates based solely on observedcases [          Moreover, we also identified a remarkable decrease in the reproductionnumber, and this decline is in line with the timing of the closing of the Huanan SeafoodWholesale Market (identified as the origin of the epidemic) and the officialannouncement about the epidemic by China CDC. We found that R forhuman-to-human transmission decreased from 3.87 (95%CrI: 3.18-4.78) to 3.53(95%CrI: 2.84-4.35) (Relative risk reduction (RRR): 0.07 (95%CrI: 0.00-0.28)) and to1.91 (95%CrI: 0.10-3.92) (RRR: 0.50 (95%CrI: 0.02-0.97)). However, these estimatesneed to be interpreted with epidemic context in mind. Specifically, the first interventiontargeting market-to-human transmission is unlikely to have mitigated the risk ofsecondary infections arising from the unfolding transmission chains. The latter decreaseis likely the result of enhanced public interventions. However, in the context of rapidand widespread national transmission, efforts to mitigate further spread werecomplicated by difficulties to track multiple chains of transmission involving cases ofthe disease with a wide spectrum of illness including asymptomatic and subclinicalcases.          Furthermore, reporting probabilities for cases stemming from market-to-humanand human-to-human cases were estimated to be low, but we estimated that thereporting rate for market-to-human route was 3-31 fold higher, suggesting that contacthistory with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market played a key role in identifyingcases with COVID-19. Indeed, during the initial disease stages, infected individualswith COVID-19 exhibit clinical features that are similar to those of other commonrespiratory diseases [                    Our results are not free from limitations. First, the serial interval for COVID-19assumed in our analyses was extrapolated from a previous study, and had to excluderecent data from the epidemic curve due to reporting delays. In fact, our sensitivityanalysis on the serial interval indicate some influence on our R estimates. Further ourR estimates could be further improved using additional data collected by fieldinvestigations. Second, we cannot rule out the possibility that some cases with contacthistory with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market got infected by contact withhumans. However, our low R estimate for market-to-human transmission indicates thatsuch a proportion is quite low. Third, our method is a powerful tool to estimate theunderlying cases including asymptomatic and mild symptoms, and our results suggeststhat those proportions constitute a large fraction of the epidemic\u2019s magnitude. Indeed,the result of careful screening and detailed examination of a total of 566 Japanesereturnees evacuated from Wuhan city by government-chartered planes during January29-3, 2020 revealed a ratio of 5 asymptomatic to 4 symptomatic cases [          In summary, we have provided epidemiological and transmission parameters ofCOVID-19 in China from 2019 to 2020 using an ecological model. The power of ourapproach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantifieduncertainty from limited data collected by surveillance systems.AcknowledgmentsKM acknowledges support from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)KAKENHI Grant Number 18K17368 and from the Leading Initiative for ExcellentYoung Researchers from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science &Technology of Japan.
