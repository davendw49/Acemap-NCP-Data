Todevelop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecularmechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we hereinused a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found thatSARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that ofSARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) coreof the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing thatseveral mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated withenhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirusfusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection bydivergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Wethen generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potentfusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion andpseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold morepotent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effectiveagainst membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudovirusestested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potentlyinhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protectedmice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention andtreatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emergingSARSr-CoVs.55In April of 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a prioritylist of pathogens, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acuterespiratory syndrome (SARS) and Disease X, a disease with an epidemic or pandemicpotential caused by an unknown pathogen1,2 (Fig.1a).In late December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with an unknown etiology inWuhan, China was considered as the first Disease X following the announcement bywas identified as the pathogen causing the coronavirus disease COVID-19 4,5.2019-nCoV with 79.5% and 96% sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a batcoronavirus, SL-CoV-RaTG13, respectively 6, was renamed SARS-CoV-2 by theCoronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy ofAs of 24 February 2020, a total of 79,331 confirmed cases of COVID-19,including 2,618 deaths, were reported in China and 27 other countries 11, posing aserious threat to global public health and thus calling for the prompt development ofspecific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics for treatment and preventionof COVID-19.Coronaviruses (CoVs), the largest RNA viruses identified so far, belonging to theCoronaviridae family, are divided into 4 genera, \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4- and \u03b3-coronaviruses, whilethe \u03b2-coronaviruses are further divided into A, B, C, and D lineages. The seven CoVsthat can infect humans (HCoVs) include HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in the\u03b1-coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage A,SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage B (\u03b2-B coronaviruses),and MERS-CoV in the \u03b2-coronaviruses lineage C 6. To develop specific SARS-CoV-2fusion inhibitors, it is essential to study the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 comparedto that of SARS-CoV. Particularly, the spike (S) protein S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2,4which mediates membrane fusion, has 89.8% sequence identity and 96.9% sequencesimilarity to those of SARS-CoV, and both of them utilize humanangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells 6.Most importantly, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) inS1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10- to 20-fold higher than that ofSARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. However, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2can mediate membrane fusion in a manner that exceeds the capacity of SARS-CoV.After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of S protein on the virion to the ACE2receptor on the target cell, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) domains in its S2subunit of S protein interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusioncore, bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion andinfection 13. Therefore, the 6-HB fusion core structure of SARS-CoV-2 andSARS-CoV S proteins should also be compared in order to investigate the structuralbasis for membrane fusion mediated by their S proteins and thus set the stage for therational design of coronavirus fusion inhibitors.In our previous studies, we designed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1,targeting the HR1 domains of HCoV S proteins, which proved to be effective ininhibiting infection of 5 HCoVs, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and 3SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs). By intranasal application of this peptide, eitherpre- or post-challenge with a coronavirus, the treated mice were protected fromHCoV-OC43 or MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide has prophylacticand therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection14. Indeed, our recent studieshave shown that EK1 peptide is effective against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediatedmembrane fusion and PsV infection in a dose-dependent manner 15.In this study, we have shown that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits much higher capacity ofmembrane fusion than SARS-CoV, suggesting that the fusion machinery ofSARS-CoV-2 is an important target for development of coronavirus fusion inhibitors.111112113114115116117118119120121122123124We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2's 6-HB core andidentified several mutated amino acid residues in HR1 domain responsible for itsenhanced interactions with HR2 domain. By conjugating the cholesterol molecule tothe EK1 peptide, we found that one of the lipopeptides, EK1C4, exhibited highlypotent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion and PsVinfection, about 240- and 150-fold more potent than EK1 peptide, respectively.EK1C4 is also highly effective against in vitro and in vivo infection of some liveHCoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43 and MERS-CoV, suggesting potential forfurther development as pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based therapeutics and prophylacticsfor treatment and prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2and MERS-CoV, as well as future reemerging SARS-CoV and emergingSARSr-CoVs.ResultsThe capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusionFrom the GISAID Platform (https://platform.gisaid.org), we obtained thefull-length amino-acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV 2019-2020) S protein(GenBank: QHD43416). Through alignment with SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs Sproteins, we located the functional domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, whichcontains S1 subunit and S2 subunit with the cleavage site at R685/S686 15. S1 subunitis located within the N-terminal 14\u2013685 amino acids of S protein, containingN-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD), and receptor bindingmotif (RBM). S2 subunit contains fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptadrepeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) (Fig. 1b).Recent biophysical and structural evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 S proteinbinds hACE2 with 10-fold to 20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV S protein,suggesting the higher infectivity of the new virus 12. Unlike other \u03b2-B coronaviruses,S protein of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a special S1/S2 furin-recognizable site, indicatingthat its S protein might possess some unique infectious properties. Indeed, in live6SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found a typical syncytium phenomenon naturally formedby infected cells, which is rarely reported in SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1c). Tofurther explore the special characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we cloned the Sgene into PAAV-IRES-GFP vector and established the S-mediated cell-cell fusionsystem, using 293T cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S protein and EGFP(293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP) as the effector cells, and ACE2/293T cells expressinghuman ACE2 receptor as the target cells (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1a). After effector cellsand target cells were cocultured at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h, the fused cells showed at least 2-foldlarger size than normal cells and multiple nuclei, and these cells were observed in theSARS-CoV-2 group, but not the SARS-CoV group. After coincubation for 24 h,hundreds of target cells fused together as one big syncytium, containing multiplenuclei (Fig. 1d). Another 24h later, the syncytium grew bigger and could be easilyobserved under both light and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1e). Similar results wereobserved in the fusion between 293T/SARS-CoV-2/EGFP cells and Huh-7 cells,which naturally express human ACE2 receptor on the cell surface. Their syncytiumwas obviously formed after coincubation for 48 h, similar to the syncytium formed bylive SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1c and 1f). On the contrary, SARS-CoVS protein lacked the ability to mediate the cell-cell fusion under the same conditions(Fig. 1d) based on the required presence of exogenous trypsin to complete membranefusion in our previous studies. Therefore, compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein showed much more efficiency in mediating viral surface-fusion and entry intotarget cells 14. Meanwhile, no fusion was observed for 293T/EGFP cells withoutS-expression or 293T cells without ACE2-expression (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1b),confirming that S-receptor engagement is necessary for the S-mediated viral fusionand entry.X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 6-HB fusion core formed by HR1 and HR2domains in S2 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S proteinPreviously, we identified that the 6-HB formed by HR1 and HR2 domains of the167168169170171172S2 subunit plays a very important role in the membrane fusion process mediated byHR1 and HR2 in subunit S2 of SARS-CoV-2 also interacted to form coiled-coilcomplex to support membrane fusion and viral infection15 (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2).However, the specific binding characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 6-HB remained to beexplored.To understand the structural basis of the interactions between HR1 and HR2regions of SARS-CoV-2, a fusion protein containing the major parts of HR1 (residues910 to 988) and HR2 (residues 1162 to 1206) with a flexible linker (L6, SGGRGG) inbetween was constructed for crystallographic study. The crystal structure ofHR1-L6-HR2 shows a canonical 6-HB structure with a rod-like shape 115 \u00c5 in lengthand 25 \u00c5 in diameter (Fig. 2b). The three HR1 domains form a parallel trimericcoiled-coil center, around which three HR2 domains are entwined in an antiparallelmanner. The interaction between these two domains is predominantly a hydrophobicforce. Each pair of two adjacent HR1 helices forms a deep hydrophobic groove,providing the binding site for hydrophobic residues of the HR2 domain, includingV1164, L1166, I1169, I1172, A1174, V1176, V1177, I1179, I1183, L1186, V1189,L1193, L1197 and I1198 (Fig. 2c). The hydrophobic interactions between HR1 andHR2 are mainly located in the helical fusion core region, which will be discussedlater.The overall 6-HB structure of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other HCoVswith root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.36 \u00c5 to SARS-CoV 6-HB and 0.66 \u00c5to MERS-CoV 6-HB for all the C\u03b1 atoms (Fig. 2d). This finding suggested that theoverall 6-HB conformation is an important and highly conserved component for thesedangerous coronaviruses. When comparing with the 6-HB of other commoncoronaviruses causing mild respiratory disease, such as 229E and NL63, theSARS-CoV-2 6-HB has a similar overall structure, except for the different length ofHR2 helix in the 6-HB. The HR2 domain of 229E or NL63 forms a longer and195196197bending helix to interact with trimeric HR1 core (Fig. 2e). The relationship betweenthe structural difference and the pathogenicity of these HCoVs remains to beelucidated.According to sequence alignment, the S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 andSARS-CoV are highly conserved, with 92.6% and 100% overall homology in HR1and HR2 domains, respectively. Inside the fusion core region of HR1 domain, thereare 8 different residues (Fig. 3a), which may contribute the enhanced interactionsbetween HR1 and HR2 and stabilize 6-HB conformation of SARS-CoV-2 as revealedby crystallographic analysis, compared with those of SARS-CoV. This significantdifference has not been observed in other SARS-like viruses, such as WIV1, Rs3367,and RsSHC014. As shown in Figure 3b, the K911 in SARS-CoV HR1 could bind toE1176 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.9 \u00c5 in distance. However, with the Lys-Serreplacement, S929 in SARS-CoV-2 binds to S1196 through a strong hydrogen bond2.4 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV, Q915 in the HR1 domain does not bind to the HR2domain. However, with Q-K replacement in the new virus, K933 in the HR1 domainbinds to carbonyl oxygen of N1172 in HR2 through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance(Fig. 3b). In SARS-CoV, E918 in the HR1 domain binds to R1166 in the HR2 domainthrough a weak salt bridge 3.7 \u00c5 in distance. In SARS-CoV-2, E918 is mutated toD936 and binds to R1185 in the HR2 domain through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance(Fig. 3c). In SARS-CoV, K929 in HR1 binds to E1163 in HR2 through a salt bridge3.2 \u00c5 in distance, while T925 is not involved in the interaction. However, when T925was mutated to S943, it could bind to E1182 in the HR2 domain with a hydrogenbond 2.6 \u00c5 in distance, and K947 could also bind to E1182 through a salt bridge 3.0\u00c5 in distance (Fig. 3d). These results suggested that the multiple replacements in theHR1 domain of emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus could enhance the interactions betweenHR1 and HR2 domain to further stabilize the 6-HB structure, which may lead toincreased infectivity of the virus.222223Design and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of lipopeptides withremarkably improved fusion inhibitory activityPreviously, we found that peptide EK1 could disturb viral 6-HB formation andeffectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PsV infection. However, the potent stability ofSARS-CoV-2 6-HB structure might reduce the antiviral efficacy of EK1. Recently,numerous reports have shown that the lipidation strategy can effectively improve theantiviral activity of fusion inhibitory peptides, such as the ant-HIV-1 peptide LP-19 18,and the anti-Nipah virus lipopeptides 19. In order to improve the inhibitory activity ofEK1, cholesterol (Chol) and palmitic acid (Palm) were covalently attached to theC-terminus of EK1 sequence under the help of a flexible polyethylene glycol (PEG)spacer, and the corresponding lipopeptides EK1C and EK1P were constructed,respectively (Fig. 4a). Both of them could completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mediatedcell-cell fusion at the concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM (Fig. 4b). The inhibitory activity withmean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values is 48.1 nM for EK1C and 69.2 nMfor EK1P, respectively (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, the EK1-scrambled peptide showed noinhibitory activity with the concentration up to 5 \u03bcM (Fig. 4c). These results stronglysuggest that lipidation of EK1 is a promising strategy to improve its fusion-inhibitoryactivity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially, cholesterol-modification.On the basis of the structure of EK1C, series of cholesteryl EK1 with multiplelinkers were constructed, where the glycine/serine-based linker, i.e., GSG, orPEG-based spacer was employed between EK1 and the cholesterol moiety (Fig. 4d).Compared with EK1C1, EK1C2 and EK1C showed similar inhibitory activities.Strikingly, EK1C3 peptide with both the 3-amino acid linker \u201cGSG\u201d and thePEG4-based spacer, exhibited 4-fold more potency than EK1C1. It is noteworthy thatchanging \u201cGSG\u201d in EK1C3 to a longer 5-amino acid linker \u201cGSGSG\u201d significantlyincreased the inhibitory potency of the hybrid molecule, and EK1C4 had IC50 value of1.3 nM, which was 43-fold more potent than EK1C1. These findings indicate that thelinker length has a significant effect on the overall activity of lipopeptides.250251252253254255Comparison of increasing PEG-based arm lengths in EK1C4 shows that inhibitorspotency slightly decreased in the cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 4e). The data suggest that\u201cGSGSG-PEG4\u201d linker was optimal to bridge both parts of the conjugates. Similarly,EK1C4 showed the most potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 PsVinfection, with IC50 value of 15.8 nM, providing 149-fold stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2activity than that of EK1 (IC50=2,375 nM) (Fig. 4f).The lipopeptide EK1C4 exhibits the most potent inhibitory activity againstmembrane fusion mediated by S proteins and entry of pseudotypedcoronavirusesWe have previously demonstrated that EK1 could effectively inhibit divergentHCoV infection by targeting the HR1 domains, including \u03b1-HCoV and \u03b2-HCoV. Here,we further systematically evaluated the broad-spectrum surface-fusion inhibitoryactivity of EK1C4 on cell-cell fusion mediated by S proteins of divergentcoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 andHCoV-229E. Among them, SARS-CoV has the closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2, andits S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion could be effectively inhibited by EK1C4 withIC50 of 4.3 nM, which is about 94-fold more active than that of EK1 (IC50 = 409.3 nM)(Fig. 5a). Similarly, EK1C4 showed extremely potent fusion-inhibitory activity onMERS-S- and OC43-S-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC50 of 2.5 nM and 7.7 nM,which were 95- and 101-fold more potent when compared to EK1, respectively,indicating that EK1C4 could potently and broadly inhibit S protein-mediated cell-cellfusion of various \u03b2-HCoVs (Fig. 5b-c). For \u03b1-HCoVs, EK1C4 also effectivelyblocked the fusion process mediated by the S protein of HCoV-229E andHCoV-NL63 with IC50 of 5.2 nM and 21.4 nM, respectively, while EK1 showedinhibitory activity of IC50 ranging from 207.4 to 751.0 nM (Fig. 5d-e). Moreover, withtheir potential for human infection, SL-CoVs, including WIV1, Rs3367 andRsSHC014, the fusion process of which is mediated by S protein, could also besignificantly prevented by EK1C4 with IC50 ranging from 4.3 to 8.1 nM, as well as278279280EK with IC50 ranging from 237.0 to 279.6 nM (Fig. 5f-h). As control, theEK1-scrambled peptide showed no inhibitory activity with concentration up to 5 \u03bcMin all those coronavirus cell-cell fusion assays (Fig. 5a-h).We also assessed the antiviral activity of EK1C4 on PsV infection by divergentcoronaviruses. As expected, EK1C4 showed much more potent activity than EK1(IC50 ranging from 631.8 to 3237.0 nM) against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, andHCoV-OC43 infection with IC50 of 11.7 nM, 11.1 nM and 37.7 nM, respectively (Fig.5i-k). EK1C4 also effectively blocked PsV infection of \u03b1-HCoVs, includingHCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, with IC50 of 12.4 nM and 76.6 nM, respectively,which was about 319- and 99-fold more active than EK1 (IC50 ranging from 3,963 to7,666 nM) (Fig. 5l-m). Similarly, by cholesteryl modification with \u201cGSGSG-PEG4\u201dlinker, the inhibitory activity of EK1 could be significantly increased on PsV infectionfrom SL-CoVs, including WIV1 and Rs3367, where EK1C4 showed potent inhibitoryactivity with IC50 of 30.8 nM and 66.9 nM, respectively, which is 175-fold to 89-foldmore potent than that of EK1 (Fig. 5n-o).EK1C4 possesses the most potent inhibitory activity against in vitro infection bylive coronavirusesWe further assessed the inhibitory activity of EK1C4 against live HCoVs infection,including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63.Importantly, EK1C4 effectively blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection at the cellular levelin a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 36.5 nM, being 67-fold more active than thatof EK1 (IC50=2,468 nM) (Fig. 6a), which is consistent to the results of cell-cell fusionassay and PsV infection assay mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Similarly, EK1C4also showed more potent antiviral activity than EK1 against MERS-CoV,HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 infection with IC50s of 4.2 nM, 24.8nM, 101.5 nM and 187.6 nM, respectively, which are 190-, 62-, 42- and 19-fold morepotent than those of EK1, respectively (Fig. 6b-e). We next assessed the cytotoxicityof EK1C4 on various target cells and found that the half cytotoxic concentration306307308309310311312313314315316(CC50) was beyond 5 \u03bcM, which is the highest detection concentration of EK1C4 (Fig.S3). Therefore, the selectivity index (SI=CC50/IC50) of EK1C4 is >136, suggestingthat EK1C4 is a promising SARS-CoV-2 fusion inhibitor with little, or even no, toxiceffect in vitro. Further, we explored the potent antiviral mechanism of EK1C4 andfound that the complexes of EK1C4/SARS-2HR1, EK1C4/MERS-HR1, andEK1C4/SARS-2HR1 harbor higher stability and increased Tm values than those of thecomplexes formed by EK1 and HR1s (Fig. S4). These results suggested that increasedantiviral activity of EK1C4 should be related its increased binding affinity with HR1,but their detailed interactions require further studies.Intranasally applied EK1C4 showed strong protection of mice againstHCoV-OC43 infectionRecently, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread in humans by transmitting through therespiratory tract. Here, we used an HCoV-OC43 infection mouse model to furtherinvestigate the potential prophylactic effect of EK1C4 in clinical applications via theintranasal administration route (Fig. 6f-g). In the OC43-infected mouse model, wetreated newborn mice with EK1C4 at a single dose of 0.5 mg/kg 0.5 h (Pre-0.5), 2 h(Pre-2), 4 h (Pre-4), 12 (Pre-12) and 24 h (Pre-24) before challenging withHCoV-OC43 at 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose). Starting from 4 days\u2019post-infection (dpi), the body weight of mice in the viral control group decreasedsignificantly along with 100% mortality (Fig. 6f-g). The final survival rates of mice inPre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, Pre-12 and Pre-24 groups were 100%, 100%, 100%, 83% and0%, respectively (Fig. 6f-g). In contrast, EK1 with a single dose of 20 mg/kg via nasaladministration exhibited very promising prophylactic effect in the Pre-0.5 h and Pre-1h groups, whereas all mice in the EK1-Pre-2 h group eventually died similarly to themice in the viral control group (Fig. S5). These results suggested that EK1C4 hasbetter stability, antiviral activity, and prolonged half-life in the airway environmentwhen compared with EK1.333334335336337338339340341342343344345346347348We then tested the therapeutic effect of EK1C4 0.5 h (Post-0.5 group) and 2 h(Post-2 group) after HCoV-OC43 infection (Fig. 6h-i). The Post-0.5 group and Post-2group mice showed 100% and 16.7% survival rate, respectively, suggesting thatEK1C4 harbors good therapeutic effect after a short period of HCoV-OC43 infection,possibly resulting from the establishment of HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse brainwhere EK1C4 cannot get through the blood brain barrier via nasal administration14.As shown in Fig. S6, high viral titer was detected in brains of all 5 mice in Pre-24group and 4 out of 5 mice in Post-2 group, but was not detected in brain tissues of allmice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, and Post-0.5 groups, while only moderate level of viraltiter was detected in brain tissue in one of the 5 mice in Pre-12 group (Fig. S6 a and b).Similar to those in the viral control mice, mice in Pre-24 and Post-2 groups exhibitedsimilar histopathological changes in brain tissues, including vacuolation, degeneration,and infiltration. However, the brain tissues of mice in Pre-0.5, Pre-2, Pre-4, Pre-12and Post-0.5 group as well as the normal control group showed no apparenthistopathological changes (Fig. S6 c).DiscussionOver the past 20 years, highly infectious pathogens have been emergingincreasingly, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012 20-22. In 2018,WHO proposed \u201cDisease X\u201d in the blueprint priority diseases for any new unknownpathogen that may cause an epidemic or pandemic in the future, calling for thedevelopment of effective and safe vaccines and antivirals to prevent and treat suchDisease X. Indeed, at the end of 2019, the outbreak of Wuhan pneumonia with anunknown etiological agent, the first Disease X following WHO's announcement wasreported to WHO. Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also knownas 2019-nCoV or HCoV-19), was identified to be the etiology of the Wuhanpneumonia, i.e., COVID-19 as designated by WHO.Unlike SARS-CoV, live SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were found to form typicalsyncytium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may mainly utilize the plasma membrane361362363364365366367368369370371372373374375376377378379380381382383384385386387388389fusion pathway to enter and replicate inside host cells. Consistently, in the cell-cellfusion system, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could effectively mediate the formation ofsyncytium between the effector cell and the target cell in the absence of an exogenousproteolytic enzyme, e.g., trypsin, while SARS-CoV S protein could not. Actually, theplasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosomal membranefusion pathway for most viruses because the latter is more prone to activating the hostcell antiviral immunity23,24. Generally, \u03b2-B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2furin-recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state. Forexample, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusionpathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated25.Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity ofSARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in Sprotein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored(Fig. S7). A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 forplasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute anoption for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell 27.The 6-HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVsplays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of themost important targets for drug design. In previous studies, we have found that HR1and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 could form a stable coiled-coil complex, but the detailedconformations remain unknown. According to the X-ray crystallographic analysis ofthe complex formed by HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b), it is a typical 6-HBfusion core structure similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although theamino acid sequences of HR2 domain from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are fullyidentical, multiple residue differences occur in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV-2.However, instead of weakening the interaction between HR1 and HR2, such unilateraldifference seems to form new interactions in some regions and enhance the existingones in other regions (Fig. 3). When K991 in SARS-CoV HR1 was replaced with15S929 in SARS-CoV2 HR1, a new, strong hydrogen bond was formed with a distanceof 2.4 \u00c5. K933 forms a new interaction with N1192 in SARS-CoV-2 with a distanceof 2.7 \u00c5, whereas the corresponding position in SARS-CoV has no such interaction.In the other two regions, E918 binds to R1166 and K929 binds to E1163 inSARS-CoV, both of which were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest thatthis new HCoV has evolved with improved binding affinity between HR1 and HR2domains, which may accelerate the viral membrane fusion process and enhance viralinfectivity or transmissibility. A recent study also found that the binding affinitybetween ACE2 receptor on the host cell and RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 ismore than 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may also be associated withthe increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-212.The conjugation of cholesterol to viral entry inhibitor has been proved to be aneffective strategy to enhance the antiviral activity, such as C34 peptide for HIV-1 28.However, the mechanism of this enhancement, especially the role of cholesterol groupin the C-terminal tail of entry inhibitor, is still unclear. There is a possibility that thecholesterol group could anchor to the target membrane to facilitate the binding ofinhibitor to the HR1 targets. However, we noticed that binding affinity betweenEK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2-HR1P is significantly enhanced than EK1 peptide alone,which suggested that cholesterol group may be involved in binding to HR1P directly(Fig. S4). Therefore, using structural simulation and docking method, we predicted apossible model of EK1C4 in binding with SARS-CoV-2 HR1P (Fig. S8). In thismodel, the EK1C4 peptide anchors to one of the three hydrophobic grooves of HR1trimer via its EK1 moiety, and also anchors to another adjacent hydrophobic groove ofHR1 trimer via its cholesterol moiety. The cholesterol group of EK1C4 may bind toHR1P through hydrophobic interactions, while several hydrogen bonds may formbetween HR1 and helical region of EK1C4. The intermediated GSGSG-PEG4 linkerof EK1C4 peptide is just enough to connect these two moieties on the two bindingtargets. Admittedly, the exact mechanism and structure of EK1C4 need more studiesin the future.419420421422423424425426427428429430431432433434435436437438439440441442443444445446447In the past few decades, the viral HR1 domain has been proved to be an importanttarget for the development of viral fusion and entry inhibitors. In the early outbreak ofMERS, we quickly solved the 6-HB fusion core structure formed by MERS-CoV Sprotein HR1 and HR2 domains and designed the fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2which proved to be highly effective in blocking its spike protein-mediated membranefusion and inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection16. The results from animalexperiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectivelyprotect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lungmore than 1000-fold29. However, the MERS-CoV HR2P-M2 peptide could not inhibitSARS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide lacks cross-inhibitory activityagainst other \u03b2-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs. To be well preparedfor combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, wedesigned and synthesized the first pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and foundthat EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested,including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs. As expected, werecently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel\u03b2-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 15. We then optimized EK1 peptide in hopes of improving itsfusion inhibitory activity. Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides,EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Sprotein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1. EK1C4also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV,MERS-CoV and other HCoVs. EK1C4 showed prolonged and significantprophylactic effect against HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse model, suggesting thatEK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.Consistent with other studies 35, HCoV-OC43 was showed as a typical neurotropicvirus in the mouse model, and quickly entered and established infection in mousebrain tissue, leading to the relatively weak therapeutic effect of EK1C4 via intranasaladministration. However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected and caused severepathological changes in human lung tissue 4. Therefore, EK1C4 administered448449intranasally is expected to have good therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2infection.Currently, no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used inclinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A number ofnonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV proteaseinhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have beenused in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection 30. Their in vivo efficacies stillrequire further confirmation. Their potential use for treatment of infection by othercoronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Compared withthese clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages fortreatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the sequence of its target,the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved. Therefore, EK1C4possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drug-resistantmutations. Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to preventcoronavirus infection. The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who willhave close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations. Third, EK1C4 canbe used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads intheir lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection andreducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons. Theinhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense ofstaying in hospitals. Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it willbe used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemicaldrugs. Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can beused for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but alsoother HCoVs. Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified 31, butwe found that both the HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show100% identity (Fig. S9), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target. In themeantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain,making it more resistant to the viral mutations. Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional18promise to be developed as the first pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based antiviraltherapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of infection by the currentlycirculating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and the future reemerging SARS-CoV andemerging SARSr-CoVs.MethodsCell Lines, viruses and PeptidesThe human primary embryonic kidney cell line (293T) (CRL-3216\u2122), Calu-3(HTB-55\u2122), A549 (CCL-185), Vero E6 (CRL-1586\u2122), RD (CCL-136\u2122), andLLC-MK2 Original (CCL-7\u2122) cells were obtained from the American Type CultureCollection (ATCC). Human hepatoma Huh-7 cells were from the Cell Bank of theChinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China), and 293T cells stably expressinghuman ACE2 (293T/ACE2) cells were kindly provided by Dr. Lanying Du. All ofthese cell lines were maintained and grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium(DMEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/mlstreptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Gibco).Patient-derived COVID-19 (BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) was isolated by theChuan Qin (Beijing Key Laboratory for Animal Models of Emerging andRe-emerging Infectious Diseases). ATCC strain of Human coronavirus 229E(HCoV-OC43, VR-740), as well as Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-229E, VR-1558)and HCoV-NL63 (Amsterdam strain) strains were amplified in Huh-7, HCT-8 andLLC-MK2 cells, respectively.Peptides were synthesized by Chao Wang (Beijing Institute of Pharmacology andToxicology). The sequences of EK1(SLDQINVTFLDLEYEMKKLEEAIKKLEESYIDLKEL) and EK1-scrambled(LKVLLYEEFKLLESLIMEILEYQKDSDIKENAEDTK) have been reported in ourprevious study 14PlasmidsThe envelope-expressing plasmids of SARS-2-S (pcDNA3.1-SARS-2-S), SARS-S(pcDNA3.1-SARS-S), MERS-S (pcDNA3.1-MERS-S), OC43-S(pcDNA3.1-OC43-S), NL63-S (pcDNA3.1-NL63-S), 229E-S (pcDNA3.1-229E-S),and bat SARS-like CoV-S (pcDNA3.1-WIV1-S, pcDNA3.1-Rs3367-S andpcDNA3.1-SHC014-S), and the plasmids pAAV-IRES-EGFP that encode EGFP aswell as the luciferase reporter vector (pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-) were maintained in ourlaboratory.Cell\u2013cell fusion assayThe establishment and detection of several cell\u2013cell fusion assays are as previouslydescribed 14,16. In brief, Huh-7 cells (for testing all coronaviruses) or 293T/ACE2 cells(for testing SARS-CoV-2) were used as target cells. For preparing effector cellsexpressing S protein a coronavirus, 293T cells were transfected with one of the Sprotein expression vectors, including 293T/SARS-CoV-2/GFP,293T/MERS-CoV/GFP, 293T/HCoV-229E/GFP, 293T/SARS-CoV/GFP, or293T/SL-CoV/GFP, 293T/HCoV-OC43/GFP, 293T/HCoV-NL63/GFP or emptyplasmid pAAV-IRES-EGFP. For SARS-CoV S-, SL-CoV S-, OC43 S- or NL63S-mediated cell-cell fusion assays, effector cells and target cells were cocultured inDMEM containing trypsin (80 ng/mL) for 4 h, while for SARS-CoV-2 andMERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion assays, effector cells and target cells werecocultured in DMEM without trypsin but 10% FBS for 2 h. After incubation, fivefields were randomly selected in each well to count the number of fused and unfusedcells under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S).Inhibition of HCoV S-mediated cell-cell fusionThe inhibitory activity of a peptide on a HCoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion wasassessed as previously described14,16. Briefly, a total of 2\u00d7104 cells/well target cells531532533534535536(Huh-7) were incubated for 5 h. Afterwards, 104 cells/well effector cells (293T/S/GFP)were added in the presence or absence of a peptide at the indicated concentrations at37 \u00b0C for 2 h. 293T/EGFP cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were used as anegative control. The fusion rate was calculated by observing the fused and unfusedcells using fluorescence microscopy.Inhibition of pseudotyped HCoV infection293T cells were cotransfected with pNL4-3.luc.RE (the luciferase reporter-expressingHIV-1 backbone) and pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2-S (encoding for CoVs S protein)using VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China) 16,32,33. Pseudotypedparticles were efficiently released in the supernatant. The supernatant was harvested at72 h post-transfection, centrifuged at 3000\u00d7 g for 10 min, and frozen to \u221280 \u00b0C. Todetect the inhibitory activity of a peptide on infection of coronavirus PsV, target cells(293T/ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs; RD cells for HCoV-OC43;one day prior to infection 14. PsV was mixed with an equal volume of a peptide whichwas series diluted with PBS at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The mixture was transferred to theHuh-7 cells. Medium was changed after 12 h and incubation continued for 48 h.Luciferase activity was analyzed by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison,WI, USA).Inhibition of live HCoV replicationThe inhibition assay for live SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was performed in abiosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility at the Wuhan Research Institute and Beijing KeyLaboratory for Animal Models of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases,respectively6. Inhibition activity of peptides on SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV wasdetermined by plaque reduction assay. Peptides with different dilution concentrationswere mixed with SARS-CoV-2 (100 TCID50) for 30 minutes and then added tomonolayer VERO-E6 cells. After adsorption at 37 \u00b0C, the supernatant was removed,and 0.9 % methyl cellulose was overlaid on the cells. After 72 h, the plates were fixed21and stained. Plaques were counted by fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde and stainingwith 0.1% crystal violet. To test the effect of peptide on HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229Eand HCoV-NL63 replication, 50 \u03bcL of 100 TCID50 virus were mixed with an equalvolume of peptide and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 1 hour. Afterwards, the mixture wasadded to RD, Huh-7 and LLC-MK2 cells, respectively. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8,Dojindo, Kumamoto, Kyushu, Japan) assay was applied to determine cytopathiceffect.Circular dichroism spectroscopyThe peptides or peptide mixtures were dissolved in PBS to prepare a solution with afinal concentration of 10 \u03bcM at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min and then measured on aJasco-815circular dichroism spectrometer 34. The scanning wavelength range was 198-260 nm.Thermal denaturation detection starts at 222 nm with a 5 \u00b0C/min thermal gradientdetection.Mouse infection studiesNewborn mice were bred from pregnant mice purchased from the Animal Center ofFudan University, and all the related experiments were carried out in strict accordancewith institutional regulations (approval number 20190221-070, approval date 21February 2019). Each group had 12 3-day-old mice. To test the protective effect ofpeptides on HCoV-infected mice, EK1C4 (0.5 mg/kg), EK1 (20 mg/kg) in 2 \u00b5l 28%Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-Cyclodextrin (HBC), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution,were administered intranasally 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 12, and 24 h before challenge, or 0.5 and 2h after challenge . Then mice were challenged intranasally with HCoV at a dose of102 TCID50. For the viral control group, the same volume of 28% HBC or PBS wasadministered intranasally. In each group, six mice were randomly selected foreuthanasia on day 5 after infection, then five mice for collecting and assessing theviral titer in mouse brain, one mouse for brain histological examination. Body weightand survival of the remaining six mice in each group were monitored for 14 days 35586587588589590591592593594595596597598599600601602603604605606607608609610611612Cytotoxicity assayCytotoxicity of the peptides to the cells (Vero-E6, Huh-7, LLC-MK2 and RD cells)was tested by using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Briefly, each cell type wasseeded into the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (10,000 per well) and incubated at37 \u00b0C for 12-15 h, replacing medium with DMED containing EK1C4 at gradedconcentrations to culture at 37 \u00b0C for 2 days; CCK-8 solution (10 \u03bcL per well) wasadded, followed by an additional incubation for 4 h. The absorbance was measured at450 nm.Expression and purification of fusion protein HR1-L6-HR2 of SARS-CoV-2The coding sequences of HR1 (residues 910 to 988) and HR2 (residues 1162 to 1206)domains of SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunits were tandem linked though a 6-residue linker(L6: SGGRGG). The resulting sequences encoding the fused HR1-L6-HR2 proteinwere then cloned into a modified pET-28a vector containing a His6-SUMO tagupstream of the multiple cloning site. The recombinant construct was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) mediasupplemented with 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin at 37 \u00b0C and were induced with 1 mM IPTGfor 12 h at 16 \u00b0C overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 g for 10min at 4 \u00b0C and were lysed by high-pressure homogenizer twice after resuspension inbuffer containing 25 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 mM NaCl. The fusion proteinswere isolated by Ni-affinity chromatography, and the SUMO tag was removed byUlp1 enzyme (1:100 w/w) cleavage. HR1-L6-HR2 protein was concentrated andgel-filtered on a 10/300 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) column. Peak fractionscontaining HR1-L6-HR2 trimer were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml throughcentrifugation (EMD Millipore).Crystallization and structure determinationCrystals were obtained at 16 \u00b0C for 7 days using the hanging drop vapor diffusionmethod by mixing equal volume of protein solution (HR1-L6-HR2, 10 mg/mL) and613614615616617618619620621622623624625626627628629630631632633634635636637638reservoir solution (10% PEG8000, 200 mM zinc acetate, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0). Thencrystals were flash-frozen and transferred to liquid nitrogen for data collection. On thein-house (Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) X-ray source(MicroMax 007 generator (Rigaku, Japan)) combined with Varimax HR optics(Rigaku, Japan), HR1-L6-HR2 crystals at 100 K were diffracted to 2.9-\u00c5 resolution ata wavelength of 1.5418 \u00c5. A native set of X-ray diffraction data was collected withthe R-AXIS IV ++ detector (Rigaku, Japan) with an exposure time of 3 min per imageand was indexed and processed using iMosflm 36. The space group of the collecteddataset is P21. Molecular replacement was performed with PHENIX.phaser 37 to solvethe phasing problem, using the SARS-CoV S protein core structure (PDB code1WYY) as a search model. The final model was manually adjusted in COOT andrefined with Refmac 38. Data collection statistics and refinement statistics are given inTable 1. Coordinates were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB code:6LXT). The interaction model of EK1C4 peptide and HR1 domains of SARS-nCoV-2was predicted by SWISS-MODEL sever 39 using 6XLT as reference for EK1 moiety,and by Autodock 4 software 40 for cholesterol moiety (Fig. S8).Statistical analysisThe survival rates of mice were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.

To\ndevelop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular\nmechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein\nused a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that\nSARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of\nSARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core\nof the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that\nseveral mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with\nenhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus\nfusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by\ndivergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We\nthen generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent\nfusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and\npseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more\npotent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective\nagainst membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses\ntested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently\ninhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.\nIntranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected\nmice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and\ntreatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging\nSARSr-CoVs.\n55", "one_words_summarize": "Contributed equally#USA;2830The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. Meanwhile, no fusion was observed for 293T/EGFP cells withoutS-expression or 293T cells without ACE2-expression (Fig. The interaction between these two domains is predominantly a hydrophobicforce. When comparing with the 6-HB of other commoncoronaviruses causing mild respiratory disease, such as 229E and NL63, theSARS-CoV-2 6-HB has a similar overall structure, except for the different length ofHR2 helix in the 6-HB. In SARS-CoV-2, E918 is mutated toD936 and binds to R1185 in the HR2 domain through a salt bridge 2.7 \u00c5 in distance(Fig. These results stronglysuggest that lipidation of EK1 is a promising strategy to improve its fusion-inhibitoryactivity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially, cholesterol-modification. Strikingly, EK1C3 peptide with both the 3-amino acid linker \u201cGSG\u201d and thePEG4-based spacer, exhibited 4-fold more potency than EK1C1. Similarly, EK1C4also showed more potent antiviral activity than EK1 against MERS-CoV,HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 infection with IC50s of 4.2 nM, 24.8nM, 101.5 nM and 187.6 nM, respectively, which are 190-, 62-, 42- and 19-fold morepotent than those of EK1, respectively (Fig. Starting from 4 days\u2019post-infection (dpi), the body weight of mice in the viral control group decreasedsignificantly along with 100% mortality (Fig. These results suggested that EK1C4 hasbetter stability, antiviral activity, and prolonged half-life in the airway environmentwhen compared with EK1.333334335336337338339340341342343344345346347348We then tested the therapeutic effect of EK1C4 0.5 h (Post-0.5 group) and 2 h(Post-2 group) after HCoV-OC43 infection (Fig. Forexample, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusionpathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated25.Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity ofSARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in Sprotein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored(Fig. A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 forplasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute anoption for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell 27.The 6-HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVsplays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of themost important targets for drug design. The results from animalexperiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectivelyprotect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lungmore than 1000-fold29. We then optimized EK1 peptide in hopes of improving itsfusion inhibitory activity. EK1C4 showed prolonged and significantprophylactic effect against HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse model, suggesting thatEK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Their potential use for treatment of infection by othercoronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear. Theinhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense ofstaying in hospitals. ATCC strain of Human coronavirus 229E(HCoV-OC43, VR-740), as well as Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-229E, VR-1558)and HCoV-NL63 (Amsterdam strain) strains were amplified in Huh-7, HCT-8 andLLC-MK2 cells, respectively.
