Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15-6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71-5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as", "text": "323334possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID-19 cases. The most effectivestrategy needs to be confirmed in further studies.1        The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China in December and quicklyspread to China and many countries and regions in the world(                Global public health measures are required to cope with the rapid spread of the epidemic. China hastaken precise and differentiated strategies, including self-quarantine of residents in Wuhan and otherareas, community-based prevention and control. These measures have played an important role inpreventing and controlling the epidemic. Previous studies have shown that due to the isolation ofWuhan, the overall epidemiological progress in mainland China has been delayed by three to fivedays and the number of internationally transmitted cases has been reduced by nearly 80%(                Mathematical modeling is helpful to predict the possibility and severity of disease outbreak andprovide key information for determining the type and intensity of disease intervention. The SIRmodel and its modifications such as SEIR model have been widely applied to the current outbreak ofCOVID-19. Tang et al. estimated the infectivity of COVID-19 based on a classicalsusceptibleexposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemiological model(        AIM 2: Predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Italy via a modified and calibrated model.AIM 3: Assess the effectiveness of Italian existing and assumed precautionary quarantine measures.2Methodsauthor/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.All rights reserved.

We also assumed that the Italy government tookcountry blockade and intensified quarantine on Mar 05 or Mar 15.We did prediction with an R software package\u2014eSIR which can output the Markov Chain MonteCarlo (MCMC) estimation, inference, and prediction under the extended SIR models withtimevarying transmission modifier \u03c0(t). The model can also yield the turning points of theepidemiological trend of COVID-19. The first turning point was defined as the mean predicted timewhen the daily proportion of infected cases becomes smaller than the previous ones. The secondturning point was defined as the mean the predicted time when the daily proportion of removed cases(i.e. both recovered and dead) becomes larger than that of infected cases. Besides, an end point wasdefined as the time when the median proportion of current infected cases turn to zero.We did all analyses in R (version 3.6.2).33.1Table 1 summarizes the posterior mean and credible intervals of R0, incidence, and endpoint inHunan and Italy according to the eSIR model. R0 for COVID-19 was respectively 3.15(95% CI:1.71\u20135.21) in Hunan and 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15\u20136.77) in Italy. There would be totally 3 988 infectedcases (95%CI:786-9 065) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7 920-81869) under the current country blockade in Italy. Figure 2 indicates an epidemiological trend ofCOVID-19 under existing preventions in Hunan, China and Italy. The first and second turning pointin Hunan appeared on Feb 04 and Feb 09. The first and second turning point in Italy is Mar 10 andMar 11. The predictions suggest that the endpoints of the COVID-19 epidemics in Hunan and Italywill come on Feb 23 (95%CI: Feb 19 to Mar 23) and Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07), separately.3.3        Discussion144145146147148149150This impact of the COVID-19 response ( overall quarantine regulations , social distancing, andisolation of infections) in China is encouraging for the many other countries(                In our study, the eSIR model with R software package was used to evaluate the impact of interventionmeasures on Italian COVID-19 epidemic. In previous studies, estimation of the epidemic of aninfectious disease is often performed using constant parameter(                Our results showed that R0 was estimated to be respectively 3.12 (95% CI, 1.83-3.01) and 3.74 (95%CI, 2.09-6.02) in SIR model and eSIR model in Italy; 2.97 (95% CI, 1.80-5.01) and 3.15 (95% CI,1.715.21) in SIR model and eSIR model in Hunan. Li Qun et al estimated R0 to be 2.2 (95% CI, 2.09-6.02)among the first 425 patients in Wuhan, China(                This study showed that COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout Italy after Feb 21. Possible reasons forsuch rapid growth of infections include:(                Previous studies have shown that more rigorous government control policies were associated with aslower increase in the infected population(                tracking, and entry or exit screening, can well prevent the further spread of COVID-19. Thesemeasures are in line with the latest recommendations by the World Health Organization and aprevious study in Spain(        Our study has some limitations. Firstly, it is based on the assumption that rigorous measures likeChina have been taken in Italy, although this study uses the new model to obtain dynamic results,which is instructive for the prevention and control of the epidemic in Italy. Secondly, the suspectedcases and the daily number of hospitalized cases are not available, so they are not considered in theeSIR model. Thirdly, some unforeseeable factors may affect these estimated data in our study such assuper-spreaders exist.In conclusion, the current study is the first to provide a prediction for epidemic trend after strictprevention and control measures were implemented in Italy. Our study suggests that rigorousmeasures like China should still be maintained in Italy by Apr 25(Mar 30-Aug 07) to prevent furtherspread of COVID-19.JW, HK, LM and HY contributed to the study design.
