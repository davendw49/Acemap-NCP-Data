CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copysensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR.CRISPR-nCoV presents as a promising diagnostic option for the emerging pathogen.2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, CRISPR, metagenomic next-generation sequencing, diagnosis5556575859606162636465666768697071727374Since the beginning of 2020, a surging number of pneumonia caused by infections of a novelcoronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been identified in China, especially Wuhan, a metropolitancity with a population of over 10 million.[1, 2] In recent days, the outbreak has affectedmultiple countries and caused worldwide impact.[3-6] Currently, nucleic-acid based testshave been widely used as the reference method for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV.[7] As ofnow, more than 30,000 individuals have been identified with 2019-nCoV infection. As theepidemic develops, there are increasing demands for rapid and sensitive diagnostics for thenovel pathogen.            Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense, single-strand RNA viruses, with four majorstructural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelop (E) and nucleoprotein (N).[8,            was first discovered by metagenomic next-generationsequencing (mNGS) in which the novel virus was found to be a new pathogenic member ofthe betacoronavirus genus but shared only about 79% in genetic similarity with SARS.[8, 9]Currently, metagenomics and RT-PCR are two molecular approaches most commonly useddiagnostics for this novel virus. [13,14] However, the diagnostic performance of differentmolecular methods have not been investigated.757677787980818283848586878889909192939495Although CRISPR/Cas has been widely used as a programmable tool for gene editing since2013, the collateral, promiscuous cleavage activities of a unique group of Cas nucleases onlydiscovered recently and harnessed for in vitro nucleic acid detection.[15-19]Here, to address this question and the expanding clinical needs, we developed CRISPR-nCoV,a rapid assay for 2019-nCoV detection, and compared the diagnostic performance amongthree different technological platforms: metagenomic sequencing, RT-PCR and CRISPR. Toour knowledge, this is the first report on cross-platform comparison and the evaluation of anisothermal, CRISPR-based assay for 2019-nCoV that's rapid, sensitive and with lowinstrument requirement.Study participants and sample collectionThis study used excess RNA samples from patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infectionbased on clinical, chest imaging and epidemiological evidence. No patient identifiableinformation was collected. The only data collected from the samples were types of specimens(nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid), the concentrations and volumes ofthe purified total RNA. A total of sixty-one 2019-nCoV-suspected samples were included inthis study. Among which, 52 was confirmed positive by mNGS. This study was approved bythe ethical review committee of Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of MedicalSciences & Peking Union Medical College. Written informed consent was waived given thecontext of emerging infectious diseases.mNGS Assay for 2019-nCoVThe RNA concentrations were measured by a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were constructed by a transposase-basedmethodology with ribosomal RNA depletion (Vision Medicals, China). Sequencing wasperformed on a Nextseq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA). At least 10 million single-end75bp reads were generated for each sample. Quality control processes included removal oflow-complexity reads, low-quality reads and short reads, as well as adapter trimming. Readsderived from host genome were then removed. Taxonomic assignment of the clean reads wasperformed by aligning against the reference databases, including archaea, bacteria, fungi,human, plasmid, protozoa, univec, and virus sequences. A negative control sample wasprocessed and sequenced in parallel for each sequencing run for contamination control.Phylogenetic analysisPhylogenetic trees were constructed based on the genome sequences by means of themaximum-likelihood method. Alignment of multiple sequences was performed with theClustalW program (MEGA software, version 7.0.14).Cas13a protein and other reagents115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134The open reading frame (ORF) of Cas13a was synthesized after codon optimization. TheCas13a ORF was then cloned into expression vector Pc013 and transfected into E.coli BL21, which were first grown at 37\u00b0C and incubated with IPTG at 16\u00b0C. Proteins werepurified from lysed bacteria using the Ni-NTA protocol. Aliquots of purified protein werestored at \u221280\u00b0C. Other reagents were purchased from Sangon Co., Ltd.

Briefly,reactions containing 2.5\u00b5l of sample, 0.4 \u00b5M of each primer, 1\u00d7 reaction buffer, 14 mM ofmagnesium acetate and the RT-RPA enzyme mix were incubated at 42\u00b0C for 30 min. Afterthat, the CRISPR reaction mix consisting of the amplification product, 33.3 nM of gRNA,66.7nM of Cas13, 5mM of each NTP, 1\u03bcl T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and166 nM of ssRNA reporter was incubated at 42\u00b0C and monitored for fluorescence signal.Fluorescent signals were collected for the duration of 10 min.Plasmid constructionA 420bp genomic fragment of Orf1ab encompassing 310bp upstream and 82bp downstreamof the gRNA target site was synthesized and inserted into pUC57. These sequencesrepresented 11788-12207bp in the 2019-nCoV genome. This Orf1ab plasmid was purfied andused as positive control.Evaluation of limit of detection (LoD)155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174For the evaluation of LoD by the number of DNA copies, DNA of the 2019-nCoV plasmidwas purified and the concentrationwas determined by a Qubit (Thermo Fisher,Massachusetts). The copy number concentration was then calculated based the weight and thelength of fragment. Serial dilution with nuclease-free water was done to achieve desiredconcentrations. 2.5\u03bcl of extracted DNA at each titer was used as templates. Ten replicateswere performed at each data point near detection limit.Statistical analysisComparative analysis was conducted by Pearson \u03c72 test, Fisher exact test, the Student\u2019s t-testor log-rank test where appropriate. Data analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0software. P values <0.05 were considered significant, and all tests were 2-tailed unlessindicated otherwise.Identification of 2019-nCoV by mNGSIn order to develop a targeted assay for the novel virus, we obtained total RNA samplesfrom 61 cases suspected for 2019-nCoV infection and subjected them to metagenomicnext-generation sequencing (mNGS), the method by which this novel virus was initiallyidentified. Briefly, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA to prepare for the sequencinglibrary. Each library was subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Sequenced reads were175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194aligned to a curated database for taxonomic classification and identification of 2019-nCoVgenomic sequences.Among the 61 suspected nCoV specimens, we were able to confirm 52 cases with readnumbers mapping to the novel virus across 6 orders of magnitudes (median read of 1,484,from 2 to 19,016,501). The median genome coverage and sequencing depth was 46.8%(2.8%-100%) and 12.0\u00d7 (1.0\u00d7-7870.1\u00d7), respectively (Figure 1A). These findings indicate ahigh degree of variation in viral loads of nCoV infections. As shown in the phylogenetic trees,2019-nCoV genome identified in our specimens were highly conserved with the Wuhanstrain and closest to SARS-CoV (Figure 1B).With these genomic information, we aimed to identify target regions of 2019-nCoV bysearching for sequences that were i) within the Orf1ab, N or E genes of the viral genome; ii)conserved among strains of the novel virus; iii) differentiable from other pathogeniccoronaviruses. By analyzing the genetic similarity among the 52 cases 2019-nCoV and otherpathogenic CoVs (Figure 1C), we identified two potential target sequences in Orf1ab and onein the N gene (data not shown).Development of CRISPR-nCoVWe seek to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and simple-to-use assay by taking advantageof both the polymerase-mediated DNA amplification by RPA and the CRISPR/Cas-mediatedenzymatic signal amplification for improved sensitivity (Figure 2A). Moreover, the195196197198199200201202203204205206207208209210211212213214215isothermal nature of such an assay abolished the demand for sophiscated instruments such asthermal cyclers as for PCR-based assays.Based on the three potential target sequences we identified, multiple sets of RPA primersand CRISPR gRNAs were designed and screened. Among these, the set that targeted Orf1abshowed the best overall performance of sensitivity and specificity, and therefore, was used todevelop CRISPR-nCoV in this study for further evaluation (data not shown).We then sought to determine its analytical sensitivity by serial dilution at variousconcentrations. As shown in Figure 2B, CRISPR-nCoV consistently detected 7.5 copies of2019-nCoV in all 10 replicates, 2.5 copies in 6 out of 10 , and 1.25 copies in 2 out of 10 runs.These data indicate that CRISPR-nCoV had a near single-copy sensitivity. To confirm itsspecificity, we tested CRISPR-nCoV with DNA from human cells as well as a panel ofmicrobes including i) bacteria commonly found in respiratory infections: S. pneumonia, H.influenza, M. pneumonia, C. pneumonia, B. pertusiss; ii) human Coronaviruses: HCoV-OC43,HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E; iii) other viruses commonly found in respiratoryinfections: Adenovirus Type-3, H. Influenza B (Victoria), H influenza A (H3N2), HPIV-1,RSV-A; and iii) other bacteria: S. mitis, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. coli, E. facecaiis. None ofthe above interference samples triggered a false positive reaction (Figure 2C). Altogether,these analytical assessments suggest CRISPR-nCoV as a promising molecular assay for2019-nCoV detection with great sensitivity and specificity.Evaluation of CRISPR-nCoV in Clinical Specimens216217218219220221222223224225226227228229230231232233234235236Upon completion of the analytical assessment, we further evaluated the diagnosticpotential of CRIPSR-nCoV in clinical specimens. A total of 114 RNA samples from clinicalrespiratory samples were included in the evaluation, which consisted of 61 suspected nCoVcases (among which 52 confirmed and 9 ruled-out by mNGS), 17 nCoV-/hCoV+ cases and36 samples from healthy subjects (Figure 3A).When conducting the CRISPR-nCoV assay, a positive control (PC) DNA and ano-template control (NC) were included in parallel for each run. Florescent signal from NCwas used to normalize the signal and generate corresponding fold-change values (FC). Wenoticed that there were clear distinction in signal patterns of the reactions. Specifically, thefluorescent signal curve either remained flat as a negative curve (e.g. the NC runs) or had adistinguishable positive signal curve (e.g. the PC runs). The negative curves yielded amaximal FC value of 1.4, whereas the positive ones had a minimal FC value of 5.0. A cut-offwas set 3.0 which was set for a complete separation (Figure S1). Consistently, this cut-offoffered the optimal sensitivity and specificity as confirmed by an ROC analysis (data notshown).CRISPR-nCoVdemonstratedasensitivityof100%bydetectingall522019-nCoV-positive cases. No false positives were found in all 62 negative cases, includingall the hCoV-infected ones (Figure 3B), suggesting promising clinical sensitivity andspecificity of CRISPR-nCoV.Diagnostic Performances Among Technological Platforms237238239240241242243244245246247248249250251252253254255256257We further set out to compare the diagnostic performances among mNGS, RT-PCR andCRISPR. Using mNGS as the reference, PCR- and CRISPR-nCoV both had a specificity of100% in our study. PCR-nCoV was able to detect the virus in 90.4% (47/52) of the positivecases, with Ct\u2019s ranging from 28.8 to 40.4 and a median Ct of 35.8. It worth noting that the 5false negative samples by PCR-nCoV had a median mNGS read number of 550, which ismuch lower than that of the other positive samples at 2,381 reads, suggesting a lower titer ofthe virus in these samples. CRISPR showed a greater sensitivity by detecting all 52nCoV-confirmed cases (100%), with FC values ranging from 5.0 to 66.3 and a median FC of22.8 (Figure 4A).When the reaction turn-around time (TAT) is compared, the CRISPR-nCoV reactionrequires only 40 minutes, which is the least among the three and includes 30 minutes of DNAamplification and 10 minutes of Cas reaction. PCR-nCoV requires about 1.5 hours for acompletion run of the PCR program. mNGS takes approximately 20 hours, which includes 8hours of library preparation, 10 hours of sequencing and 2 hours of bioinformatic analysis.Because a positive result may be determined before completing the PCR program, wecalculated the effective TAT as the time when the florescent signal reached the threshold. Asshowed in Figure 4B, CRISPR-nCoV presented a significant advantage in effective TAT overPCR and mNGS.Altogether, we demonstrated a CRISPR-based assay for 2019-nCoV that offered shorterturn-around time and great diagnostic value, even in under-resourced settings without theneed of thermal cyclers. Our study also emphasized strength and weakness of different258259methodologies which should be fully considered when applied in different diagnosticsettings.Recent progresses in molecular diagnostic technologies, especially mNGS, allowed rapid,initial identification of this novel pathogenic agent at the beginning of the current 2019-nCoVepidemic.[8] Through acquiring the genome sequences of the novel virus, RT-PCR assayswere quickly developed for targeted 2019-nCoV detection.[14] However, the suddenoutbreak of 2019-nCoV created a dramatic burden not only on the society, but also on publichealth.The center of this epidemic, Wuhan city alone, hosts a population of over 10 millions.The surging demand for rapid screening and identification of 2019-nCoV posts a greatchallenge on the diagnostics.[20] mNGS is the method originally used for the identificationof this new viral species and considered as one of the most important references.[8] However,its wider application is limited by its cost and longer TAT of nearly a day. An RT-PCR assayfor 2019-nCoV is faster and more affordable. Nevertheless, the need for a thermo cycler byPCR-based diagnostics hinders its use in low-resource settings and curbs the assaythroughput. Besides their lower demand for sophisticated temperature controlling instruments,isothermal molecular methods are advantageous owing to its faster nucleic acid amplification.However, there have been debates over the specificity of such methods. The currentdiscovery of the collateral activity of certain Cas family members, provides a greatopportunity to take advantage of both the sensitivity of an isothermal assay and the specificityof the CRISPR system.[21] As we demonstrated in this study, CRISPR-nCoV was able todeliver comparable sensitivity and specificity as mNGS within as short as 40 minutes.As a result of the rapid outbreak, the targeted assays (PCR and CRISPR) were designedand developed based on limited genetic information on 2019-nCoV. Cautions should be takenthat certain unknown genomic variations may produce critical impact on the assay efficiency.For example, a mutation or polymorphic site that abrupt the binding of the very 3\u2019 end of aPCR primer may cause a drastic reduction in sensitivity. Although not without its ownshortcomings on TAT and costs, NGS-based assays demonstrated a great level of sensitivityand should still be used for continuous monitoring of genetic drifts in the viral genome. Theseinformation will provide valuable insights not only from a public health standpoint, but alsoto guide necessary optimization of targeted assay development.Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.
