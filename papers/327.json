Based on an estimated \u200bR\u200b 0\u200b of 2.56 [95% CI: 2.09, 2.78], we find that the probability of a pre-quarantine introduction exceeds 50% in 131 [95% CI 72, 232] cities, including six cities with populations over two million people with no reported cases as of January 27th.", "text": "Lastname al., DD MMM YYYY \u2013 preprint copy - BioRxivA novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China \u200b(1)\u200b. As of January 26, 2020there were 56 reported fatalities and 618 laboratory-confirmed cases in Wuhan, 1463 additionalcases spread across 217 cities in Mainland China, \u200band 56 exported cases in 14 countries spanningAsia, Europe and North America. The rapid global expansion, rising fatalities, unknown animalreservoir, and evidence of person-to-person transmission potential \u200b(2,3)\u200b resemble the 2003 SARSepidemic and raise concerns about global spread.On January 22nd, China announced a travel quarantine of Wuhan and, by January 26th, enlargedthe radius to include 14 cities totalling 41 million people. At the time of the quarantine, Chinawas already two weeks into the forty-day Spring Festival period, during which hundreds ofmillions of people travel to celebrate the Lunar New Year \u200b(4)\u200b. \u200bBased on the timing of exportedcases reported outside of China, we estimate that only 2.4% of 2019-nCoV cases may have beendetected in Wuhan by January 22, 2020 (see Appendix for details). The low detection ratecoupled with \u200ban average lag of 10 days between infection and detection \u200b(5,6)\u200b suggests that newlyinfected cases that traveled out of Wuhan just prior to the quarantine may still be infectious andundetected in \u200bdozens of Chinese cities. Moreover, these silent importations may have alreadyseeded sustained outbreaks that are not yet apparent.We estimated the probability of 2019-nCoV importations from Wuhan to cities throughout Chinabefore January 23rd using a simple model of exponential growth coupled with a stochastic modelof human mobility among 370 Chinese cities (see Appendix). Given that 98% of all trips duringthis period are taken by train or car, our analysis of air, rail and road travel data yields moregranular risk estimates than possible with air passenger data alone \u200b(7)\u200b.By fitting our epidemiological model to data on the first 19 cases reported outside of China, weestimate an \u200bR\u200b 0\u200b of 2.56 (95% CI: 2.09, 2.78) and 15,364 (95% CI: 1,447, 196,313) cumulativeinfections in Wuhan up to January 22nd (see Appendix for details). Based on these rates of earlyepidemic growth, \u200b131 \u200bcities have at least a 50% chance of having had 2019-nCoV caseimportations from Wuhan in the three weeks preceding the Wuhan quarantine (Figure 1). ByJanuary 26th, 109 of these high risk cities had reported cases and 22 had not, including five citieswith importation probabilities exceeding 99% and populations over two million people:Bazhong, Fushun, Laibin, Ziy\u200bang, and Chuxiong. Under o\u200bur upper bound estimate for epidemicgrowth (\u200bR\u200b 0\u200b =2.78), 232 of the 370 cities lie above the 50% importation risk threshold.This risk assessment identified several cities throughout China likely to be harboring yetundetected cases of 2019-nCoV and suggests that early 2020 ground and rail travel seeded casesfar beyond the Wuhan region quarantine.quarantine. \u200b(a) Daily travel volume to and from Wuhan, given as a proportion of the Wuhanpopulation.

We obtained mobility data from the location-based services (LBS) of Tencent(\u200bhttps://heat.qq.com/\u200b). Users permit Tencent to collect their real-time location information whenthey install apps (e.g., WeChat, QQ, and Tencent Map). From the geolocation of their users overtime, Tencent reconstructed anonymized origin-destination mobility matrices by mode oftransportation (air, road and train) between 370 cities in China. The data are anonymized andinclude 25 and 29 million trips to and from Wuhan, respectively, between \u200bDecember 10, 2017 toJanuary 24, 2018\u200b. We estimate daily travel volume throughout the three weeks preceding theWuhan quarantine (\u200bDecember 8, 2019 - January 22, 2020\u200b) by aligning the dates of the LunarNew Year, resulting in a three day shift. To infer the number of new infections in Wuhan per daybetween December 8, 2019, and January 22, 2020, we use the mean daily number of passengerstravelling to the top 20 foreign destination from Wuhan between January 1 and March 31, 2018,which are provided in a recent study \u200b(8)\u200b.        We consider a simple hierarchical model to describe the dynamics of 2019-nCoV infections,detections and spread.(1) Epidemiological modelWe make the following assumptions regarding the number of new casesWuhan per day \u200bt\u200b :infected in\u25cf The 2019-nCoV epidemic was growing exponentially between December 08, 2019 andJanuary 22, 2020:,where denotes the number of initial cases on December 08, 2019, andthe epidemic growth rate between December 08, 2019, and January 22, 2020.denotes\u25cf After infection, new cases were detected with a delay of \u200bD \u200b = 10 days \u200b(9)\u200b, whichcomprises an incubation period of 5-6 days \u200b(        Under these assumptions, the number of infectious cases at time \u200bt\u200b is given byand the prevalence of infectious cases is given bywhere,=11.08 millio\u200bn is the population size of Wuhan.(2) Mobility model based on the Poisson processWe assume that visitors to Wuhan have the same daily risk of infection as residents of Wuhan.Risk of exportation from infected residents\u200b : Under this assumption, the rate at which infectedresidents of Wuhan travel to city \u200bj\u200b on day \u200bt\u200b is , where \u200bis the\u200b number ofWuhan\u2019s local residents that travel to city \u200bj \u200b on day \u200bt.Risk of exportation from infected travelers\u200b : Similarly, the rate at which travelers from city \u200bj\u200b getinfected and return to their home city while still infected is , where is thenumber of travelers from city \u200bj\u200b to Wuhan on day \u200bt\u200b . We make the simplifying assumption thatnewly infected visitors to Wuhan will return to their home city while still infectious.Assuming that the introduction of cases from the epidemic origin, Wuhan, to each city \u200bj\u200b isessentially a non-homogeneous Poisson process \u200b(14\u201316)\u200b, we can calculate the probability ofintroducing at least one case from Wuhan to city \u200bj\u200b by day \u200bt\u200b using .We applied a likelihood-based method to estimate our model parameters, including the numberof initial cases and the epidemic growth rate , from the arrival times of the 19 reportedcase importation from Wuhan to cities outside of China, as of January 22, 2020. All 19 caseswere Wuhan residents (See Table \u200bS1\u200b). We aggregated all other cities without cases reported byJanuary 22, 2020 into a single location (\u200bj\u200b = 0).Let denote the number of Wuhan resident cases detected in location \u200bj\u200b outside of China, anddenote the arrival time of the \u200bi\u200b -th resident case detected in location \u200bj\u200b . Let and \u200bE\u200b denotethe start and end of the study period, respectively. As indicated above, the daily rate of infectedresidents of Wuhan arriving in location \u200bj\u200b at time \u200bt\u200b is .
