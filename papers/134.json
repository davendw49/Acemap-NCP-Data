Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated uponadmission insignificantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 andMurray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for theprogression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showedthe biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC)calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showedthat the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with diseasedeterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report biomarkers that closelyassociated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19. These findings add toour understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection,providing novel therapeutic targets and strategy.363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859Coronaviruses are the largest known viruses with a single positive- sense genome ofabout 31Kb which could infect a wide range of different species, and mainly infectrespiratory and intestinal tract causing a wide range of symptoms 1. Six members ofcoronaviruses that have been found to infect human beings, including HCoV-229E,HCoVOC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV) 1,2. Until recently, human infection with the novel severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was firstly identified in lateDecember, 2019, in Wuhan, China 3,4. As of Feb. 29, 2020, a total of 79824Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases with 2870 fatal cases were reported 5.Furthermore, another 53 countries have also reported COVID-19 cases, posing aserious threat of public health 6. Studies have revealed that penumonia is the mostcommon complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and followed by acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 7,8. Inflammation is the body\u2019s first coordinatedline of defense against tissue damage caused by either injury or infection, involvingactivating both the innate and adaptive immune responses 9. However, exuberantimmune responses following infection have been described as a cytokine storm,associated with excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and widespread tissuedamage including ARDS 10.Cytokine storm has been found during the infection of influenza viruses 11-16 aswell as coronavirues 17-24, and contributes to acute lung injury and development of2ARDS . Preliminary studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggerscytokine storm, and results in the increase of a variety of cytokine/chemokine 25,26.However, the detailed role of cytokines in diseases severity and progression remainsunknown. In this study, we recruited 53 COVID-19 cases with 34 severe cases and 19616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384moderate cases defined according to China National Health Commission Guidelinesfor Diagnosis and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and analyzed the plasmacytokine/chemokine profile in detail. Most of the severe cases (73.5%) were \u2265 60years-old, while the moderate cases were mainly in the group of 16-59 years-old(63.2%) (Table S1). The initial symptoms, co-existing chronic medical conditions,intervals of illness onset to admission and antiviral treatment were similar betweenthe two groups. Complications occurred more frequently in the severe cases,including ARDS, respiratory failure, hepatic and renal insufficiency (Table S1). Acomplete blood count with differential was assessed for each patient either on the dateof hospital admission, or at the earliest time-point and thereafter (Table 1). Thepercentage of lymphocyte (LYM) and neutrophil (NEU) as well as the CD4 and CD8counts were significantly lower in the severe cases, indicating a possible dysfunctionof immune responses.Then the expression profile of cytokines/chemokines of COVID-19 cases uponadmission was analyzed. Elevated concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatorycytokines were observed in these cases including IFN-\u03b3 (interferon, IFN), IL-1ra(interleukin, IL), IL-2ra, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), MCP-3(monocyte chemotactic protein-3),MIG (monokine induced gamma interferon),M-CSF(macrophagecolonystimulatingfactor),G-CSF(granulocytecolony-stimulatingfactor),MIG-1a(macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha)CTACK (cutaneous T-cell-attracting chemokine)andIP-10(interferongammainduced protein 10), when compared with healthy control, indicating that cytokinestorm occurred following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1) as previously reported 3,25.Similar phenomenon was also observed in SARS-CoV 17-21 and MERS-CoV 22-24infected patients , despite that the expression profiles were virus specific. Meanwhile,8687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109we compared the plasma cytokine/chemokine levels collected from severe andmoderate cases at different days after illness onset (d.a.o). The results showed thatmost of the cytokines were comparable between the two groups and maintained highlevel even at the later stage of the disease (\u2265 15 d.a.o). However, IP-10, MCP-3,IL-1ra and MIG were significantly higher in samples from severe cases in all the threegroups of sample collection time, even though statistical significance was notobserved in IL-1ra and MIG. Notably, IP-10 in the severe cases possessed a high andsimilar expression level at all groups of sample collection time. On the contrary, IP-10in moderate cases was significantly lower and further decreased a lot at \u2265 15 d.a.o.Moreover, comparison of these fourteen cytokines between the severe and moderatecases showed significantly higher levels of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in the severecases (Figure 1). Spearman rank coefficient correlation analysis showed that IP-10,MCP-3 and IL-1ra expression levels were highly correlated with PaO2/FaO2 andMurray scores. Interestingly, the viral load (displayed as Ct values) showed obviouscorrelation with only IP-10, while not MCP-3 and IL-1ra, as well as the PaO2/FaO2and Murray scores (Figure S2). Our previous study has found that the viral sheddingin COVID-19 cases is complicated and the viral loads obtained from the regularlyused upper respiratory specimens might not consistent with the real case, especiallyfor the severe cases 27. Meanwhile, the main distribution of viruses in the severe andmoderate cases were also different, which might influence the induction of cytokinesas well. Indeed, studies have found that high viral loads in some types of viralinfections correlated with severe diseases 28-30, while not for all of them 31. Theseresults suggested that the production of specific cytokines while not the viral burdenmight play central in the pathogenesis COVID-19.We further analyzed whether these cytokines could be used as predictors for the111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134disease severity and progression of COVID-19. Firstly, we calculated the receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) of each single cytokine using the expression levelsupon admission. Results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC waswe tested the different combination of these cytokines for the prediction of diseaseprogression. Combinations of the three cytokines showed the highest AUC of 0.943,followed by the combination of IP-10 and MCP-3 (0.927) as well as the combinationof IP-10 and IL-1ra (0.923) (Figure 3). Furthermore, we analyzed the serial change ofthe three cytokines in 14 severe cases. In the two fatal cases (cases 1 and 2), theexpression levels were significantly high upon admission and maintained high levelsduring the disease progression. Meanwhile, five cases (cases 7~9, 11 and 13) withcontinuously high levels of these cytokines, especially IP-10 and MCP-3, were still incritical condition. On the contrary, cases 3~6, 10, 12 and 14 with lower levels orsignificantlydecreasedlevelsofthesecytokinesshowedan obviousimprovement of the disease, and became moderate cases (cases 4, 10, 12 and 14) ordischarged from hospital (cases 3, 5, 6 and 10). These results indicated that thesethree cytokines could be considered as biomarkers to predict disease progression andoutcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections.Cytokine storm with uncontrolled proinflammatory responses induce significantimmunopathology and severe disease outcomes during some viral infections,indicating an important role in the pathogenesis of these viruses 2,32. Accordingly, notonly the pathogens but also the pathogen induced cytokine storm should beconsidered during the treatment. Therapy strategy with a combination of antimicrobialand immunotherapy may produce a more favorable outcome 9. Corticosteroids whichcould downregulate proinflammatory cytokine transcription and subsequently inhibit136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151the cytokine storm 33, and the antiviral cytokine interferon-\u03b1 were widely used duringthe treatment of COVID-19 8,34. However, use of high-dose corticosteroids has beenshown to be associated with an increase in mortality and significantly longerdurations of viral shedding in H7N9 infected patients 35, which is of concern. Theresults of our study suggested a crucial role of IP-10 in the pathogenesis ofSARS-CoV-2, which has also been shown to be associated with disease severity ofH5N1, H1N1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 16,24,29,36. A recent study has found thatIP-10 (CXCL10)-CXCR3 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the exacerbationof the pathology of ARDS 37. Thus, modulators such as antibody targeting IP-10might be a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDSto ameliorates acute lung injury as shown in H1N1 mouse model 37,38.In summary, we compared the differences of cytokines profiles between severe andmoderate COVID-19 cases, and found that IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra weresignificantly associated with disease severity and progression of COVID-19. Ourresults added to our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms ofSARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy using modulators orantibodies against theses cytokines, especially IP-10.153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174Subjects presented in this study were hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N=53), amongwhom 34 were defined as severe cases according to China National HealthCommission Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.Healthy controls (N=8) were also included. Clinical information and laboratory resultwere collected at the earliest time-point after hospitalization. The study protocol wasapproved by the Ethics Committees of Shenzhen Third People\u2019s Hospital(SZTHEC2016001). Informed consents were obtained from all patients or patientsfamily members. The study was conducted in accordance with the InternationalConference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and theDeclaration of Helsinki and institutional ethics guidelines.Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)qRT-PCR were done as previously reported 26,34. In brief, throat swabs, nasal swabs,sputum and BALF specimens were collected from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19cases upon admission and thereafter. Viral RNAs were extracted from clinicalspecimens using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). A ChinaFood and Drug Administration (CDFA) approved commercially kit (GeneoDX Co.,Shanghai, China) were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific RNAs.Samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value \u2264 37.0 were considered putatively positive.Samples whose Ct was higher than 37 were re-tested and considered positive if Ctwas \u226537 but \u2264 40 and negative if viral RNAs were undetectable on the second test.176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196197Disease severity classification and Murray Score calculation were evaluated aspreviously reported 26. Severity of 2019-nCoV infection was graded according toChina National Health Commission Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment ofSARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory confirmed patients with fever, respiratorymanifestations and radiological findings indicative of pneumonia were consideredmoderate cases (COVID-19-M). Laboratory confirmed patients who met any of thefollowing were considered to have severe COVID-19 (COVID-19-S): 1) respiratorydistraction (respiration rate\u226530/min; 2) resting oxygen saturation\u226493%, or 3) arterialoxygen partial pressure (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) \u2264300 mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133 kPa). Laboratory confirmed patients who had any of the followingwere considered in critical condition: 1) respiratory failure requiring mechanicalventilation, 2) shock, or 3) failure of other organs requiring intensive care unit (ICU).The partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood taken from the patients atvarious time-points after hospitalization is measured by the ABL90 blood gasanalyzer (Radiometer). The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is calculated by thefollowing formula: FiO2 = (21 + oxygen flow (in units of l/min) \u00d7 4) /100. ThePaO2/FiO2 ratio (in units of mmHg) is calculated by dividing the PaO2 value with theFiO2 value. A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 100 mmHg is considered one ofthe criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Murray Scorewere calculated as reported 39.The plasma of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (N=53) were199200201202203204205206207208209210211collected at the earliest possible time-point after hospitalization and thereafter. Theplasma of healthy subjects (N=8) were included as the negative control group. Theconcentrations of 48 cytokines and chemokines were measured using Bio-Plex ProHuman Cytokine Screening Panel (Bio-Rad) as previously reported 15,26.Fisher exact test was used to compare the indicated rates between the moderate andsevere cases. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare plasma cytokine levelsbetween two groups. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used for linearcorrelation analysis between the expression level of plasma cytokine and PaO2/FiO2ratio, Murray score as well as viral loads of COVID-19 cases. The area under thereceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of plasma cytokine levels wasestimated for the moderate and severe cases. All statistical tests were calculated usingSPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM, Chicago, USA). P value less than 0.05 was consideredstatistically significant.213References1234567891011Channappanavar, R. & Perlman, S.

Ourresults added to our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms ofSARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy using modulators orantibodies against theses cytokines, especially IP-10.153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174Subjects presented in this study were hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N=53), amongwhom 34 were defined as severe cases according to China National HealthCommission Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)qRT-PCR were done as previously reported 26,34. Viral RNAs were extracted from clinicalspecimens using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). Theplasma of healthy subjects (N=8) were included as the negative control group. Theconcentrations of 48 cytokines and chemokines were measured using Bio-Plex ProHuman Cytokine Screening Panel (Bio-Rad) as previously reported 15,26.Fisher exact test was used to compare the indicated rates between the moderate andsevere cases. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare plasma cytokine levelsbetween two groups. A Novel Coronavirus Genome Identified in a Cluster ofPneumonia Cases \u2014 Wuhan, China 2019\u22122020.
