Hilde De Clerck, emerging infections adviser with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, made the point that some health systems are already well organised and have able leadership but will have to adapt to respond successfully to an outbreak. South Africa's National Institute of Communicable Diseases and Senegal's Institut Pasteur were initially the only referral laboratories on the continent, and so were responsible for testing samples from other African countries. By Feb 4, more countries-Ghana, Madagascar, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria-were also able to do testing themselves. As of Feb 10, WHO said that 11 countries were capable of testing for 2019\u00ad nCoV, and reagents should be delivered to other countries this week. Africa's preparedness eforts have been boosted with $25 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with some of it going towards training. 15 experts from the African Union received training on laboratory diagnosis for 2019\u00ad nCoV in Dakar, Senegal, on Feb 6-8. WHO is also supporting training in Ethiopia and other countries on isolation and treatment and care of infected patients.", "text": "On Jan 30, WHO Director\u00ad GeneralDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesusdeclared that the novel coronavirus(2019\u00ad nCoV) epidemic, centred inChina, was a public health emergencyof international concern.
