Background: Since the outbreak of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19), manyresearchers in China have immediately carried out clinical research scheme of the COVID-19. But,there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the firstsystematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the controlof the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and theClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. Theretrieval inception date is February        As an emerging infectious diseases, coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) seriouslythreatens human health 1-3. In December 2019, the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city,Hubei province of China, was suspected to be related to the seafood market, while the host ofnovel coronavirus was suspected to be the chrysanthemum head bat 4-7. Patients with COVID-19will have different respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as fever, cough, pneumonia, andeven death 8-9. It is estimated that the death rate of the virus disease is about 2% - 4% according toa recent survey 8, 10. By Feb 30, 2020, more than 80,000 people have been infected around theworld, most of them are in China (Figure 1). At present, there are different numbers of infectedpeople in all provinces of China, and Hubei province is the most serious regions (Figure 2), andthe signs of infection outbreak are obvious. In addition, more than 40 countries around the worldhave also seen new cases of COVID-19 11-15. As a result, the COVID-19 brings great challenges topublic health in the world 10, 16.Given the COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, scientists still know little about it. Atpresent, the COVID-19 lacks effective treatment drugs. To date, no clinical intervention trial hasbeen completed and reported. Due to the urgent situation of treatment and prevention and controlof the disease, it is necessary to research and develop effective intervention methods of COVID-19to facilitate disease control. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, many researchers in China haveimmediately carried out clinical research scheme, aiming to solve the treatment, prevention anddiagnosis of the COVID-19. However, up to now, there is still a lack of systematic review toanalyze the characteristics and existing problems of registered clinical trials. Therefore, weconduct the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidencefor the control of the COVID-19.This review was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews ofInterventions 17 and presented based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-analyses guidelines 18.The inclusion criteria of this study are: patients with COVID-19; clinical trial with protocol;involves the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of COVID-19; have clear and specific end-pointoutcomes; design type can be any type of study design.clinical trials.        The exclusion criteria of this study are: animal trials; theoretical research; and unregisteredThe literature retrieval was independently completed by two researchers. The databases of theChinese Clinical Trial Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were included. There was nolanguage limit for the search, and the search deadline was February        The extracted data mainly include registration number, project name, research leader, age,research type, study design, sponsor, implementation unit, start time, completion period, researchsite, research institute, stage, research object, inclusion standard, exclusion standard, sample size,setting, location, recruitment period, intervention group measures, control group measures,random methods, blind methods, distribution concealment and measurement indicators. All theevaluated literature was independently conducted by two researchers.The quality evaluation and data extraction of each literature that met the inclusion criteriawas conducted independently and cross-check was carried out by two researchers. When theopinions were inconsistent, final decisions were decided by two researchers through discussion.The Interventional clinical trial was based on Cochrane risk of bias items: randomization sequencegeneration, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcomeassessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias [19]. The observationalstudy was based on the quality evaluation by Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) [20].This review presented a narrative synthesis. This study mainly analyzed and summarized thetypes of studies, intervention, host organization and address, sample size, research stage, researchstatus, excepted completion time, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome measurement andobservation time, methodology quality and describes the results with statistics and characteristicsrespectively. Nonparametric data was represented by median and 95% CI and the statisticalanalysis used MedCalc statistical software (version 15.2.2, MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend,Belgium; http://www.medcalc.org; 2015). The bias plot was performed by Review Manager(RevMan) [Computer program](version 5.2, Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The        Up to February        In addition to the two observational trials from France (NCT04262921, NCT04259892), theothers were sponsored by Chinese organizations. These organizations are responsible for three ormore: the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Xinhua Hospital of Hubei University ofTraditional Chinese medicine, Hubei Integrated Hospital of Traditional Chinese and WesternMedicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital, BeijingHospital of Traditional Chinese medicine, Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine,and Tongji Hospital, etc., among which the most undertakers were the First Affiliated Hospital ofZhejiang University, 7 items in total. The addresses of the organizers are Hubei, Beijing, Zhejiang,Guangdong, Sichuan, Shanghai, etc., with the largest number of Hubei Province, totalling 25(Figure 4). From the perspective of research types, most of them are intervention control studies(63) aiming at drug therapy, followed by observation studies totalling 12 (6 studies on the efficacyof traditional Chinese medicine, 2 preventive studies, 4 studies on prognosis, rehabilitation anddevices).        Most of the trials have passed the ethical review, most of the studies are still in thepreparation stage, only 11 trials have started to recruit patients, and all the registered clinical trialshave not been completed. The first to register was on January                  In terms of trial stages, 20 trials are exploratory studies or in the preliminary experimentstage, 9 items in the extended validation of drugs on the market, only 2 trials instage(NCT0425266          The common characteristics of inclusion criteria included: signing informed consent; ageover 18 years; laboratory test (RT-PCR) confirmed infection of COVID-19 (diagnostic criteria forpneumonia diagnosis in line with \u201cProtocol of Prevention and Control of Novel CoronavirusPneumonia\u201d); chest imaging confirmed lung involvement; participants were willing to be assignedto any designated treatment group randomly; agree not to participate in another study of theinvestigator until the study was completed. Most of the subjects were limited to light (ordinarysubjects), and few of the studies included severe patients.The common characteristics of the exclusion criteria are: severe and critical patients withCOVID-19; pregnant and lactating women; allergic patients; patients with serious heart, brain,kidney, tumor, hemoglobin disease and other diseases; patients with mental disorders, drug abuseor dependence history; those who do not get informed consent; the researchers think the subject isnot suitable.The main intervention methods of registered clinical trials include traditional Chinesemedicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated traditional and Western medicinetreatment, etc.; the outcome of treatment observation mainly includes clinical rehabilitation time,the incidence of using mechanical ventilation, the incidence in ICU, mortality, all kinds ofcomplications and virological detection indicators, etc.; the medication methods mainly includeoral, injection, atomization inhalation, etc.; the majority of medication time is more than one week.The time limit of outcome observation was more than 2-4 weeks. The controls were mainly treatedwith placebo or routine treatmentIn the registered clinical trials, there are 32 western medicine treatments, and the interventionmethods mainly include: i) antiviral drugs, such as: rhetcivir, abidol, fabiravir, chloroquinephosphate, asc09/ritonavir compound tablets, lopinavir/ritonavir (Coriolus), hydroxychloroquine,chloroquine, baloxavir, darunavir/Corbis, etutabine/propofol tenofovir, etc.; ii) antiviral drugcombination biological agents, for example: lucotinib combined with mesenchymal stem celltherapy, recombinant cytokine-gene derivedprotein injection combinedwith abidol orlopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant virus macrophage inflammatory protein for aerosol inhalationinjection or lopinavir/ritonavir tablets combined with thymosin A1, lopinavir/ritonavir andinterferon-\u03b12b; iii) biological agents (products), for example: uterine blood stem cells, interferon,cord blood mononuclear cells, cord mesenchymal stem cell-conditioned medium, recombinantcytokine gene-derived protein, immunoglobulin, etc.; and iv) steroid therapy, for example,glucocorticoid (intervention in critical patients).There are 22 clinical registration trials treated with traditional Chinese medicine. TraditionalChinese medicine treatment drugs are mainly various kinds of compound Chinese herbalmedicines (decoction, capsule,granule, etc.), includingLianhuaqingwencapsule, etc.Themain ingredients areantiviral andimmunomodulatory Chinese herbal formulas. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine treatmentalso involves some injections from herbal extract, such as Shuanghuanglian Injection, Xue-Bi-JingThere are 6 clinical registration trials of the combination of Chinese medicine and Westernmedicine, and the intervention means is to use the combination of the above Chinese herbs andThe observation outcomes included: cure rate, cure time, incidence of adverse outcomes,clinical improvement time, ratio of normal progression to severe disease, time to heavyprogression, death, virus nucleic acid copies, coronavirus nucleic acid conversion time,pneumonia severity index, Murray lung injury score, chest CT, the survival rate and mortality ofpatients.Additionally, some laboratory tests novel coronavirus were also selected, including routineblood test, urine routine test, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,muscle enzyme, troponin, myoglobin, D dimer, blood gas analysis, coagulation routine, newcoronavirus nucleic acid examination, and T cell subgroup analysis, hospital length etc.The follow-up timing of the outcome measure is mostly 2-4 weeks, but some studies do notset forth a plan.According to the Cochrane bias risk assessment results (Figure 5), the quality assessment ofthe interventional study methodology is generally low. Most trials reported randomization, whilethe other trials had high risk of biases in randomization (17 trials did not mention randomizationand 6 trials were judged as non-randomized trials)\uff1bFew trials conducted distribution concealment;only nine trials implemented blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessment; None ofthe 63 trials clarified drop-out and follow-up bias. However, other bias risks, such as the risk ofconflict of interest among drug manufacturers, are unclear.The NOS scores of the observational trials are from 4 to 6 (Table 3). Most of theobservational trials have high risk of biases in assessment outcome, follow-up of outcome andadequacy of follow up of cohorts (Figure 6). Therefore, the overall quality of registeredobservational trials is low.COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, which is still poorly understood, so there is norecognized effective treatment. This sudden health incident has caused great harm to China andseriously threatened people's health 21-23. In order to deal with the disease, researchers have carriedout many clinical studies intensively. According to the search results, the current studies areconcentrated in China, mainly involving the treatment and intervention of traditional Chinesemedicine, Western medicine and the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine.Clinical research institutes are mainly hospitals of China. As far as the stage was concerned, mostof the studies are still the exploratory research or in pre-experiment stage, and there are nineextended validation studies of the indications of drugs on the market (chloroquine phosphate,abidol, fabiravir, asc09/ritonavir compound tablets, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine,chloroquine), etc., while only two of the three-phase clinical trials. From the perspective of samplesize, the intervention trials are small sample studies, hence, the evidence level is low and theclinical significance will be limited.At present, the treatment of this disease is mainly antiviral, improving patients' immunity,intervening in autoimmune damage (against immune storm caused by cytokines) and symptomatictreatment. According to the in vitro cell test, the antiviral effect of Western drugs is obviouslysuperior to that of traditional Chinese medicine (the concentration value of the inhibitory effect islow). But considering that Chinese herbs have both antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, it hasa certain application prospect in disease prevention and treatment; at present, the combination ofandWesternMedicine (Qingfeipaidutangandchloroquinephosphate, abidol,lopinavir/Rito) is considered as a better treatment method by experts, and has been listed in\u201cProtocol of Prevention and Control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia\u201d, but there is still a lack ofhigh-quality evidence, which needs clinical verification.          According to the existing preliminary evidence, the antiviral drug Remdesivir (twothree-phase clinical trials for light, moderate and heavy patients respectively, expected to end onApril 2          In this review, we found that many trials used biological products for immunotherapy of thedisease. In light of the experience and lessons of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 30-31,steroid therapy has been used cautiously in the treatment of the disease, so there are few trialsbased on the retrieval results.From the perspective of inclusion and exclusion criteria, some people were excluded, such aschildren and adolescents, pregnant women, patients with serious liver and kidney damage.Therefore, this will lead to the lack of clinical evidence in this part of the population.The outcomes of clinical trial observation includes clinical observation outcomes, physicalexamination and laboratory test results, but some outcomes are subjective, which may causemeasurement bias.Based on Cochrane risk of bias items and NOS, we evaluated the quality of intervention trialsand observational trials, respectively. The evaluation results showed that the overall quality ofregistered clinical research was low. Therefore, it indicates that most of the registered clinicalstudies have a greater risk of bias, and the level of evidence is relatively low in the future, whichbelittles the practice significance of the research. We believed that the main reasons for the lowquality of the registered clinical trial protocols are: i) the researchers' clinical research ability isnot enough, and ii) the researchers lack experience in dealing with sudden health events.We believed that it is necessary to improve the quality of research and to the registeredclinical research programmes in strict accordance with the guidelines for clinical trials 32-35. Inaddition, current clinical trials by different hospitals conducted spontaneously are not effectivelyorganized and coordinated, so more scattered and disorderly. Some drugs that have not been testedin vitro or whose safety is of great concern are also being tested in clinical trials, which not onlyincrease the risk of clinical trials, but also waste research resources. Hence, the NationalAdministration of scientific research should strengthen their management and coordination and asmall number of promising drugs, such as Remdesivir, should be prioritized for clinical trials andallowed to run smoothly.From these registered clinical studies, we found a serious limitation: most of the registeredclinical research did not consider the \"timeliness\", and still followed the conservative traditionalstudy design paradigm. The research duration was more than 5 months, and the median (days) ofthe intervention research was 180 (95% CI: 146.3 \u2013 328.9), which is very unfavorable for thecurrent urgent situation. We believed that, in the current situation, we should pay more attention to\"timeliness\" in the design of clinical trials (otherwise, the epidemic situation may have ended afterdrug approval; the research also lost its social significance). Therefore, in response to thisemerging public health event, we can refer to the \"sequential design\" for clinical trials; \"sequentialdesign\" not only saves the sample size, but also significantly shortens the research period, so it isvery conducive to the screening and discovery of some drugs with significant efficacy 36-37. Inaddition, a very difficult problem is the treatment of severe and critical patients with COVID-19.For these patients, we suggested that: based on the \"compassionate use drug\" principle, with safeand obvious antiviral potential drugs, to conduct a staged small batch and single-arm clinical trialsis feasible. We believed that \"compassionate use drug\" can not only meet the special needs ofpatients but also carry out clinical effectiveness observation, research and analysis, so as toimprove the research efficiency and benefit patients 38-42. Also, given a large number of clinicalcases have accumulated information, and using available existing data for statistics and analysiswith the help of new statistical methods such as clinical data-mining 43-45 and real-world study 46-48,etc., can also quickly obtain some very valuable information and save research time.In brief, under the condition that there are a large number of cases to be selected at present, itis of great value for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 to try to complete various clinicaltrial designs and data analysis scientifically and efficiently with a variety of clinical researchdesigns and statistical analysis methods, and researchers should try in future.Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine andWestern medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor qualityand small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable,high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. Inorder to effectively deal with the current sudden health emergencies, the National Administrationof scientific research should strengthen their management and coordination to improve the studyquality based on the guidelines for clinical trials. Also, it is important to ensure that somepromising projects are prioritized. In addition, we suggest that using a variety of study designs andstatistical methods to scientifically and efficiently conduct the clinical trials, which has anextremely important value for the control of COVID-19.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.Table 1 Summary of intervention registered clinical trials.No1ChiCTR2000029638LMulticenter randomized controlled trial for

But,there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Patients with COVID-19will have different respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as fever, cough, pneumonia, andeven death 8-9. As a result, the COVID-19 brings great challenges topublic health in the world 10, 16.Given the COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, scientists still know little about it. To date, no clinical intervention trial hasbeen completed and reported. The quality evaluation and data extraction of each literature that met the inclusion criteriawas conducted independently and cross-check was carried out by two researchers. When theopinions were inconsistent, final decisions were decided by two researchers through discussion. This study mainly analyzed and summarized thetypes of studies, intervention, host organization and address, sample size, research stage, researchstatus, excepted completion time, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome measurement andobservation time, methodology quality and describes the results with statistics and characteristicsrespectively. with the largest number of Hubei Province, totalling 25(Figure 4). Therefore, the overall quality of registeredobservational trials is low. COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, which is still poorly understood, so there is norecognized effective treatment. In order to deal with the disease, researchers have carriedout many clinical studies intensively. As far as the stage was concerned, mostof the studies are still the exploratory research or in pre-experiment stage, and there are nineextended validation studies of the indications of drugs on the market (chloroquine phosphate,abidol, fabiravir, asc09/ritonavir compound tablets, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine,chloroquine), etc., From the perspective of samplesize, the intervention trials are small sample studies, hence, the evidence level is low and theclinical significance will be limited. Some drugs that have not been testedin vitro or whose safety is of great concern are also being tested in clinical trials, which not onlyincrease the risk of clinical trials, but also waste research resources. Also, given a large number of clinicalcases have accumulated information, and using available existing data for statistics and analysiswith the help of new statistical methods such as clinical data-mining 43-45 and real-world study 46-48,etc., can also quickly obtain some very valuable information and save research time. In addition, we suggest that using a variety of study designs andstatistical methods to scientifically and efficiently conduct the clinical trials, which has anextremely important value for the control of COVID-19.The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
