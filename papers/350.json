Using an electronic questionnaire, we surveyed a nationalsample of PCPs to assess their response to novel coronavirus outbreak.Methods From Jan 28, 2020 to Feb 3, 2020, we invited a national random sampleof PCPs in China to participate in an online survey through social media. Thequestionnaire was adapted from The Notice of Improving Prevention of 2019-nCoVcausing Pneumonia in Primary Care Settings issued by China\u2019s National HealthCommission on Jan 27, 2020.5 It included 6 questions of demographic information,duration and scope of clinical practice as well as types of practice settings, and 8statements regarding whether the PCPs were making efforts to respond to novelcoronavirus outbreak in daily practice.Eligible PCPs participated in this survey voluntarily and were not compensated.Once completed and returned, the survey was regarded as informed consent byparticipants. This study was deemed exempt from review by the Sir Run Run ShawResults Among 1751 respondents (response rate: 62%), 784 (45%) were men and1135 (65%) were family physicians. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 38(8)years, and the duration of practice was 15 (9) years (Table 1). Most of PCPs wereproactive in studying knowledge and skills of containing 2019-nCoV (99%, n=1741),teaching their consulting patients ways of prevention (94%, n=1650), and comfortingthe worried patients (86%, n=1509). The study also showed that 69% (n=1221) ofPCPs used online consultation for health education. However, less than half (48%,n=849) reported to transfer the suspected infected patients to hospitals for furtherdiagnosis and treatment. The rates of visiting, transferring and monitoring thesuspected cases varied among PCPs in different practice settings, geographic regions,and specialties, respectively (Table 2).We found that most of China\u2019s PCPs attached great importance to thenational epidemic outbreak and had some preparation of knowledge and skills forthe emerging situation. They took multiple control measures instructed by healthauthorities, and the majority spontaneously provide online consultation to localcommunity, which effectively increased the coverage of health services during apandemic period and strengthened the relationship between PCPs and the public.Nevertheless, the capacity of transferring suspected cases remained relativelyinadequate. Hence, China\u2019s hierarchical medical system for managing communicabledisease remains to be improved.The result that PCPs\u2019 responses varied among practitioners, regions and settingsmay be attributed to the uneven distribution of healthcare providers and resourcesacross the country. It indicates that policies for containing the coronavirus outbreakin primary care should consider different challenges PCPs encounter and adjustmeasures to individual conditions.Our study includes several limitations. First, there is a diversity of controlmeasures among districts and PCPs\u2019 response may be affected by local authorities.Second, PCPs other than clinicians are not included in our study because they are notresponsible for screening and transfer.Policy-makers should take steps to improve PCPs\u2019 capacity and consciousness toready for rapid response, and strengthen collaboration between PCPs and specialistsAuthor Contributions: Dr Yao had full access to all the data in the study and takesresponsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: All authors.Critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: All authors.1.
