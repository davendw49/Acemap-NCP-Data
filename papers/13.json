Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the e ectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of \\test-and-treat\" interventions against the human immunode ciency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.", "text": "1An epidemic can be described by its speed and strength. The speed of an epidemic ischaracterized by the exponential growth rate r, which measures how fast an epidemic grows at thepopulation level. The strength of an epidemic is characterized by the reproductive numberR, which measures how many new cases are caused by a typical individual case. Knowingthe speed and strength of an epidemic allows predictions about the course of the epidemicand the e ectiveness of intervention strategies.        Much research has prioritized estimates of R, and particularly its value in a fullysusceptible population, called the basic reproductive number R0, because R has a threshold value(i.e., R = 1) that determines whether a disease can invade, the level of equilibrium, andthe e ectiveness of control e orts        Here, we show that r can also serve as a threshold, and also provide a useful metricfor di culty of elimination. We rst generalize the idea that R measures the di culty ofelimination by showing we can measure an intervention's \\strength\" on the same scale as thereproductive number. We then show that we can likewise measure an intervention's \\speed\",and that there is a duality between the threshold R = 1 and a corresponding minimalintervention strength required for elimination, and the threshold r = 0 and a correspondingminimal intervention speed. We argue that the historical primacy of R over r is partlyarti cial, and discuss cases where strength provides the better framing for practical diseasequestions and cases where speed does.22.1          We model disease incidence using the renewal equation, a simple, exible framework thatcan cover a wide range of model structures          Zi(t) =K( ; t)i(t)d :(1)Here, K( ; t) is the infection kernel describing how infectious we expect an individual infectedtime units ago to be in the population. In general, K( ; t) will depend on populationcharacteristics that may change through time t { notably, the proportion of the populationsusceptible, S(t). Since we are interested in invasion and control, we will generally neglectchanges in K( ; t) through time. Thus, we will assume K( ; t) K( ). Importantly, this            BaselineControlledmeans we are neglecting changes in susceptible proportion through time: S(t) S(0). Underthis assumption, the renewal equation is equivalent to the Von Foerster equations (see e.g.                      Assuming that the infection kernel K doesn't change with time, we write:K( ) = Rg( );(2)where g( ) is the \\intrinsic\" generation-interval distribution. The generation interval isde ned as the time between when a person becomes infected and when that person infectsanother person          Imagine a control measure that proportionally reduces K, for example, by protecting axed fraction of susceptibles through vaccination (Fig. 1A). We then have:By analogy with the strength-based factorization (2), we can rewrite (7) as a speed-basedfactorization:          K( ) = b( ) exp(r )Like g, b is a distribution: in this case the initial backward generation interval, whichgives the distribution of realized generation times (measured from the infectee's point ofview) when the disease spreads exponentially          Now imagine an intervention that reduces transmission at a constant hazard rateacross the disease generation (Fig. 1B), for example, by identifying and isolating infectiousindividuals. We then have:K^ ( ) = K( ) exp() = b( ) exp((r          ) )This framework generalizes the work of          We de ne the strength of the intervention L to be = R=R^ . It is then straightforwardto show that is the harmonic mean of L( ) weighted by generation-interval distribution:= 1=h1=L( )ig( ):In this more general case, we have again that the disease cannot spread whenThe Euler-Lotka equation allows us to calculate the initial exponential growth rate r of anepidemic given an infection kernel K:1 =ZK( ) exp( r )dSince g is a distribution, the reduction needed to prevent invasion (or to eliminate disease)is exactly = R. We call the \\strength\" of the intervention; transmission is interruptedwhen the strength of the intervention is larger than the strength of spread R.We generalize this idea by allowing an intervention strategy to reduce K by di erentproportions over the course of an individual infection. We write the post-intervention kernel:where L( ) is the average proportional reduction for an individual infected timepost-intervention reproductive number is thus:K^ ( ) = (R= )g( ):K^ ( ) = K( )=L( );R^ = Z K^ ( )d(4)ago. The(3)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)0The associated post-intervention epidemic speed r^ is given by:Since b is a distribution (which integrates to 1), the reduction needed to prevent invasion (orto eliminate disease) is exactly = r. We call the \\speed\" of the intervention; transmissionis interrupted when the speed of the intervention is faster than the speed of spread.We generalize this idea by allowing the hazard rate h( ) at which K is reduced to varythrough time, thus:K^ ( ) = K( ) expZh( )dWe de ne the speed of a general intervention to bea (sort of) mean satisfying the implicit equation:= rr^. We can then show thatis1 = Z K^ ( ) exp( r^ )d :1 =*exp( )+exp (R0 h( )d ) b( )Speci cally, the speed is a mean of the hazard h in the sense that an increase (or decrease)in h produces the same sign of change in , and if h is constant across the generation then= h.3In this section, we use both strength- and speed-based decompositions to compare di erentintervention strategies for the human immunode ciency virus (HIV). In particular, we studyhow the amount of early HIV transmission a ects estimates of intervention e ectiveness.These examples are not detailed estimates for speci c scenarios; instead, they are meantto demonstrate how strength- and speed-based decompositions can help evaluate controlstrategies.        We model the infection kernel of the HIV as a sum of two gamma distributions:K( ) = R (pearlyfearly( ) + (1pearly)flate( )) :(13)The rst component, fearly( ), models early HIV transmission during the acute infectionstage. We assume that fearly( ) has a mean of 3 months        The infection kernel is shown in (Fig. 2A) for our baseline value of pearly = 0:23. Weassume that the initial speed of the epidemic is r = 0:452 year 1(Fig. 2B), and ask what value(10)(11)(12)0.06itys0.04neDof R0 would produce this rate of growth. When transmission is fast, (i.e., when pearly is large),individuals don't need to transmit as much to achieve this speed, so the estimated value ofR0 decreases (Fig. 2C). Therefore, as pearly gets smaller, we expect stronger intervention tobe required in order to control the disease.We compare two di erent possible intervention strategies to shed light on the speedand strength decompositions. First, we consider a condom intervention that reduces HIVtransmission by approximately 75% at the population level. Assuming that condoms act asa physical barrier, and that condom use will, on average, remain roughly constant throughtime, it is reasonable to model the proportional reduction in transmission due to condomuse as constant across the course of infection: Lcondom = 1=(1 0:75) = 4 (Fig. 3A). Theestimated strength of such an intervention is simply the average of Lcondom, i.e., = 4, whereasthe estimated strength of the epidemic decreases as the proportion of early transmissionincreases (Fig. 3B). Thus, the predicted e ectiveness of the condom intervention will dependstrongly on our estimate of the importance of early transmission: if early transmission is low,we expect disease spread to be too strong to be controlled completely by our intervention.        Next, we consider a \\test-and-treat\" strategy in which infected individuals are identi ed,linked to care and receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) with the goal of both preservinghealth and preventing transmission through viral suppression.        EpidemicIntervention5.00.2 0.3Proportion of early transmissionquickly (because sexually active individuals are the most likely to seek testing); after a fewmonths, the assumed hazard rate goes down to account for the e ects of people who avoididenti cation, persistent treatment failures, and the possibility of rare transmission evenunder e ective treatment (Fig. 4C). The corresponding strength of intervention L is shownin Fig. 4A and details of the assumption are given in the caption.        In this example, we see that, as pearly goes down and our estimate of epidemic strengthincreases, the estimate of intervention strength increases roughly in parallel. The increase inintervention strength makes sense, as we have more time to reach people on average beforethey transmit: this is the core of the result of                Though there is a clear intuition for why both strengths increase as early transmissiongoes down, the speed paradigm provides insight into why these two increases are so close toparallel. The estimated epidemic speed depends only on the observed growth rate { it doesnot change if we change our assumption about the proportion of early transmission. Forthe test-and-treat intervention, the e ective epidemic speed also stays relatively constant(Fig. 4D), in part because we have (plausibly) assumed that hazard stays relatively constantfor a few key months, and in part because the backward generation-interval distributionsfor di erent scenarios are relatively similar. The intervention speed increases slightly asproportion of early transmission increases because the subpopulation that the interventionfails to reach become relatively more important if late transmission is more important. Thus,the speed paradigm provides an intuitive underpinning for the originally surprising result of        8Time (years)12160.2 0.3Proportion of early transmission0.40.2 0.3Proportion of early transmission0.4        The e ectiveness of an epidemic intervention is often measured by its ability to reduce thereproductive number { R, or outbreak \\strength\" { below 1. The exponential growth rate{ r, or outbreak \\speed\" { is often seen just as a stepping stone to R or even overlookedentirely        In this study, we: rst extended the standard paradigm of R as critical parameter forcontrol, by de ning the strength of an intervention on the same scale as R, the strengthof the epidemic; then constructed a parallel interpretation which measures the speed of anintervention on the same scale as r, the speed of an epidemic. We thus showed that thestandard paradigm for R and control has a natural parallel interpretation in terms of r.        To illustrate this idea, we used simple assumptions to explore the e ects of two HIVintervention strategies (condoms and test-and-treat), using both strength- and speed-basedframeworks. In particular, we provided an alternative explanation for the result of                While both speed- and strength-based frameworks can give the same conclusion aboutthe outcome of an intervention, sometimes one provides a clearer understanding of a givenmeasure. For example, we expect the speed-based framework to be clearer for characterizingnewly invading pathogens: when an epidemic is growing exponentially, the reproductivenumber cannot be estimated with con dence                When comparing interventions with epidemic parameters to evaluate strategies, thesituation is similar. Some scenarios lend themselves naturally to a single approach. For example,in the classic case of vaccination to eliminate a previously established childhood disease, bothdisease spread and intervention can be clearly characterized using strength                There is an analogy here with measures of tness in theoretical ecology. For example,when a population is regulated by density dependence that a ects all individuals identically,r may be the best measure of tness                Responses to the 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa and the recent COVID-19 outbreakshow an over-emphasis on strength at the expense of speed: during the early phases of bothoutbreaks, many disease modelers tried to estimate R0 but overlooked r.
