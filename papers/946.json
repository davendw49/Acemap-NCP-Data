The case fatality ratemay be as high as 3.4% and, although the indicationsare that it is a mild, self-limiting illness for the majorityof those infected, it clearly has the potential to causesignificant disruption globally. Many countries are movingfrom the \u2018containment\u2019 to the \u2018delay\u2019 phase in controllingthe outbreak with a recent UK model suggesting apotential peak in June 2020        Occupational hygienists have particular skills inunderstanding exposure to hazards in the workplace anda long history of introducing simple and effectivemeasures that reduce risk to workers\u2019 health. These skills maybe able to contribute to protecting the global workforcefrom Covid-19.        Workers involved in healthcare have always had arecognized increase in risk of developing infectionspresent in the community where their patients are drawn.Health care workers are often on the front line dealingwith those who are ill and at the most infectious periodof a disease, as in the cases of SARS, MERS, and Ebola.Healthcare facilities can therefore act as a focus forinfection spreading, giving rise to disease clusters linked tohospitals, social care facilities, and other health locations                Other workers involved in providing services to thepublic may also be at increased risk during particularoutbreaks where transmission is through face-to-face orclose contact. A\u00a0recent analysis in the USA has estimatedthat 10% of the workforce are employed in roles whereexposure to disease or infection occurs at least onceper week        The recent spread of Covid-19 around the globe hasled to considerable anxiety and concern among workerswho understandably worry about becoming infectedand/or infecting co-workers, customers and familymembers as a result. Questions from workers have tended tocentre around three main themes:1. How does infection occur? Is it primarily byinhalation or getting droplets from cough and spittle on myhands? What degree and type of contact with aninfectious person is likely to put me at risk?2. How useful is personal protective equipment? Aremasks effective in protecting me from infection and/or protecting others from me if I\u00a0 am infectious?Should I\u00a0wear gloves or aprons?3. What other measures can I\u00a0take to change my workingbehaviour to reduce the risk of becoming infected?exposure pathways and look at ways to change howwork is carried out to help minimize the risk of exposureand infection.        Steps to interrupt the exposure pathways, forexample by disinfecting surfaces, can be helpful        Designing and recommending changes toworkspaces or how tasks are performed is the core of whathygienists do for many other workplace hazards. Thesechanges may be structural or behavioural. Structuralmeasures like simple screens and barriers used in somecustomer-facing roles including bus drivers and bankingstaff may offer some degree of protection fromCovid19 compared to the more open interactive style of workthat teachers or general shop staff undertake. It may beworth considering which roles could benefit fromphysical or distancing controls like this: pharmacists andhospital or primary care reception staff could be protectedin this\u00a0way.        Behavioural changes can also be simple. Already wehave seen changes to traditional greeting practices withhandshakes replaced by \u2018elbow bumps\u2019 or othernoncontact methods. More considered behavioural nudgesto increase personal awareness of our hand activity orlimiting the need to spend time in close contact withothers may be worthy of development to limit spread.Developing an electronic sensor to detect inadvertenttouching of the face and alerting the individual couldbe a useful innovation: this week has seen the launchof a website that uses laptop or mobile phone cameratechnology to discourage users from touching their face        There are many uncertainties around howtransmission of respiratory infections like Covid-19 occurwithin workplace settings, and there is an urgent needfor research on what control measures are likely to bemost effective both to protect workers and to preventworkers spreading disease in the communities theyserve. In particular research should seek to address thefollowing:\u2022What is the relevant importance of inhaled exposurecompared to surface contamination andhand-toperi-oral routes in the transmission of Covid-19?\u2022\u2022How effective are different types of personalprotective equipment in reducing both inhaled andsurface transmission?What simple structural and behavioural changes inthe workplace can be encouraged to reduce the riskof transmission?There is considerable expertise in the occupationalhygiene and exposure science communities that cancontribute to a better understanding of the spread ofCovid-19 and help workers contain and delaycommunity transmission.We are grateful to our colleague Dr Ruaraidh Dobson forcomments on a draft of this commentary.The authors declare they have no potential conflicts of interestin relation to this commentary.", "ref_list": [[], ["Paper money and coins as potential vectors of transmissible disease"], ["Estimating the burden of United States workers exposed to infection or disease: a key factor in containing risk of COVID-19 infection"], ["Are powered air purifying respirators a solution for protecting healthcare workers from emerging aerosol transmissible diseases?
