Despite this, diagnostic testing for speci c viruses underlying ILI is relatively rare (CDC 2019). Thisresults in a lack of information about the pathogens that make between 9 million and 49 million people sickevery year in the United States alone (CDC 2020). Yet knowledge of the speci c diseases is necessary fortimely treatment to prevent unnecessary su ering and death (Nguyen 2016, Van Asten et al. 2012,          ILI is de ned by the CDC as fever of 100 F and a cough and/or a sore throat without a known cause otherthan in uenza (CDC 2020). De ning ILI as a cluster of symptoms rather than a speci c disease or diseasesis necessary for keeping track of case counts, as well as for important analysis and forecasting (Osthus andMoran 2019). However, the cluster of symptoms known as ILI is caused by many under-lying pathogens          We conducted a literature review to establish plausible ranges for model parameters, and developed adeterministic system of ordinary di erential equations to model the general dynamics of these ve viruses.2.1medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020404.

ILI Review page 3adenovirus was identified in 8.1% of samples, human coronavirus in 8.8%, RSV in 13.5i%n, uenza in 21.3%,and rhinovirus in 22.6%. Coinfection was not taken into account in these estimates.2.2In view of the current outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, and given the need for plausibleparameters for modeling e orts, we conducted an in-depth literature review for human coronavirus.2019-nCoV has been identi ed as a member of genus betacoronavirus, along with SARS and MERS(WHO 2020). Until the genomes of 2019-nCoV have been further characterized, it seems reasonable tosuspend assumptions about the epidemiological behavior of the novel virus, and to include all knownstrains in the parameter sets. Thus, our review includes values for strains 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1,SARS, and MERS. Means have been collected when possible; when not available, medians have beenrecorded. Information on the studies, the strains, the sample sizes, and the references is availableon pages 26-27 of this paper.We included values for R0 only for SARS and MERS, and attempted to include them only for the periodbefore large-scale interventions were implemented, since R0 is de ned as the average number of sec-ondaryinfections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a fully susceptible population (K.Deitz, 1975). Since the seasonal strains of human coronavirus are endemic in the world, there is, byde nition, no fully susceptible population for 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 in which R0 may be assessed.Results of our review for human coronavirus include the following mean values: an incubation periodof 5.01 days, an infectious period of 15.2 days, a hospitalization period of 4.96 days, a hospitalizedproportion of 0.188, a case fatality proportion of 0.147, and an R0 of 3.7.33.1The model diagram (Fig.1) illustrates the progression of in uenza-like illness (ILI) in a human populationof a hypothetical small city containing 10,000 individuals. We assume density-dependence, that is, for axed population of 10,000 humans with negligible migration, the contact rate for individuals remainsconstant.The total population (N) consists of seven classes: susceptible (S), exposed but not infectious (E), rstinfectious class (I1), second infectious class (I2), hospitalized (H), recovered (R), or dead (D). Individ-ualsare considered susceptible until they contact an infectious individual from (I1), (I2), or (H). Given contactwith an infectious individual, transmission takes place with some probability. After transmission of thevirus has occurred, susceptible people move to the exposed class (E), where they spend a number of daysequal to the mean period of time between infection and the onset of infectiousness (the latent period). Weassume here that the latent period equals the incubation period, or the mean period of time betweenexposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms. After the latent period, they move to the rst infectiousclass (I1). The mean duration of the rst infectious period di ers according to the underlying virus.Symptoms worsen for some proportion of the rst infectious class, who enter the hospital (H), where theyremain infectious. Individuals who do not enter the hospital remain ill outside the hospital for the durationof the second infectious period (I2). From (I2), the length of which di ers according to the underlying virus,where we assume that the progression of the illness is not severe, individuals recover. The duration ofhospitalization di ers according to the underlying virus. From the hospital, individuals either recover (R)or die (D). We assume that hospitalized individuals have 75% less contact with susceptible individuals,which results in 75% reduced transmission during hospitalization. We further assume that recoveredindividuals (R) gain full immunity to the virus causing the illness.Model assumptions include:(1) From the initially infectious state, individuals progress to hospital or continued non-hospitalizedinfectious state.(2) From the non-hospitalized infectious state, individuals progress to recovery.(3) From the hospitalized state, individuals progress to death or recovery.(4) Everyone who recovers gains full immunity.(5) Total infected population = E + I1 + I2 + H.(6) Total infectious population = I1 + I2 + H.(7) The viruses operate independently.(8) The population is homogeneously mixed.(9) No demographics are included.(10) The transmission rate for each virus is calculated from the expression for R0 below, using the meanreduction of transmission in hospitalper capita rate of progress from exposed to infectious stateper capita rate of progress through initial infectious stateper capita rate of progress through hospitalized stateper capita rate of progress through non-hospitalized infectiousstateproportion of initially infectious population that becomeshospitalized.proportion of hospitalized population that dieWe assume that the stable population, representing a hypothetical small city, is N = 10000. We furtherassume that the initial value for the Susceptible population is S0 = 10000. In the disease-free state, allinfected classes are zero,that is, E = I1 = I2 = H = 0. Substituting and setting the derivatives equalto zero, it is evident that in the disease-free state, the other state variables R and D will continue tocontain zero individuals, and that the Susceptible class S will remain equal to the total population N, asfollows.Additionally, if we set any one of E, I1, I2, or H to zero, the other three state variables representinginfected classes must also be zero. In this case, N=S=10000. Thus, where x = (S; E; I1; I2; H; R; D)denotes solutions of the system, xdfe = (10000; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0) represents the disease-free equilibrium forthe system.(3)BBBBV = BBBB 0BB@011022(1p1)2p1FVBBBB1 = BB0SHc3The spectral radius, or the largest positive eigenvalue of the next generation matrix, is the basicreproductive number of the system at the disease-free equilibrium, as follows.R0 =S(cp1 2 4p1 2 3 + 2 3 + 3 4); c; p1; 2; 3 and        There are several limitations to this study. First, the model is not age-structured. Second, theassumption that the latent period equals the incubation period may result in an overestimation of the latentperiod. This is because the beginning of the true infectious period may occur before the onset ofsymptoms; however, this is di cult to measure and is not generally reported in the studies that report valuesfor the incubation period. Third, a single mortality rate has been modeled for the hospitalized infectedand non-hospitalized infected classes. Fourth, many of the studies that generated parameter valuesevaluated populations treated at clinics or admitted at hospitals. However, a signi cant proportion of illnessand death may occur outside of hospitals and clinics        Research support provided by the U.S. Department of Energy through the Los Alamos NationalLaboratory.

Coinfection was not taken into account in these estimates.2.2In view of the current outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, and given the need for plausibleparameters for modeling e orts, we conducted an in-depth literature review for human coronavirus.2019-nCoV has been identi ed as a member of genus betacoronavirus, along with SARS and MERS(WHO 2020). Means have been collected when possible; when not available, medians have beenrecorded. Information on the studies, the strains, the sample sizes, and the references is availableon pages 26-27 of this paper. Individ-ualsare considered susceptible until they contact an infectious individual from (I1), (I2), or (H). Given contactwith an infectious individual, transmission takes place with some probability. After the latent period, they move to the rst infectiousclass (I1). The mean duration of the rst infectious period di ers according to the underlying virus. We assume that hospitalized individuals have 75% less contact with susceptible individuals,which results in 75% reduced transmission during hospitalization. Additionally, if we set any one of E, I1, I2, or H to zero, the other three state variables representinginfected classes must also be zero.

This is because the beginning of the true infectious period may occur before the onset ofsymptoms; however, this is di cult to measure and is not generally reported in the studies that report valuesfor the incubation period.
