The present findings are expected to be helpful for the diseaseprevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.1        Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses that can causerespiratory, intestinal and central nervous system infections in humans and animals [                Before efficient antiviral drugs or vaccines are developed for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, anotheroutbreak of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan sinceDecember 2019. As of February 17, 2020, 2019-nCoV has caused more than 70000 cases in Chinaand nearly 8000 cases around the world with about 1700 related deaths [10\u201314]. The full-lengthgenome sequence of 2019-nCoV was soon determined by the Zhang group [                Coronaviruses uses the surface spike (S) glycoprotein on the envelope to attach host cells andmediate host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection [                Although it seems clear that 2019-nCoV infects human cells through the binding of the RBDdomain to the human ACE2 receptor [        6ACD) [21]. For 2019-nCoV, the three dimensional (3D) RBD structure was modeled based on theRBD structure of SARS-CoV using the MODELLER program [24], where the sequence alignmentwas performed using the ClustalW program [25, 26]. The complex structure between the 2019-nCoVRBD protein and human ACE2 was then predicted by our protein-protein docking approach [28\u201330].The 3D structure of the trimeric spike protein for 2019-nCoV was constructed based on the structureof the SARS-CoV spike protein using MODELLER.2.2The complex structure between the 2019-nCoV RBD protein and the human ACE2 molecule waspredicted using our hybrid protein-protein docking algorithm, HDOCK [27\u201330]. Specifically, giventhe individual structures of the spike RBD protein and the human ACE2 molecule, HDOCK willglobally sample all possible binding modes between the two proteins through a fast Fourier transform(FFT) search strategy [30]. Then, all the sampled binding modes were evaluated by our iterativeknowledge-based scoring function [31]. Last, the binding modes were ranked according to theirbinding energy scores, and the top ten binding modes were provided to users. During the dockingcalculation, all the default parameters were used. Namely, the grid spacing was set to 1.2 A\u02da for 3D\u25e6translational search, the angle interval was set to 15 for rotational sampling in 3D Euler space, thebinding interface information in the PDB was automatically applied during the modeling of individualstructures. A web server version of our HDOCK algorithm can be freely accessed from our web siteat http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/ [29].2.3          The AMBER suite was used for the MD simulations [          3.1The RBD proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV exhibit a high sequence similarity (89.2%) witha sequence identity of 73.7%. The high homology resulted in an accurate 3D RBD model of2019nCoV with a small RMSD of 0.55 A\u02da from the experimental SARS-CoV RBD structure. With theexperimental human ACE2 structure and the 2019-nCoV RBD model, we then performedproteinprotein docking to predict their binding mode using our HDOCK approach [28\u201330]. Figure 1A showsthe predicted complex structure between the human ACE2 molecule and the 2019-nCoV RBD protein.It can be seen from the figure that the predicted RBD-ACE2 complex structure for 2019-nCoV isvery close to the experimentally determined RBD-ACE2 complex structure for SARS-CoV, and theinterface root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) between the two complexes is 0.473 A\u02da, showing thatthe RBDs of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV bind to the same site of the human ACE2 receptor (Figure1A). These results can also be understood by comparing the residues at the RBD-ACE2 bindinginterface for 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. The binding sites on the RBD proteins of 2019-nCoV andSARS-CoV are very conserved and the corresponding residues show a high sequence similarity of83.3% (Figures 1B and C). Among them, those hydrophobic residues that are important forproteinprotein interactions are especially conserved. For the RBD of 2019-nCoV, there are 13 hydrophobicresidues at the binding site, which are comparable to 13 hydrophobic residues for that of SARS-CoV(Figure 1B).3.2          We have run a long-time MD simulation to generate the trajectories of the RBD-ACE2 complexsystem for 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. The binding free energies were calculated using the MM-GBSAmodel by the \u201cMMPBSA.py\u201d script in the AMBER package. Table 1 shows a comparison of theRBDACE2 binding free energies for 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. It can be seen from the table that thebinding free energy of the RBD-ACE2 interaction for 2019-nCoV is \u221250.43 kcal/mol, which issignificantly lower than the binding free energy of the RBD-ACE2 interaction for SARS-CoV (\u221236.75kcal/mol). In other words, 2019-nCoV binds human ACE2 with a significantly higher affinity thanSARS-CoV. This result is consistent with the current fact that 2019-CoV is much more infectious thanSARS-CoV. Very recently, experimental studies also showed that 2019-CoV could bind human ACE2with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV [          The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is a trimeric protein. This protein is critical for thevitality of coronaviruses because it is not only an important component for the virus particle but alsoplays a crucial role in attaching host cells and fusing the membranes [21]. In addition, the spikeprotein also determines the solubility of coronavirus particles and thus the viral infectivity becausethe spike protein is the largest protein located on the membrane surface. Therefore, the spike proteinis directly related to the stability and functionality of coronaviuses. Here, we have run a lengthy MDsimulation to study the trimeric spike proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.Table 2 gives a comparison between the free energies of the spike proteins for 2019-nCoV andSARS-CoV. It can be seen from the table that the spike protein of 2019-nCoV has a significantlylower total free energy (Gtotal = \u221267303.28 kcal/mol) than the spike protein of SARS-CoV (Gtotal =\u221263139.96 kcal/mol) (Table 2). These results suggest that 2019-nCoV is more stable and can survivea significantly higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also partly explain the higher infectivityof 2019-nCoV than SARS-CoV because 2019-nCoV would have a higher virus vitality thanSARSCoV in the same temperature.          The lower free energy of the 2019-nCoV spike protein may result from the virus evolution ofSARS-CoV because SARS-like coronaviruses normally originate from bats that are known to havea higher body temperature than humans. In other words, 2019-nCoV and other SARS-likecoronavirus would have evolved to achieve a lower free energy for their spike proteins by recombinationor mutations so that they can survive in high-temperature animals like bats [          CoV3.4Coronaviruses uses the spike protein to attach host cells by binding the host cell receptor. Therefore,the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is critical for coronaviruses to infect host cells.Here, we have run lengthy MD simulations to investigate the structural properties of the RBD proteinsfor 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Table 3 shows a comparison between the free energies of the RBDproteins for 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Similar to the findings in the spike protein as detailed in thelast section (Table 2), the RBD protein of 2019-nCoV also shows a significantly lower free energythan that of SARS-CoV (-4090.04 vs. -3617.73 kcal/mol) (Table 3), which may also be understoodby the evolution pressure from the high-temperature host environment. However, unlike in the spikeprotein where the free energy difference between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV is mostly attributedthe inter-residue interactions in vacuum (Ggas), here in the RBD protein, the free energy differencebetween 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV comes from both the free energy in vacuum Ggas (-2104.37 vs.-1703.66 kcal/mol) and solvation energy Gsolv (-1985.68 vs. -1914.07 kcal/mol) (Table 3). The lowersolvation energy of 2019-nCoV than SARS-CoV in the RBD may be understood because the RBDmust move up away from the spike protein and into the water in order to bind human ACE2 [20].In other words, 2019-nCoV would have evolved to be more soluble so that it can move up and bindthe ACE2 more easily. The better solubility of the RBD of 2019-nCoV than SARS-CoV may alsocontribute to part of the higher infectivity of 2019-nCoV than SARS-CoV.Protein flexibility is a critical factor in binding as it may not only change the binding interfacebetween two proteins but also be an important contribution to the entropy penalty upon binding.Therefore, we have investigated the protein flexibility of the RBD domains for 2019-nCoV andSARSCoV by analyzing their coordinate trajectories. Figure 2 show two ensembles of selected trajectoriesover a period of 10ns simulations for the RBD domains of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. The figurealso gives a comparison of the root mean square fluctuations (RMSF), a rough measurement of proteinflexibility, for 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. It can be seen from the figure that the RBD of2019nCoV shows a significantly higher RMSF than that of SARS-CoV. In other words, the RBD of2019nCoV is much more flexible than the RBD of 2019-nCoV. The flexibility is especially higher near thebinding site than other regions (Figure 2A). That means that 2019-nCoV must overcome much moreentropy penalty than SARS-CoV when binding to human ACE2. As we know, the binding free energybetween two proteins can be expressed as, \u0394G = \u0394E \u2212 T \u0394S, where \u0394E is the interaction energy,\u0394S is the entropy, and T is the temperature of the system. As \u0394S is negative, the binding free energywill become higher and the binding will become weaker with the increasing temperature. Therefore,the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity for 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease much faster than that forSARS-CoV when the temperature increases. In other words, 2019-nCoV is much moretemperaturesensitive than SARS-CoV. Namely, 2019-nCoV will decrease its infection ability much faster thanSARS-CoV when the temperature rises. Therefore, it is expected that 2019-nCoV will become lessinfectious compared to SARS-CoV, and the disease prevention and control for 2019-nCoV will geteasier when the weather gets warmer/hotter, although the drug and vaccine development targeting theRBD protein will be more challenging because of the protein flexibility at the binding site.4In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBDprotein systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV through protein-protein docking and MD simulations. Itwas found that 2019-nCoV has a higher binding affinity with human ACE2 than SARS-CoV,explaining the fact that 2019-CoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. The spike protein of 2019-nCoValso shows a lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stableand may be able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also explain the batorigin of 2019-nCoV, as bats have a higher body-temperature than humans. In addition, the RBDof 2019-nCoV exhibits a significantly higher flexibility than that of SARS-CoV, especially near thebinding site. That indicates that 2019-nCoV must overcome a higher entropy penalty in order to bindACE2 and is thus more temperature-sensitive than SARS-CoV. Therefore, with the rising temperature,2019-nCoV is expected to decrease the infection ability much faster and become much less infectiousthan SARS-CoV, which would make the disease prevention and control of 2019-nCoV easier. Takingthe above results together, unlike SARS-CoV that is gone after 2003, 2019-nCoV might survive thehigh-temperature environment like Summer in which the virus is not active/infectious due to the highflexibility in the RBD, and then become infectious when the temperature is low in the Winter. Thesefindings will have a far-reaching implication for disease prevention and control as well as drug andvaccine development for 2019-nCoV.This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant Nos. 31670724)and the startup grant of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.Conflict of interest statement.

Similar to the findings in the spike protein as detailed in thelast section (Table 2), the RBD protein of 2019-nCoV also shows a significantly lower free energythan that of SARS-CoV (-4090.04 vs. -3617.73 kcal/mol) (Table 3), which may also be understoodby the evolution pressure from the high-temperature host environment. As we know, the binding free energybetween two proteins can be expressed as, \u0394G = \u0394E \u2212 T \u0394S, where \u0394E is the interaction energy,\u0394S is the entropy, and T is the temperature of the system. In other words, 2019-nCoV is much moretemperaturesensitive than SARS-CoV. Namely, 2019-nCoV will decrease its infection ability much faster thanSARS-CoV when the temperature rises. In addition, the RBDof 2019-nCoV exhibits a significantly higher flexibility than that of SARS-CoV, especially near thebinding site. 31670724)and the startup grant of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
