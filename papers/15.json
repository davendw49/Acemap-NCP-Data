Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability ofspecific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. Inthe present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome toidentify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cellepitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potentialimmunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showedaffinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity,human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptidescontained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA allelesaccounting for ~99% of Chinese population. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds ofepitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. In conclusion, these putative antigenic peptidesmay elicit the resistance response to the viral infection. In vitro and in vivo experiments arerequired to validate the effectiveness of these peptide vaccine.Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, epitope, immunoinformatics, vaccine383940414243444546474849505152535455565758        Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China has become the center of an outbreakof viral lung infections caused by a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2        Currently, there is no approved therapeutics or vaccines available for the treatment ofCOVID19 (Chen et al.). Due to lack of anti-viral drugs or vaccines, control measures have beenrelying on the rapid detection and isolation of symptomatic cases (Chen et al.). In this context, asafe and efficacious vaccine is urgently required. Traditional approaches for developing vaccineswaste much time in isolating, inactivating and injecting the microorganisms (or portions of them)that cause disease. Fortunately, computation-based method enable us to start from analysis of viralgenome, without the need to grow pathogens and therefore speeding up the entire process.Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has finished and paved the way for the vaccinedevelopment (Chen et al.). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes the spike protein, the membraneprotein, the envelope protein, the nucleocapsid protein and a few replication and606162636465666768697071727374757677787980transcription-related enzymes. Given the lack of repairing mechanism of RNA virus replicasecomplex, mutations are prone to occur during virus replication. The 4% nucleotide difference ofthe virus isolated from Rhinolophus to that from human suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutatesrapidly to achieve the host conversion (Jiayuan Chen, 2020). Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 usesits receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein to bind to the host\u2019sangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Chen et al.; Dong et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Zhouet al., 2020). In terms of binding capacity, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is much stronger thanSARS-CoV and is considered to be between HKU3-4 which cannot bind to ACE2 receptor andrSHC014 which presents the largest binding energy (Gralinski and Menachery, 2020; Wrapp et al.,2020; Zhao et al., 2020). Consequently, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can be developed targeting thestructural proteins, and in particular, the RBD region, following the strategy for the SARS-CoVvaccine development (Babcock et al., 2004; Buchholz et al., 2004; He et al., 2005; Saif, 1993;Tian et al., 2020).An ideal vaccine may contain both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes, with combination ofwhich vaccine is able to either induce specific humoral or cellular immune against pathogensefficiently (Purcell et al., 2007). Since the development of a peptide vaccine against the viruscausing foot-and-mouth disease (Adam et al., 1978), the establishment of peptide synthesismethod by Lerner et al. (Lerner et al., 1981), along with the advent of a peptide vaccine designcombining T-cell and B-cell epitopes, has accelerated the vaccine development. In the presentstudy, we followed this in silico approach to identify the potential B-cell and T-cell epitope(s)from the spike, envelope and membrane proteins that could be used as promising vaccines againstSARS-CoV-2.The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was retrieved from the NCBIdatabase under the accession number MN908947. Gene and protein sequences were acquiredaccording to the annotation. In particular, the RBD region for the spike protein was referred to asthe fragment from 347 to 520 amino acid (aa) (Lu et al., 2020).The online tool in IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource) was used for theanalysis of the conserved regions of the candidate epitopes (Vita et al., 2015). Prediction of linearB-cell epitopes was performed through Bepipred software (Jespersen et al., 2017). The antigenicsites were determined with Kolaskar method (Chen et al., 2007). The surface accessible epitopeswere predicted by Emini tool (Almofti et al., 2018).The sequences of structural proteins were split into small fragments with a length of 9aa; theirbinding affinity with the 34 most prevalent HLA alleles (>1% in the Chinese population accordingto data obtained from the website for China Marrow Donor Program (CMDP)) was predictedusing netMHCpan (Hoof et al., 2009) and our in-house prediction software iNeo-Pred,respectively. iNeo-Pred was trained on a large immune-peptide dataset, and achieved a betterperformance in predicting binding affinity of epitopes to specific HLA alleles. Only the epitopes102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121predicted by both tools were selected. Next, for each epitope, a HLA score was calculated basedon the frequencies of binding HLA alleles in Chinese population, which will be used as metrics toselect better candidates for downstream analysis.The vaccine peptides were designed by our in-house tool iNeo-Design. First, the selected B-cellepitopes and their adjacent T-cell epitopes were bridged to form candidate peptides with length nomore than 30aa. Meanwhile, to facilitate the peptide synthesis, vaccine peptide sequences wereoptimized based on their hydrophobicity and acidity. To minimize the safety risk, peptides thatcontained toxicity potential, human homologous region (full-length matches and identity > 95%),or bioactive peptide were discarded.Besides the vaccine peptides containing both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes,iNeo-Design also utilized all predicted T-cell epitopes to generate T-cell epitopes-only vaccinepeptides. For each vaccine candidate, the epitope counts and HLA score reflecting the populationcoverage were calculated. Vaccine candidates with the higher epitope counts and HLA score wereconsidered to be preferable for the downstream analysis.The online server swiss-model was used to predict the 3D protein structures of viral proteins andHLA molecules (Waterhouse et al., 2018). The online server PEP_FOLD was used to predictT-cell epitopes\u2019 structures (Lamiable et al., 2016). To display the interaction between T-cellepitopes and HLA molecules, T-cell epitope models were docked to HLA molecules usingMDockPep (Xu et al., 2018). All predicted structures or models were decorated and displayed by123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141the open source version of pymol program (https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source).During the immune response against viral infection, B-cell takes in viral epitopes to recognizeviruses and activates defense responses. Recognition of B-cell epitopes depends on antigenicity,accessibility of surface and predictions of linear epitope (Fieser et al., 1987). A total of 61 B-cellepitopes were predicted, which seemed preferentially located within certain regions of each gene(Figure 1; Figure 2; Table S1). Only 19 epitopes were exposed on the surface of the virion and hada high antigenicity score, indicating their potentials in initiating immune response. Therefore, theywere considered to be promising vaccine candidates against B-cells. Among the 19 epitopes, 17were longer than 14 residues and located in the spike protein that contained RBD and functionedin host cell binding (Table 1). The average Emini score for the 19 epitopes was 2.744, and theaverage for Kolaskar (antigenicity) score was 1.015. Two epitopes were located within the RBDregion, while the one with the highest Kolaskar score (1.059), 1052-FPQSAPH-1058, was locatedat position 1052aa of the spike protein.143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162The immune response of T-cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B-cell wherethe antigen might easily escape the antibody memory response (Black et al., 2010). Moreover, theCD8+ T and CD4+ T-cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity. It is thereforeimportant to design vaccines that can induce T-cell's immune response (Sesardic, 1993). A total of499 T-cell epitopes were predicted on the spike protein (378 epitopes), the membrane protein (90epitopes) and the envelop protein (31 epitopes); 48 of the 378 epitopes for the spike protein werelocated in the RBD region (Figure 1; Table 2; Table S2). There is no preference in certain genes orregions for T-cell epitope generation; no biased distribution of T-cell epitopes among HLA typeswere observed either. Among all T-cell epitopes, the epitope 869-MIAQYTSAL-877 in the spikeprotein was predicted to be able to bind to 17 HLA alleles. Most of the HLA alleles included in thepresent study were covered by these vaccine candidates, which suggested a wide populationcoverage.In terms of the distribution of the predicted epitopes against different HLA haplotypes, nosignificant differences were observed among different HLA haplotypes (Table S3). There were287, 208 and 195 epitopes predicted to be able to bind to HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C haplotypes,respectively. For the most popular five HLA types (HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-C*07:02,HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*46:01), the counts for epitopes with binding affinity were 51, 49, 115,48 and 58.Based on the 19 B-cell epitopes and their 121 adjacent T-cell epitopes, 17 candidate vaccine164165166167168169170171172173174175176177178179180181182183peptides that contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes were generated by our in-house softwareiNeo-Design. Most of the 17 candidate vaccine peptides contained one B-cell epitopes, except forAVEQDKNTQEVFAQVKQIYKTPPIKDFGG, which involved two B-cell epitopes and eightT-cell epitopes, and AKNLNESLIDLQELGKYEQYIKWPWYIWKK, which contained twoB-cellepitopesand6T-cellepitopes.Bycomparison,thevaccinepeptideFKNLREFVFKNIDGYFKIYSKHTPINLV had the largest count of T-cell epitopes, whereas thevaccine peptide SYGFQPTNGVGYQPYRVVVLSFELLHAPAT showed the highest HLA score,indicating their wide population coverage and promising efficacy.In addition to the vaccine candidates involved both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, we alsoanalysed the entire 499 core T-cell epitopes to generate another 102 vaccine peptides containingT-cell epitopes only. Based on both the epitope counts and HLA score, we eventually selected 13T-cell epitopes-only vaccine peptides.Taken together, a total of 30 peptide vaccine candidates were designed (Table 3). 26 of themwere from the spike protein, two from the membrane protein and two from the envelop protein.Five peptides were located in the RBD region, indicating they were likely to induce the productionof neutralizing antibody. The 30 vaccine peptides covered all structural proteins that may induceimmune response against SARS-CoV-2 in theory; and the multi-peptide strategy we applied wouldbetter fit the genetic variability of the human immune system and reduce the risk of pathogen\u2019sescape through mutation (Skwarczynski and Toth, 2016).To further inspect the binding stability of T-cell epitopes against HLA alleles, the T-cell epitopes185186187188189190191192193194195196197198199200201202203204involved in the above designed vaccine peptides were selected to conduct an interaction analysis.from vaccines peptide 25 and 27 (Table 3; Table 4), which showed relatively higher HLA score.The MDockPep scores were between -148 ~ -136, indicating that the predicted crystal structureswere stable. All epitopes were docked inside the catalytic pocket of the receptor protein. Inparticular, the epitope 1220-FIAGLIAIV-1228 from the spike protein possessed 2-5 stablehydrogen bonds with the HLA alleles; the epitope 4-FVSEETGTL-12 from the envelop proteinpossessed 4~5 stable hydrogen bonds (Table 4). Taken together, the epitopes included in ourvaccine peptides can interact with the given HLA alleles by in silico prediction.Vaccine design using an in silico prediction method is highly appreciated as it selects specificepitopes in proteins than conventional methods. In the present study, this reverse vaccinologyapproach was adopted to identify surface-exposed peptides, instead of targeting the wholepathogen which is obviously less efficient and effective. Immunogenic regions of antigenicepitopes of all proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 were screened to identify potential vaccinecandidates. As a result, 17 vaccine peptides involving both T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes aswell as 13 vaccine peptides involving T-cell epitopes only were successfully designed. Thesemulti-epitope vaccines provided excellent candidates for the development of vaccines againstSARS-CoV-2. Various formulation of vaccine can be rapidly manufactured, such as peptide, DNAand mRNA. However in vitro and in vivo trials are required to achieve the effectiveness of these206vaccine peptides.This work was supported by Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China.the data.

First, the selected B-cellepitopes and their adjacent T-cell epitopes were bridged to form candidate peptides with length nomore than 30aa. Meanwhile, to facilitate the peptide synthesis, vaccine peptide sequences wereoptimized based on their hydrophobicity and acidity. All predicted structures or models were decorated and displayed by123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141the open source version of pymol program (https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source).During the immune response against viral infection, B-cell takes in viral epitopes to recognizeviruses and activates defense responses. Moreover, theCD8+ T and CD4+ T-cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity. There is no preference in certain genes orregions for T-cell epitope generation; no biased distribution of T-cell epitopes among HLA typeswere observed either. Taken together, a total of 30 peptide vaccine candidates were designed (Table 3). Vaccine design using an in silico prediction method is highly appreciated as it selects specificepitopes in proteins than conventional methods.
