The last case of SARS-CoV occurred inSeptember 2003, after having infected over 8,000 personsand causing 774 deaths with a case fatality rate calculatedat\u00a09.5%.Nine years later, a new coronavirus that causesrespiratory disease appeared in the Middle East, thus thename of MERS-CoV. Symptoms of MERS-CoV arenonspecific, but many patients end up with severe acuterespiratory distress. In these patients, travel history isimperative, as all cases have been linked to persons in or nearthe Arabian Peninsula. Similar to SARS-CoV, healthprofessionals are at higher risk of acquiring the disease, asdemonstrated in the outbreak in South Korea.3 However,in comparison with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is stillcirculating, and the case fatality rate is much higher (around35%). What has allowed control of MERS-CoV is a lowR0 (approximately 1), meaning each person with thedisease transmits it to only one other person (theSARSCoV R was of approximately\u00a04).0In December 30, 2019, a cluster of patients withpneumonia of unknown etiology was observed in Wuhan, China,and reported to the World Health Organization (WHO)China bureau in Beijing. A\u00a0 week later, January 7, 2020, anew coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated from thesepatients. This virus was initially referred to as novelcoronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) but was given the official name ofCOVID-19 by the WHO on February 11, 2020. This newvirus has infected more people than either of its twopredecessors. Several factors have allowed the rapid spread of thisvirus: Wuhan is the capital of China\u2019s Hubei province, withover 11,000,000 inhabitants, and it is a major transportationhub, which increases person-to-person contact and adds tothe possibility of exporting cases to other locations. At thispoint, the R is calculated between 2 and 3.5, indicating that0one patient can transmit the disease to two to three otherpeople. Patients with the COVID-19 infection proven bypolymerase chain reaction have been an average age of 55\u00a0years(cases in children seem to be rare).4 They present with fever,dry cough, and shortness of breath and, in the most severecases, have pneumonia. The case fatality rate is around 2%\u275aImage 1\u275a Electron microscopy photograph of negativestain of a coronavirus (image from the Public Health ImageLibrary).to 3%. SARS-CoV-2 will cause many more deaths than itspredecessors, even though the mortality rate is lower thanMERS-CoV infections, because there have been so manymore cases. Chinese authorities have taken the global threatvery seriously, and the containment measures have beenunprecedented (closing airports, train stations, and roads toWuhan; building hospitals in record time). However, caseswith SARS-CoV-2 are already being reported in manycountries, including the United States.The question of how to approach these patientsfor diagnosis and treatment is pressing. For patients inthe United States, the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (CDC) is continuously updating informationand has instructions on who to test and the workflow tofollow regarding specimen handling.5 In brief, testing forSARS-CoV-2 needs to be sent to the state laboratory afterconsultation with it regarding patient clinicalcharacteristics, the specimens it will receive, and packaging of thesample using shipping regulations for category B agents.Other tests, such as CBC count, chemistries, andmicrobiology (including molecular testing for other respiratoryviruses), can be handled using universal precautions (faceprotection, gloves, and disposable gowns) in hospitallaboratories, so as not to delay other necessary treatment.It should be noted that although some multiplexmolecular panels include primers for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV,and other coronaviruses responsible for upper respiratoryinfections (HcoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), theydo not detect COVID-19. The CDC is advising not toperform viral cultures in patients under investigation for\u00a9 American Society for Clinical Pathologyeither MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. The WHO also hasa webpage with guidance regarding multiple aspects,including surveillance, patient management, and laboratorytesting specific for SARS-CoV-2.6 Once a patient has beendefined as infected with SARS-CoV-2, he or she shouldbe treated, taking into consideration airborne and contactprecautions. Most of the measures are symptomatic,although some antiviral medications have been\u00a0used.Last, at this point, reports of autopsies or lung tissuesamples of patients with SARS-CoV-2 have not beenpublished. However, based on imaging studies and whatwe know of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, patients withthe most severe disease will likely show diffuse alveolardamage with hyaline membrane formation, inflammationin the alveolar walls, desquamation of pneumocytes, and,if the case is complicated by a secondary bacterialpneumonia, intra-alveolar inflammatory infiltrate byneutrophils. Any other specific features, such as multinucleatedcells or potential viral inclusions, remain to be discoveredthrough pathologic studies of patients with this new\u00a0virus.In summary, the story of SARS-CoV-2 continues toevolve. Because SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have haddifferent behaviors, SARS-CoV-2 will likely have uniquefeatures of its own that we will learn as the outbreak progresses.", "ref_list": [[], ["A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome"], ["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
