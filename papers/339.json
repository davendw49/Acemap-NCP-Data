As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for health-care capacity planning.", "text": "        An outbreak of a novel coronavirus, recently renamed CoVID-19, was first reported fromWuhan, China on 31 December 2019. During January 2020, the outbreak spread to multiplecities in China, and the first cases started appearing outside China. By the end of January 2020,9,720 cases had been confirmed in China, with 106 confirmed cases outside China across 19different countries(                Epidemiological analysis of the outbreak was quickly used to start estimatingepidemiologicallyrelevant parameters, such as the basic reproduction number, the serial interval, the incubationperiod and the case fatality rate(                Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the possible course of anoutbreak, given a set of underlying assumptions. Here, we adapt a metapopulation model ofdisease transmission in England and Wales to capture the spread of CoVID-19(                  We use an existing national-scale stochastic metapopulation model of disease transmission inEngland and Wales. The model structure is based on the metapopulation model described indetail in Danon et al (2009)(                    Transmission between wards occurs via the daily movement of individuals. For each ward, weassume that individuals contribute to the force of infection in their \u201chome\u201d ward during the nightand their \u201cwork\u201d ward during the day. See Danon et al 2009 for further details(          Data for population and movement of individuals come from the 2011 census of the UnitedKingdom. The population size of each of the 8,570 electoral wards is available directly from theOffice of National Statistics (ONS) website. The number of individuals moving between locationsis also available from the ONS website, but at the level of census output areas (OAs). Weaggregated the data from OA level to electoral wards level. Spatial location of electoral wardcentres are extracted from maps available from the ONS websites.          We use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Infectious-Recovered (SEIIR) model within eachward to capture the progression of disease within an individual (figure 1). Initial analyses usedSARS-like parameters for the incubation period and infectious period, which now appear todiffer from CoVID-19(          The census data are used to initialise the population sizes within each of the 8,570 wards. Atthe start of the model, all individuals are assumed to be susceptible to infection with nounderlying immunity in the population. We investigated a range of starting scenarios by seedingthe infection in example wards London, Birmingham, Brighton, Sheffield and Cardiff. To seedinfection in a ward, we move five individuals (non-commuters) from the susceptiblecompartment to the first infectious state.We investigated the impact of a seasonally affected transmission rate, to capture potentialdecreased transmission during the summer months. We captured seasonal transmission byreplacing the constant transmission rate with a time-varying transmission rate given by:121 cos2365Where is the magnitude of the seasonal difference in transmission, ranging from 0 (noseasonality) to 1 (maximum seasonality with no transmission at the peak of the summer).From the model, we extracted the total number of infections per day, as the number ofindividuals in both of the Infectious states, and the number of infected wards per day as the totalnumber of wards with at least one individual in one of the two Infectious states. The spatialgrowth of the epidemic in England and Wales was visualised using interactive maps. Weestimated the timing of the epidemic peak from the aggregated epidemic curve and calculated95% prediction intervals from the model simulations.The model is coded in C and is available on github (http://github.com/ldanon/MetaWards). Thedata are freely available from the Office for National Statistics website, or can be downloadedwith the code at the github repository.We predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with \u201cbest-guess\u201d CoVID-19-likeparameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 - 147 days) following the start ofpersonto-person transmission in England and Wales. Intrinsic model stochasticity is responsible forvariation between model runs. Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection inthe same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/- 10 days (figure 2). The attackrate for best-guess parameters had a median of 45799874 (81.67% range 81.64-81.69), with apeak incidence median 1,116,692.The initial location of cases had some, but limited impact on the timing of the epidemic inEngland and Wales. Epidemics seeded in Brighton, London, Birmingham and Sheffield resultedin synchronised epidemics in England, reaching urban areas first followed by rural areas.Epidemics started in Cardiff had a slower time to peak but still resulted in a generalisedoutbreak.Spatially, some disaggregation between England and Wales regions is observed. An outbreakstarting in Brighton, (South East England) peaks in London and the South East first, and NorthEast England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales last, with a ten-day lag between regions(Figure 3).Model predictions are highly sensitive to parameter values and incorporating parameteruncertainty increases the variability of model predictions. In the absence of any controlmeasures, all predictions resulted in epidemics that peaked within a year from the start ofperson-to-person transmission in England and Wales. Estimates of peak time ranged from 78days to 241 days (Figure 4).However, seasonality in transmission has a large impact on epidemic timing, peak incidence,and final attack rates. Assuming no difference in transmission rate during the year leads to asingle large epidemic after approximately 4 months (June time if transmission starts inFebruary), as above. With a 25% reduction in transmission the epidemic is smaller and peakslater, reducing the overall attack rate by 20%. A 50% reduction in transmission results in asmaller epidemic before the summer, followed by a resurgence in cases in the following winter.The attack rate is 10% less than a non-seasonal epidemic. A 75% reduction in transmissionover the summer resulted in a delayed large outbreak, but with a similar attack rate. Iftransmission decreases to zero over the summer then the resulting outbreak is much reduced,with an attack rate of less than 1% (Figure 5, Table 2).        We predict that, in the absence of control measures and with no seasonality in transmission, theintroduction of CoVID-19 in England and Wales has the potential to result in a synchronisedoutbreak that peaks at around 4 months following the start of person-to-person transmission.Our findings suggest that the height of the epidemic and the attack rate is highly dependent onseasonality of transmission and that even small changes in transmission risk can lead to largechanges in attack rate due to the spatial disaggregation of the population at risk.A combination of control measures and seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift thepeak of the outbreak to the winter of 2020/21, with little effect on the final attack rate. If contacttracing and isolation efforts succeed in reducing transmission, but are unable to control theepidemic (                The strength of this model lies in the spatial heterogeneity which tempers transmission. As acomparison, an equivalent non-spatial model results in the epidemic peaking after 34 days,nearly four times faster than this spatial model, and would be unable to capture the interactionbetween spatial transmission and seasonality. The estimated total number of people infected inthe spatial model is marginally smaller than for a non-spatial model, as the infection has theopportunity to die-out in local parts of the country. As the model framework was developed andpublished in 2009, it was possible to re-deploy the model for these new circumstances;developing such a model from scratch during an outbreak would be a significant challenge.A key element missing from our model is morbidity, mortality and the treatment of cases. Themodel in its current form predicts the total number of infections in the community rather thandiagnosed cases. Observations from China suggest that many cases have mild symptoms andthat only around 5% of cases have been reported and diagnosed (        As with all modelling, it is impossible to capture the full complexity of an epidemic. In this model,the major assumptions are that we have assumed that there is no change in behaviour duringthe course of the epidemic. In practice, as the epidemic starts spreading in England and Walesthere may well be a systematic change in behaviour as was seen during the H1N1 influenzapandemic in 2009. We have not included any age-effects, such as differential mixing,susceptibility or infectiousness. That means that we are not able to investigate the impact ofschool closures or the impact of the summer holidays, which had a large impact on the H1N1influenza pandemic in 2009.EBP was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit(NIHR HPRU) in Evaluation of Interventions at University of Bristol in partnership with PublicHealth England (PHE).
