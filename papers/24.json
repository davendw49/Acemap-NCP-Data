To reveal the evolutionmechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newlysequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotidemutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them causedamino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotidesubstitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 andBat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between othercoronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 andRaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotidesubstitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signaturecaused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similarbetween SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had smallimpact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoVRaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowestamong all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringentselective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection.Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viralpathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.        SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV, is a novel coronavirus (CoVs) isolated frompatients with pneumonia in China 2019. SARS-CoV-2 has a similar incubation period (median,3.0 days) and a relatively lower fatality rate than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (        The genetic information of a virus is essential for not only its classification and traceability,but also its pathogenicity. At the whole genome level, the sequence identify of SARS-CoV-2 was50% to MERS-CoV, 79% to SARS-CoV, 88% to two bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses,Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, China) , and 96% toBat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 (collected in 2013 in Yunnan, China) (5). Each genome of allSARS-CoV-2 strains now submitted online contains nearly 29,900 nucleotides (nt), which arepredicted with at least 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (5\u2032 to 3\u2032), such as ORF1ab (P, 21,291 nt),spike (S, 3,822 nt), ORF3a (8,28 nt), envelope (E, 228 nt), membrane (M, 669nt), ORF8 (366 nt),and nucleocapsid (N,1,260 nt) (6). Among them, the spike gene encoded a glycoprotein that iscrucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity, and highly divergent whencompared with that of bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 (93.1% nucleotide identity) (6, 7).Generally, the rates of nucleotide substitution of RNA viruses are faster than their hosts, andthis rapid evolution is mainly shaped by natural selection (mostly purifying selection) (8). Genemutations such as nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions have been frequently reportedwhen comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other viruses (5-7). In this work, we investigated the mutationpattern of SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive comparative genomic analysis of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution, relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and selective pressure inorder to explore their potential in evolution and function.The SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) and WIV04 (MN996528)was downloaded from the GenBank database. Other newly sequenced 2019-nCoV genomes weredownloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database(https://www.gisaid.org/). Twenty-one closely related coronavirus complete genome sequencesand their coding sequences (CDS) were downloaded from GenBank database (SupplementaryTable S1).Genome sequences were aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31 (9), followed by manualadjustment using BioEdit v7.2.5. Phylogenetic analyses of complete genome were performedusing maximum-likelihood method and general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitutionwith gamma-distributed rates among sites (GTR+G) in RAxML v8.1.21 (10). Support for theinferred relationships was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates and trees wererooted with the alpha-coronavirus lineage as an outgroup.The coding sequences were translated and aligned using the MEGA-X program (11), andthen codon-based sequence alignment was used for further analysis. Phylogenetic analyses ofcoding sequences were performed using MEGA-X software. The changes of amino acids ornucleotides for each CDS sequences were analyzed using in-house Perl script.The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), and the number ofnon-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN), for each coding region werecalculated using the Nei-Gojobori method (Jukes-Cantor) in PAML package (12).The adaptive evolution server (http://www.datamonkey.org/) was used to identify eventualsites of positive selection. For this purpose, the following test has been used: mixed-effects modelof evolution (MEME), which allows the distribution of dN/dS (\u03c9) to vary from site to site andfrom branch to branch at a site (13). This test allowed us to infer episodic and pervasive positiveselection at individual sites.To investigate the potential relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias of the spikeprotein from SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related coronaviruses, the coding sequence (CDS) ofspikeproteininthesecoronaviruseswerecalculatedwith1.4.4(http://codonw.sourceforge.net/). The RSCU of human genes was retrieved from the Codon UsageDatabase (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). The potential relationships among these sequenceswere calculated with a squared Euclidean distance (uhu). Besides RSCU, theeffective number of codons (ENc) was used as a simple metrics to verify codon bias and toexplore the source of virus.Statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical package (version 3.2.2). TheChi-squared test was used to compare any two data sets, and data were considered significantlydifferent if the two-tailed p value was less than 0.05.The newly identified SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04 genome sequence was closely related withBat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45, which was collected from host Rhinolophusaffinis (5). Compared with RaTG13 genome, many nucleotide substitutions are observed, butthere are only five small inserts and deletions (indels) mutations, and the largest insert segment inWIV04 genome was \" CGGCGGGCACGT \" sequence, which is located near the boundary of S1and S2 regions of spike protein. Interestingly, only synonymous mutation are observed near thisinsertion sequence (Fig. 1, panel C). Compared with Bat-SL-CoVZC45 genome, this insertsegment is detected as well, but non-synonymous mutations are also observed around it. Then, wefurther compared the proportion of synonymous mutations in spike gene between WIV04 andRaTG13 or Bat-SL-CoVZC45. The ratio of nucleotide substitutions (263 NT) to amino acidsubstitutions (29 AA) was 9.07 from WIV04 to RaTG13, which was significantly higher than theratio (3.91, 864/221) from WIV04 to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2). Moreover, we alsoobserved that the synonymous mutations increased in whole genome level between WIV04 andRaTG13 than that between WIV04 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45.Next, the detailed nucleotide changes of each comparison group were analyzed, and wefound that the T-to-C (T:C) transition mutation was enriched in the nucleotide substitutionsbetween WIV04 and RaTG13 (Fig. 1B). It\u2019s reported that the CoVs lacking a 3\u2019-to-5\u2019exoribonuclease (ExoN) accumulated 15 to 20 fold more A:G and U:C transition (14). What\u2019smore, the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment will also increase the U:C and A:Gtransitions. Consequently, this increased T:C mutation implies the ExoN of SARS-CoV-2 may bedeactivated compared with that of RaTG13.Furthermore, we checked whether the ratio of synonymous substitution to missensesubstitution is increased within SARS-CoV-2 strains. From December 2019 to February 2020, thegenome sequences of 108 strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been submitted to GISAID databaseworldwide. Compared with the standard SARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04, total 98 point mutationswere detected at 93 nucleotide sites of all SARS-CoV-2 strains with genome sequence availableon Feb. 25 2020 (Fig. 1A). However, only 58 of these nucleotide mutations caused changes inamino acids. Among them, 15 nucleotide substitutions at 14 sites caused changes in 7 amino acidsof the spike protein were observed. Consequently, the proportion of synonymous mutations (~40%)among all current reported SARS-CoV-2 strains is similar to that between WIV04 andBat-SL-CoVZC45 (39.1%), but is dramatically less than that between WIV04 and RaTG13(90.7%).According to random drift hypothesis (15) \uff0c these nucleotide mutations among differentSARS-CoV-2 strains now available are still determined by neutral evolution. In short, there has nopowerful factor to force SARS-CoV-2 to evolve in a certain direction by far. However, we shouldtake strict precautions against the strong factors that may cause directional variation ofSARS-CoV-2 both in natural environment and infection treatment.To investigate whether the mutation pattern between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is uniqueacross all coronavirus species, we further compared their alterations of nucleotides and aminoacids in comparison to other representative coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2and its 20 closely related coronaviruses formed four well supported clades (Fig. 2). The twoSARS-CoV-2 strain WIV04 (from Wuhan) and SNU01 (from Korea patient) were clustered withSARS-CoV-related strains to form clade 1, belonging to beta-coronavirus lineage B. TheMERS-CoV (EMC2012) from human, CAMEL-363 from camel and RSA2011 from bat formedclade 2, belonging to beta-coronavirus lineage C. The third beta-coronavirus lineage A was formedby the representive virus Bovine coronavirus (bCoV-ENT), Murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59),and human coronaviruswas constituted of four representivealpha-coronaviruses. Notably, the sequence identities between closed related representativeviruses, such as WIV04 and RaTG13, Tor2 and WIV1, SADS FarmA and HKU1 were nearly95%.Compared with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, there were 293 nucleotideswere altered while only29 amino acids were altered in SARS-CoV-2; their ratio was as high as 9.07. However, this ratiodetected in the comparisons of other human coronaviruses with their similar animal coronaviruseswas less than 5.0. For example, the ratio of human SARS-CoV Tor2 to bat SARS-like CoVsLYRa11 was 4.81; that ratio of human MERS-CoV EMC2012 to bat SARS-like CoVs RSA2011was 2.80; that ratio of human coronavirus 229E to bat coronavirus HKU2 was 4.55. These resultsindicate that the relative level of synonymous substitutions between human SARS-CoV-2 and itspossible animal origin (RaTG13) is much higher than that between other human coronaviruses andtheir potential animal sources.Different organisms, even different protein coding genes of the same species, have differentfrequency of codon usage (16). The RSCU bias will reveal the difference of the host source. Wecalculated the distance of RSCU between spike genes of 20 representative coronaviruses andSARS-COV-2. The codon usage difference (distance of RSCU) of between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was 1.17, which was the lowest except for SNU01 (another strainof SARS-CoV-2), indicating that their codon preference was almost the same; the second lowestcodon usage difference was 2.41 that was detected between SARS-CoV-2WIV04 andBat-SL-CoVZC45 (Fig. 2). The coronaviruses in same beta-CoV lineage B have a relatively closedistance, except that of CoV Zhejiang2013. The codon usage difference of spike gene betweenhuman coronavirus HKU1 and bovine bCoV-ENT sequence have the largest difference, with aratio of 41.41.Codon usage bias in a gene can be effectively measured by determining the effective numberof codons (ENc). Generally, the RNA viruses usually consist of high ENc values which help it inreplication and host adaption with preferred codons. The lower ENc values represent high codonbias with low numbers of synonymous codons used for the amino acids, and a gene with strongcodon usage bias may have an ENc value less than 35. The ENc values of WIV04 spike gene was44.38 (Fig. 2), which is similar with those of RaTG13 and other bat coronavirus in Beta-CoVslineage (B), indicating the high synonymous mutation was not determined by codon usage bias.To infer whether the retention of synonymous mutations is supported or hindered by naturalselection, we further studied non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) and synonymous substitutionrate (dS) in spike gene (Table 1). Generally, positive (Darwinian) selection increases, but negative(purifying) selection decreases the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates(dN/dS). The results showed that both dN and dS of S gene of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 versusBat-SARr-CoV RaTG13 were the lowest among all typical coronaviruses, while those ofSARS-CoV Tor2 versus bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 were the second lowest. When the ratioof dN to dS of spike gene is compared, all the tested dN/dS are less than 1, indicating that thesenon-synonymous mutations are harmful, and negative selection will reduce their retention speed.Among them, dN/dS of spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 versus that of Bat-SARr-CoVRaTG13 was 0.04, which was the lowest among all comparisons, reconfirming that the rate ofsynonymous mutation was increased between WIV04 and RaTG13 strains. Moreover, dN/dS rateof polyprotein (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes were similar with that of spike gene (TableThe spike (S) protein undergoes several drastic changes during virus infection. For instance,its large parts are cleaved during infection by cellular proteases and expose the receptors toactivate viral attachment to the host (17). As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike proteinwas involved in interacting with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, theRBD region was thought to be preferential targets of natural selection (18). Consistent with thishypothesis, our results showed that both dN and dS of RBD region are increased in comparisonwith whole spike gene region across all the virus pairs used in this study (Table 1). Notably, thedN/dS ratio of RBD region in SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 was dramatically increased in about 3 fold incomparison with full spike region. Consequently, these mutations may be subjected to Darwin'schoice and will become evidence of adaptive protein evolution.To detect positive selection on the spike gene, the MEME analysis was performed.Significant (p < 0.05) pervasive episodic selection was detected in three sites (48th, 254th, 330thposition using the reference sequence of WIV04). On the 254th position of the spike amino acidsequence, there is a histidine residue instead of a phenylalanine residue, whereas on the 330thamino acidic position in WIV04 sequence, there is a glutamine residue instead of an valine residue.The results described above strongly supporting the action of positive selection in spike geneduring the recent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13. However, this result should beaddressed with careful explain, because the RBD region of spike gene from SARS-CoV-2 was quitdivergent with that of RaTG13 (Fig. S1), suggesting it might have originated from homologousrecombination between RaTG13 and one yet-unknown coronavirus (19).Through comprehensive comparative analysis between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses,we found the synonymous mutations is dramatically elevated between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13than that of other coronavirus strains, and the nucleotide mutations were enriched in T:C transition.The specific mutation pattern may caused by the loss function of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease(ExoN). Moreover, as the SARS-CoV-2 was supposed to be originated from Bat-SARSr-CoVRaTG13, the increased synonymous substitution between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strainsuggested the SARS-CoV-2 genome was under stronger negative (purifying) selection. We alsodetected some sites in spike protein was experiencing positive selection. These observationssuggest that adaptive evolution might contribute to its host shifts. However, as the RNA mutagen(e.g. 5-FU) could induce the same mutation pattern, the mechanism of the mutation patternobserved between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 should be further investigated in future work.We thank all the laboratories submitting the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to GISAID orGenBank database for public research.
