Adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-death, we estimated case and infection fatality ratios (CFR, IFR) for COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess ship as 1.2% (0.38-2.7%) and 2.3% (0.75%-5.3%). Comparing deaths onboard with expected deaths based on naive CFR estimates using China data, we estimate IFR and CFR in China to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.21.2%) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3-2.4%) respectively.", "text": "Aim        In real-time, estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) can bebiased upwards by under-reporting of cases and downwards by failure to account for the delayfrom confirmation-to-death. Collecting detailed epidemiological information from a closedpopulation such as the quarantined Diamond Princess can produce a more comprehensivedescription of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and their subsequent outcomes. Using datafrom the Diamond Princess, and adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-outcome andagestructure of the ship\u2019s occupants, we estimated the IFR and CFR for the outbreak in China.As of 3rd March 2020, there have been 92,809 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), with 3,164 deaths [                Passengers were initially to be held in quarantine for 14 days. However, those that had intenseexposure to the confirmed case-patient, such as sharing a cabin, were held in quarantine beyondthe initial 14-day window [                During an outbreak, the so-called naive CFR (nCFR), i.e. the ratio of reported deaths date toreported cases to date, will underestimate the true CFR because the outcome (recovery ordeath) is not known for all cases [                We assumed the delay from confirmation-to-death followed the same distribution as estimatedhospitalisation-to-death, based on data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, betweenthe 17th December 2019 and the 22th January 2020, accounting right-censoring in the data as aresult of as-yet-unknown disease outcomes (Figure 1, panels A and B) [                \u2211where is the daily case incidence at time , is the proportion of cases with delay betweenonset or hospitalisation and death. represents the underestimation of the known outcomes [                We estimated that the all-age cIFR on the Diamond Princess was 1.2% (0.38\u20132.7%) and thecCFR was 2.3% (0.75\u20135.3%) (Table 1). Using the age distribution of cases and deaths on theship [                Using the age-stratified nCFR estimates reported in a large study in China [        China up to 4th March 2020, nCFR = 2984/80422*100 = 3.71% (95% CI 3.58% - 3.84%); thisnaive value is significantly higher than the corrected CFR we estimate here.Age RangecIFRcCFR9.0% (3.8% - 17%) 18% (7.3% - 33%) Truncated (Figure 1B)No. ofpassengersnCFRexpected deaths under these estimates was 15.15 and age stratified observed/expected deathratios.        The case fatality ratio is challenging to accurately estimate in real time [                The average age onboard the ship was 58, so our estimates of cCFR cannot directly be appliedto a younger population; we therefore scaled our estimates to obtain values for a populationequivalent to those in the early China outbreak. There were some limitations to our analysis.Cruise ship passengers may have a different health status to the general population of theirhome countries, due to health requirements to embark on a multi-week holiday, or differencesrelated to socio-economic status or comborbities. Deaths only occurred in individuals 70 years orolder, so we were not able to generate age-specific cCFRs; the fatality risk may also beinfluenced by differences in healthcare between countries. Because of likely age-specificdifferences in reporting, we focused on overall cCFR in China, rather than calculatingagespecific cCFRs [        TWR, AJK and WJE conceived of the study and collected the data.
