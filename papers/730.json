Our results suggest that by the time a single death occurs,hundreds to thousands of cases are likely to be present in that population. This suggestscontainment via contact tracing will be challenging at this point, and other responsestrategies should be considered. Our approach is implemented in a publicly available,userfriendly, online tool.As the coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19, (1)) epidemic continues to spread worldwide, there ismounting pressure to assess the scale of epidemics in newly affected countries as rapidly aspossible. We introduce a method for estimating cases from recently reported COVID-19deaths. Results suggest that by the time the first deaths have been reported, there may behundreds to thousands of cases in the affected population. We provide epidemic sizeestimates for several countries, and a user-friendly, web-based tool that implements ourmodel.COVID-19 deaths start to be notified in countries where few or no cases had previously beenreported (2). Given the non-specific symptoms (3), and the high rate of mild disease (4), aCOVID-19 epidemic may go unnoticed in a new location until the first severe cases ordeaths are reported (5). Available estimates of the case fatality ratio, i.e. the proportion ofcases that are fatal (CFR, (6,7)), can be used to estimate the number of cases who wouldhave shown symptoms at the same time as the fatal cases. We developed a model to useCFR alongside other epidemiological factors underpinning disease transmission to infer thelikely number of cases in a population from newly reported deaths.Our approach involves two steps: first, reconstruct historic cases by assuming non-fatalcases are all undetected, and, second, model epidemic growth from these cases until thepresent day to estimate the likely number of current cases. We account for uncertainty in theepidemiological processes by using stochastic simulations for estimation of relevantquantities.        Two pieces of information are needed to reconstruct past cases: the number of cases foreach reported death, and their dates of symptom onset. Intuitively, the CFR provides someinformation on the number of cases, as it represents the expected number of deaths percase, so that CFR-1 corresponds to the expected number of cases per death. In practice, thenumber of cases until the first reported death can be drawn from a Geometric distributionwith an event probability equal to the CFR. Note that while our approach could in theory usedifferent CFR for each case (to account for different risk groups), our current implementationuses the same CFR for all cases in a simulation. Dates of symptom onset are simulated fromthe distribution of the time from onset to death, modelled as a discretised Gammadistribution with a mean of 15 days and a standard deviation of 6.9 days (8).Once past cases are reconstructed, we use a branching process model for forecasting newcases (                Further details on model design and parameters values are provided in SupplementaryMaterial. Our approach is implemented in the R software (                We first used our model to assess likely epidemic sizes when an initial COVID-19 death isreported in a new location. We ran simulations for a range of plausible values of R (1.5, 2and 3) and CFR (1%, 2%, 3% and 10%), assuming a single death on the 1st March 2020(7). 25,000 epidemic trajectories were simulated for each parameter combination.Simulations for an \u2018average severity\u2019 scenario (7) with R = 2 and CFR = 2% show that bythe time a death has occured, hundreds to thousands of cases may have been generated inthe affected population (Figure 1). Results vary widely across other parameter settings, andamongst simulations from a given setting (Table 1), with higher R and lower CFR leading tohigher estimates of the numbers of cases. However, a majority of settings give similar resultsto our \u2018average\u2019 scenario, suggesting that a single death is likely to reflect several hundredsof cases. Results were qualitatively unchanged when incorporating heterogeneity in themodel using recent estimates (        We applied our approach to three countries which recently reported their first COVID-19deaths (Spain, Italy, and France), using the same range of parameters as in the single-deathanalysis. In order to compare predictions to cases actually reported in these countries,projections were run until 4th March. Overall, predictions from the model using the baselinescenario (R = 2, CRF = 2%) were in line with reported epidemic sizes (Table 2). Results fromother scenarios are presented in the Supplementary Material. Actual numbers of reportedcases fell within the 50% quantile intervals of simulations in all three countries Italy (median:1 294 ; QI50%: [390 ; 3 034]; reported: 2 037), France (median: 592 ; QI50%: [177 ; 1 705];reported: 190) and Spain, (median: 202 ; QI50%: [95 ; 823]; reported 202).        Several limitations need to be considered when applying our method. First, our approachonly applies to the deaths of patients who have become symptomatic in the locationconsidered, which should usually be the case in places where traveller screening is in place.We also assume constant transmissibility (R) over time, which implies that behaviour changeand control measures have not taken place yet, and that there is no depletion of susceptibleindividuals. Consequently, our method should only be used in the early stages of a newepidemic, where these assumptions are reasonable. Similarly, the assumption that eachdeath reflects independent, additive epidemic trajectories is most likely to hold true early on,when reported deaths are close in time (e.g. no more than a week apart). Used on deathsspanning longer time periods, our approach is likely to overestimate epidemic sizes.Contact tracing has been shown to be an efficient control measure when imported cases canbe detected early on (        The named authors (TJ, SA, AG, CIJ, , TWR, KvZ, SC, SF, HG, YL, CP, NIB, RME, AJK,WJE) had the following sources of funding:TJ, CIJ and AG receive funding from the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) project\u2018RECAP\u2019 managed through RCUK and ESRC (ES/P010873/1).
