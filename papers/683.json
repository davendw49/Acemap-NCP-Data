The World Health Organization officially termed this novel virus COVID-19 and publiclyannounced this on February 11, 2020. Patients infected with COVID-19 can be asymptomaticcarriers[        The Chinese central government implemented lockdown measures in Wuhan and other cities inHubei Province to quarantine core areas of the COVID-19 outbreak on January 23, 2020. Two weekslater, measures to lock down residential units started to be implemented in most cities in China.However, the virus has spread across national borders to several other countries[7]. After the Chinesegovernment decided to lock down cities in January, questions arose regarding the reasons behind anationwide lockdown of residential units that was implemented in February, the impact of thesemeasures on the control of COVID-19 dissemination, and whether they could provide any significantinformation that might help other countries faced with a similar situation. Here, computationalexperiments were conducted to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of the lockdown ofcities and residential units on the prevention and control of the epidemic.The lockdown of core cities and the nationwide lockdown of residential units were importantmeasures adopted by the Chinese government to manage the spread of the epidemic. Lockdownmeasures for COVID-19 epidemic regions were first implemented in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,on January 23, 2020, followed by the progressive lockdown of other cities in the Hubei Province. ByFebruary 7, 2020, the number of new confirmed and suspected cases gradually began to decline inChina (Figure 1A and C). From February 8, 2020, most cities across China had also implementedmeasures to lockdown residential units, and only one person from each household was permitted topurchase essential supplies every two or three days. Residents were required to show an \u201center andexit pass\u201d when entering or leaving their residence, and body temperature had to be checked at bothentry and exit.A sharp increase in the number of confirmed infections on February 13 (Figure 1A andD) was due to adopting the recommendations in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Treatment Planissued by the National Health Commission of China, which stated that a clinical diagnosis could serveas a basis for confirming a diagnosis.new confirmed casesnew suspected casesnew recovery casesnew deaths(B)(D)new confirmed casesnew recovery casesnew suspected cases(A)(C)new confirmed casesnew recovery casesnew suspected cases30002500Medical resources are important factors that can determine the capacity of the core epidemicregions to provide treatments to patients. The 2019 China Statistical Yearbook states that the numberof hospital beds per thousand people ranges from 4.56 to 7.19 in mainland China, and is 6.65 in HubeiProvince (Table 1). However, Hubei was hit hard by the epidemic after the outbreak. A large numberof confirmed infections and a limited number of hospital beds led to the failure of timely treatmentfor many patients, which resulted in severe illness and death.Based on the SEIR model and considering asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers, deaths and themobility of individuals, we constructed a model that included S, A, I, R, and D states (SAIRD). Thestatus of individuals in the SAIRD model primarily included the following transition modes:An S individual who contacts an I individual or an A carrier will have the probability ofbecoming an A carrier.An A carrier might transition to the I state after the incubation period.An I individual will have a specific likelihood of being quarantined and treated, thustransitioning into the R state.An I individual who has not been effectively treated after a specific period might transition intothe D state.In addition, the movements of individuals in I and A states across geographic areas during theCOVID-19 epidemic resulted in rapid spread, resulting in epidemics in other cities. Therefore, thespread of the epidemic caused by human movement was simulated using computational means in thepresent study.The simulation experiments were conducted using MATLAB R2017a and included simulationsof locked down cities (LC) and locked down residential units (LU). Table 2 shows the parametersettings.Computational experiments were conducted in two-dimensional space with a population size ofNU. In the initial phase, NU was randomly and uniformly distributed in NC; that is, the number ofindividuals in each city was NU/NC. One individual in a major city was randomly selected as the firstinfected person. The simulation program ran 200 timeframes, during which individuals might undergospatial movement and a state change at any time frame (for example, daily). First, without consideringthe status of city and residential unit lockdowns, individuals moved to neighboring cities at aprobability of the across-community mobility rate of the population (MU). Secondly, individuals inall cities either changed or maintained their original states based on the rules of the SAIRD model.Table 2. Parameter settings.Variables Definitions Value or distributionNU Number of users 81,000NCDEIDIDFigure 2 shows differences in the ratios of individuals in the five states in the core locked downcities and the ratios of infected users in each city. With respect to timing, if a city was locked downafter an infected user was confirmed and given no residential unit lockdown and no increase inmedical resources, the ratio of individuals in S state would be 0% at steady state; that is, all individualswould be infected. This was without regard to whether the city was under early (Figure 2C), late(Figure 2B), or no lockdown (Figure 2A). Regarding variance in the ratios of D individuals amongall cities, the earlier a city was locked down (Figure 2F, TLC = 5), the greater the variance in theproportions of D individuals state across all 81 cities (VARD ~ 0.05). This indicated that the numberof deaths in the core cities that were under lockdown was significantly higher than in other cities. Bycomparison, variance in the proportions of D individuals across the 81 cities was lower when no citieswere locked down (VARD of ~ 0.02; Figure 2D). Overall, the implementation of measures to placecities under lockdown could not reduce the ratios of infected individuals in the SAIRD model. Theimplementation of measures to lock down cities would result in larger variances in the number ofdeaths between cities with and without lockdown. These findings were consistent with the perspectiveof Li et al. (2020), who reported that the stringent lockdown policy applied to Hubei Province hadsuspended a nationwide outbreak of COVID-19[8]. However, mortality rates in lockdown cities werehigher because infected individuals in core cities were unable to move to other cities.(A) No city lockdownP\uff08S\uff09P\uff08E\uff09P\uff08I\uff09P\uff08R\uff09P\uff08D\uff09VARDVAREWe investigated the impact of adding hospital beds on the spread of the epidemic as follows. TLCand THA were both set at 10. We then examined the proportions of individuals in the five states whenthe hospital beds were increased 2- (DHA=2), 6- (DHA= 6), and 10- (DHA = 10) fold (Figure 3). Theaddition of hospital beds increased cure rates and reduced the mortality rates, but could notsignificantly reduce infection rates. When fewer hospital beds were added (Figure 3A, DHA = 2), theratios of individuals in the R and D state were about 55% and 45%, respectively, at steady state. Whenmore hospital beds were added (Figure 3C; DHA = 10), the ratios of individuals in the R and D stateswere about 85% and 15%, respectively, at steady state.We examined variances in the numbers of individuals in D state across 81 cities. Variance in theproportions of deaths across these cities at a steady state was larger when fewer hospital beds wereadded (Figure 3D; DHA = 2; variance, ~ 0.04). In contrary, variance in the proportions of deathsacross these cities at a steady state was smaller when more hospital beds were added to core cities(Figure 3F; DHA = 10; variance, ~ 0.005). Overall, after implementing measures to lock down thecities, adding more hospital beds effectively improved cure rates and reduced mortality rates.Moreover, adding more hospital beds to core cities resulted in a low variance in the ratios (%) ofdeaths in the 81 cities. This indicated that increasing the amount of medical resources (number ofhospital beds) could effectively reduce mortality rates in cities under lockdown.Figure 4 shows the proportions of individuals in the five states in the SAIRD model and thenumber of available hospital beds after implementing measures to lock down residential units. TheDLU was set at 0.9 and the TLU at 10, 20, and 30. When residential units were placed under lockdownsooner (Figure 4A; TLU = 10), the proportions of individuals in S state when steady state was reachedwas 0.95. This indicated more uninfected, and less infected individuals. Later lockdown (Figure 4C;TLU = 30), resulted in ~ 15% of the population being in the S state when steady state was reached.This indicated less uninfected individuals and more infected individuals. Later implementation ofmeasures to lock down residential units (Figure 4F, TLU = 30), resulted in more I individuals, whichled to a worsened bed shortage (a greater negative peak of available hospital beds). Soonerimplementation of residential unit lockdown measures (Figure 4D, TLU = 10), resulted in lessindividuals becoming infected. Thus, a bed shortage did not arise. Overall, the lockdown of residentialunits effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, particularly when implemented sooner. Thiswas reflected by lower infection rates and a sufficient number of hospital beds.1(A) TLU = 10(B) TLU = 20(C) TLU = 30Further, the TLU was set at 20 and the DLU at 1.0, 0.9, and 0.8, and the proportions ofindividuals in the five states and the number of available hospital beds were examined (Figure 5). Ahigher degree of implementation of measures to lock down residential units led to lower infectionrates (Figure 5A; DLU = 1.0). At steady state, the proportion of S individuals was higher, and almost85% of the individuals were not infected. This result showed that stringent implementation ofmeasures to lock down residential unit could effectively control the spread of the epidemic. If theDLU was relaxed (Figure 5C; DLU = 0.8), the number of infected individuals significantly increasedto 50% and the hospital bed shortages were prolonged. For example, under the complete lockdownof residential units (Figure 5D; DLU = 1.0), hospital bed shortage occurred at time frames of 20 \u2013 40.In contrast, hospital bed shortages occurred at time frames 20 \u2013 140 under non-stringent residentialunit lockdown (Figure 5F; DLU = 0.8). The area under the curve (AUC) for the number of availablebeds that indicated the number of hospital bed shortages in a given period was smaller for completelockdown (Figure 5D; DLU = 1.0) compared with the non-stringent lockdown of residential units(Figure 5F; DLU = 0.8). These findings indicated that more stringent implementation of the measuresto lock down residential units led to lesser hospital bed requirements.Our findings revealed that solely implementing measures to place cities under lockdown couldnot reduce the proportions of infected individuals in the SAIRD model and would also lead to highermortality rates in these cities. Adding a large number of hospital beds along with city lockdownimproved cure rates and reduced mortality rates. Residential unit lockdown effectively control thespread of the epidemic, and sooner implementation of this measure resulted in more effectiveepidemic control.The epidemic control measures adopted by China (city and residential unit lockdown) mightprovide valuable information for other countries. Italy has the worst epidemic situation in Europe.From February 23, 2020, Italy imposed quarantine and lockdown measures on > 12 municipalities,banned public assembly, and closed venues such as schools and bars; these actions were similar tothe situation in Wuhan, China. However, the present findings indicate that Italian government shouldrecommend that their citizens also undergo stringent home quarantine (residential lockdown). Inaddition, medical resources in the affected regions should be increased as soon as possible, andspecialized hospitals for patients infected with COVID-19 should be provided.of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study.
