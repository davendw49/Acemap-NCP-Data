The illness was caused by a novelcoronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom tofatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associatedwith SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratorytest available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real timeRT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods,quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc.. Variations in these factorsmight significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed apeptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of thisassay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patientsinfected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of thisassay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positiverate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. Bycombining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance theaccuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.676869707172737475767778798081828384858687In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, labeled as severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the Coronavirus Study Group [1], has beenidentified as the causative agent of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2]outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province of China [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This disease spreadrapidly by human-to-human transmission [4] from Wuhan to other regions [8],resulting in more than 44,000 COVID-19 cases in mainland China based on thestatistical data until Feb 12, 2020 [9]. Additionally, a total of 78 cases were identifiedin Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and more than 400 cases were identified inThailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, France,Australian and Canada [9]. So far, the number of infected people is still growingsignificantly.Given that effective anti-viral therapeutics are unavailable currently, the first lineof defense is to identify infected-patients as early as possible. Currently, laboratorydiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 has been carried out by detecting viral RNA in throat swabsamples based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay(real-time RT-PCR assay). This real-time RT-PCR method is sensitive and does notrequire live virus present in the specimen. Despite these advantages, such method cangive results that are falsely-negative or falsely-positive due to several limitations, suchas quality of specimen collection, multi-steps of RNA preparation and virus mutation.Another most widely used method is a serological test for the presence of antibodies8990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109against viral proteins. Like sever acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) andMiddle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 are envelopedpositive-sense single-strandedRNA          viruses [          A total of 276 sera were collected from 276 inpatients from three designatedhospitals, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, Yongchuan Hospital Affiliatedto Chongqing Medical University (CQMU), and The Public Health Center, inChongqing, China. These patients were confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCov byreal time RT-PCR detection of virus RNA. Among these sera samples, 168 weretaken from patients with fever symptom. The time points of sampling range from day2 to day 27 from the onset of fever. Ninety-nine of these patients reported exposure topersons with confirmed infection latter. The 200 normal human sera were collectedfrom healthy people more than 1 year before 2019-nCov outbreak. 167 sera frompatients with infection with other pathogens were collected from the Second HospitalAffiliated to CQMU and Children\u2019s Hospital Affiliated to CQMU. These pathogens111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131include influenza A virus (25), respiratory syncytial virus (7), parainfluenza virus (8),influenza B virus(5),adenovirus(6),(8),(10),(2),(3),tuberculosis(4), Hepatitis B virus (33), Hepatitis C virus (22), Syphilis (23) andAll sera samples were inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min. This study was approvedby the Ethics Commission of Chongqing Medical University (CQMU-2020-01).Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the designatedhospital for emerging infectious diseases.We developed a luminescent immunoassay for the detection of 2019-nCovantibody using synthetic peptide antigens as the immunosorbent. Twenty peptides,deduced from the genomic sequence fromGenBank (NC_045512.1), weresynthesized as candidate antigens from the orf1a/b, spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N)proteins. Each kind of peptide was labelled with biotin and the biotinylated peptidewas purified and used to bind to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. For antibodyassay, serum samples (100\u03bcl/each sample) were mixed with the beads carryingcorresponding peptides for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Beads were washed 5 times, reacted to theantibody conjugate, again washed 5 times, and reacted to substrate. Reactivity wasdetermined by a luminescence reader (Peteck 96-I, Bioscience, China).133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153Cut-off value of the test was determined as the mean luminescence value of the200 normal sera plus 5 folds of SD. Sera from 276 COVID-19 patients 167 patientswith irrelevant pathogens were used to evaluate the performance of the assay. Theluminescent immunoassay was performed as described above. Results weredetermined as positive if the signal/cutoff (S/C) ratio \u22651.Twenty synthetic peptides, derived from the amino acid sequence of ORF1a/b,Spike (S) protein and Nucleocapsid (N) protein, were used to develop MCLIA fordetecting IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. To screen these peptides, 5sera from confirmed patients and 10 normal sera were used to react with thesepeptides respectively. Among these peptides tested, one from S protein showed thebest performance. We used the assay based on this peptide for the following study. Todetermine the cut-off value of this assay, serum samples from 200 healthy blooddonorswho donated blood 1-2 years agowere first tested. Themeanchemiluminescence (CL) values for IgG and IgM were 0.152\u00b10.109 and 0.151\u00b10.107,respectively (Fig.1). Cut-off value for IgG and IgM detection were determined as 0.7and 0.7 respectively.To test the specificity of the assays, the serum samples from 167 people infectedwith other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus, influenza B virus,parainfluenzavirus,adenovirus, respiratorysyncytialvirus,mycoplasma,155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174Streptococcus pneumonia, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Candidaalbicans, Staphylococcus aureus were tested. The mean chemiluminescence (CL)values for IgG and IgM in non-SARS-CoV-2 infected people were 0.121 \u00b1 0.062 and0.120 \u00b1 0.065, respectively (Fig.1A-B). These results showed that no cross-reactivitywas observed for these 20 pathogens, indicating a very good specificity.To test stability of this MCLIA based serological diagnosis method, serumsamples with different concentrations were measured 10 times (Fig 2. A, B, C, D),coefficient of variation (CV) of IgG and IgM detection in different concentrationsamples were all below 6% (Fig 2. E, F), which meant a perfect stability of this assayin IgG/IgM detection. Furthermore, series dilutions for 6 serum samples(3 for IgG, 3for IgM) were performed and S/co values were collected, regression analysis revealedS/co value range from 1 to 200 linear reflected serum antibody concentration (IgG,2 2R = -0.902, P<0.001, Fig 3A; IgM, R = -0.946, P<0.001, Fig 3B), assured therationality in further quantitative comparison based on S/co values.Serological Diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with confirmed infectionIgG and IgM were further examined by MCLIA in serum from 276 patients withconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median age of these patients was 48 years(IQR, 37-56; range, 0.66-84years), and 151/276 (54.71%) were men. The mean (CL)values for IgG were 18.62\u00b1 32.87, ranging from 0.05-194.56; IgM were 5.50\u00b122.60,ranging from 0.04-318.16. Majority (197/276; 71.4%) of patients were positive forIgG antibody against the SARS-CoV-2, while 57.2% (158/276) patient were positive176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192193194195196for IgM antibody against the SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 225 patients showed positive forIgM or IgG test and the total positive rate reached 81.52% (225/276) (Table1).and IgMagainstSARS-CoV-2, which, to our knowledge, was the first such assay allowed us to studythe antibody response to the newly identified coronavirus. This assay was based on apeptide from S protein, screened out from 20 candidate peptides deduced from thegenomic sequence. Using synthetic peptide as antigen helps to enhance the stabilityand repeatability of an assay, and theoretically would be more specific than usingvirus as antigen. Indeed, this peptide showed a very good specificity in our assay:none of the 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2reacted with this peptide. This high specificity may be attributed to the relatively lowhomology of this region to other coronaviruses (data not shown).Real time RT-PCR was the only test to confirm the infection of SARS-CoV-2 tillnow.We detected both IgMand IgG in the same sera from the 276infection-confirmed patients. IgG was detected in 71.4% (197/276) of all the sera,higher than the detection rate of IgM (57.2%, 158/276). A combination the twoantibodies enhanced the detection rate to 81.5% (225/276). Different sensitivity of thedetection of IgG and IgM had been reported in SARS [11]. IgG can be detected asearly as 2 days after the onset of fever. IgM was not detected earlier than IgG, similarto the situation in MERS [12], which limits its diagnostic utility. It was reported that19819920020120220320420520620720820921021121221321421521621721820%-50% SARS patients cannot be confirmed by RT-PCR [13], and this elicited aspeculation that there might be a comparable part of infection cannot be detected byreal time RT-PCR. Failure of detection by real time RT-PCR can be caused by theproblems from sampling, RNA extraction and PCR amplification, while detectingantibodies in serum sample avoid a large part of these problems.This work was supported by the Emergency Project from the Science &Technology Commission of Chongqing; The Major National S&T program grant(2017ZX10202203 and 2017ZX10302201) from Science & Technology Commissionof China; The grant (81871635, 81671997 and 81902060) from the NationalNatural Science Foundation of China, and the grant (20180141 and 20170413)from the Science & Technology Commission of Yuzhong district, Chongqing.Alexander E.
