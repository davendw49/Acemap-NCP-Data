These might be designed,for example, to quantify multimorbidity as a covariatein other analyses, for mortality prediction or for riskadjustment. Previous systematic reviews identifiedmultiple indices, but no searches have been done ofindices since 2009.3 4Multimorbidity research most often refers to acount of chronic conditions.4 This method does notreflect patients\u2019 experience or the efects of diferentcombinations or severity of diseases.5 Some indices,however, combine disease counts with severity mea\u00adsures, physiological factors, or demographic items,thereby allowing a more holistic quantification ofillness burden.The coexistence of both physical and mentalillness within multimorbidity is prevalent.6 A 2018report identifying priorities for multimorbidityresearch highlighted the need for more work into thiscoexistence.1 Researchers exploring multimorbiditywill therefore increasingly need to account for mentaldisorders. As previous reviews of multimorbidityindices have not covered mental health in depth weidentified and summarised all community basedmultimorbidity measures that include more thansimple disease counts, paying particular attentionto mental health. This review should help guideclinicians and researchers to select an appropriateindex according to their requirements.No single accepted term describes the methods ofmeasuring multimorbidity. In this review we use theterm \u201cindex\u201d to refer to any method of quantifyingdisease burden or predicting specific outcomes thatincludes more than a count of conditions. This couldbe by weighting conditions (for example, by allocatinga score to each), adding other elements, or exa\u00admining other variables such as drug or physiologicalparameters.s earchTo capture all relevant publications we conducteda broad search. We included a variety of terms formultimorbidity derived from previous systematicreviews on this topic3 4 and other literature discussingterminology in this area of research.7 We developedthe search strategy iteratively with the support of anAcademic Support Librarian. The final search termsare listed in the appendix (appendix eTable 1) andinclude multimorbidity, comorbidity, polypathology,polymorbidity, pluripathology, multi\u00ad condition, andmultiple chronic conditions. The search was restrictedto adults older than 18 years and to English languagepublications.eligibility criteriaWe planned to summarise reports of novel indices andwere primarily interested in the original report of eachindex. Therefore we excluded papers that either usedexisting indices or measured multimorbidity usingonly disease counts. In the initial screening processwe included only the original form of each scale andnot adaptations or updates; these were found later.Records that were not original research papers, such asconference abstracts, letters, and systematic reviews,were excluded. We defined multimorbidity as multipleco\u00ad occurring conditions without reference to a specificdisease, so excluded papers were those that focused oncomorbidities of an index disease or on comorbiditieswithin one disease area (such as the coexistence ofseveral psychiatric conditions). As most people withmultimorbidity are adults living in the community andmanaged in primary care, we excluded articles aboutchildren, animals, or people admitted to hospitalor living in residential care. We included studies ofhospital inpatients when the primary focus was follow\u00adup after discharge (for example, mortality one yearlater). As resources were limited, we excluded paperswhen full texts were not available in English.information sourcesOn 19 October 2018 we searched Medline, Web ofScience Core Collection, Cochrane Library, Embase,PsycINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus from inceptiononwards.s tudy selectionTwo authors used Covidence software independentlyto screen titles against exclusion criteria and thesubsequent abstracts against the same criteria.8 Wethen extracted the full texts of relevant abstractsfor further screening. Any disagreements at thetitle, abstract, and full text stages were resolved bydiscussion, and a third author mediated unresolvedconflicts. We excluded papers that referred to anexisting index, but listed the indices that were usedwhen excluding them at the abstract stage. We found theoriginal papers describing these indices and returnedthem to the title screening stage. Additional relevanttitles were found by reviewing previous systematicreviews on this topic, searching the bibliographies ofincluded full text papers, and tracking their citationsusing Google Scholar. Emerging relevant titles wereadded to the screening process.usage, updates, and validationAfter the list of included papers had been finalised, wesearched their citations on Google Scholar for updates,revisions, or adaptations as well as validation papers.When original indices were adapted and validatednumerous times, we listed the original performance andprincipal adaptations. We did not include adaptationswhere the original index was translated into anotherlanguage with no other changes made. To assess thepopularity of each index, we took the total number ofcitations for each original paper from Google Scholaron 7 September 2019, as a proxy for use. We thencalculated the number of citations for each whole yearsince publication. To retain awareness of the contextof their initial design and aims, we summarised indexupdates separately from the original papers.We created a data extraction tool containing specicfielements of interest for each original index. This tooltook account of previous reviews on this topic as wellas additional information relating to mental health. Weused a broad denfiition of mental health, comprising anymental disorder, including mood disorders, dementia,delirium, and addictions as well as relevant symptoms.Many papers describe validation of the indices used sodetails on the size and demographic distribution of thepopulations under test was important.Two authors independently extracted data from all fulltexts. We compared the consistency of extracted itemsand resolved any diefrences by discussion and referenceto the original paper, with a third author available in caseof substantially diefring data extraction.The variables of interest during data extraction wereifrst author, year of publication, and name of index;original purpose of the index; characteristics of thepopulation under test, including type of data source(eg, cohort study), location, number of participants, sexand age distribution, and mean number of concurrentmedical conditions (when given); components in\u00adcluded in the index; weighting method (if any)and details of model for its development; outcomemeasures; information and resources required toapply the index; internal validation or comparisonwith another index (if applicable); external validationand performance compared with another index (ifapplicable); and inclusion of mental health (either incomorbidities or as outcomes).r isk of reporting bias in original studiesWe assessed the risk of bias of study design and reportingand aimed to develop overall recommendations forindex choice. The Cochrane Collaboration advisesagainst scales that generate total numerical scores,preferring emphasis on individual papers\u2019 performanceon each criterion.9 After our search date the Predictionmodel Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST) waspublished. It focuses on risk of bias and applicabilityin prediction model studies.10 As our search was notrestricted to prediction models, it was not appropriateto apply this tool to every paper. We therefore developedour own list of criteria having referred to resourcesavailable for assessing clinical prediction indices.11\u00ad 13Our assessment aimed to deal with risk of selection,observer, and funding bias. The list contained 10questions on the population tested, description of theindex, statistical methods, validity, and funding. Theassessment tool is available in the appendix (appendixeTable 2), including division into domains. We alsoincluded an overall impression of the papers\u2019 risk ofbias based on the Scottish Intercollegiate GuidelinesNetwork standard, which was scored separately tothe criteria rather than in an additive fashion.14 Tworeviewers independently assessed each paper andresolved disagreements by discussion.When choosing an index, its predictive abilityand its use elsewhere are important. We generatedoverall recommendations taking into accountthe generalisability of participants, selection andclinical relevance of index components, outcomemeasurement, risk of reporting bias, and modelevaluation. These were separated into three maincategories: recommended, potentially useful (usuallywhen indices were applicable to certain situations),and not recommended.s ynthesis of resultsWe anticipated finding a wide variety of indicescovering diverse outcome measures and thereforeplanned to summarise these narratively. Because ofthe range of outcomes included we did not expect to beable to perform meta\u00ad analysis. We listed performanceand validity statistics as reported by the originalpapers or validation studies alongside each other, forcomparison.We did not expect to find indices specificallydesigned for measuring physical multimorbidity inrelation to any aspect of mental health. Therefore, forseparate narrative synthesis we planned to seek thoseindices that mentioned mental illnesses or symptoms,either as comorbidities or as outcomes.An early draft of this paper was discussed with alay contributor who has personal experience ofmultimorbidity. We incorporated her comments intothe text\u2014for example, noting in the introduction thatthe number of conditions a person has might not reflecttheir experience of health, and in the discussion hersuggestions about outcomes that could be important topatients. The lay contributor also commented on a laysummary of the paper (see appendix page 43), whichwe amended accordingly.r esultss tudy selectionThe searches yielded 7128 results. A search ofbibliographies and citations identified 48 additionalrelevant titles, and a further 15 titles were added fromthe list of indices mentioned in excluded abstracts. Thetotal number of titles was therefore 7191. Duplicateswere removed using EndNote X8 and Covidencesoftware,8 15 leaving 5560 unique records for screening(gfi 1). 16 Overall, 5236 titles were excluded at thescreening stage, leaving 324 abstracts for eligibilityassessment.

Table 1 summarisesindex components and outcome variables.

Of the remainder, access to additional freeresources was needed in four,30 43 45 47 informationfrom proprietary scales was needed in one,51 and twowere missing information that would allow the indexto be applied.18 31 One index was only available asproprietary software.34 52Some of the indices, although designed to measuremultimorbidity, were developed in cohorts of peopleOther demographic, clinical andpayment/utilisation informationBernabeu-Wittel et al47*Activities of daily livingindices, hospital admissions,haemoglobinf ig\u00a02 | s pider diagram summarising index components. *Paper appears under more than one categorywith a specicfi disease, and therefore this condition wasnot included in the list of comorbidities.23 31 Most indiceswere based on diagnoses or drugs, but two indicesrequired results of laboratory or other investigations.21 47The provenance of papers will afect theirapplicability to other settings. For example, themajority of papers came from the US where thepredominant health system is commercial andhealthcare costs are of interest to insurers. Some of theindices were designed with a particular population inmind, such as the questionnaire for Indian primarycare. This included diseases that are less prevalentin other geographical areas, such as filariasis andtuberculosis, which might limit generalisability.51Other original indices have domains that might beoutdated.

Two of the indices are riskadjustment methods undergoing regular review andupdates.26 34 The relevant indices are listed in appendixeTable 11 alongside a summary of their adaptationsand updates and any reported performance metrics.The older and widely used indices such as Charlson,Chronic Disease Score, and Cumulative Illness RatingScale have been adapted and updated many times; weinclude the most cited versions. Most updated indicesare broadly based on the aim and outcome measures ofthe original, with some exceptions.57\u00ad 60Of the indices that were not updated, in some casesthis was because the original index was unsuccessfulat predicting specific outcomes 37 or was not designedfor use outside of the original study.30discussionIn this review we collated descriptions of 35 distinctmultimorbidity indices. The papers were diversein study design, intended purpose, and variablesincluded. Similarities did, however, emerge, suchas index components concentrating on conditions,diagnostic categories, drug classes, or physiologicalmeasures. Mortality was the most commonly studiedoutcome, with healthcare use, hospital admission,functional ability, and health related quality of life asother important groups. Those that measure mortalitywill be of most relevance to clinicians and researchers,whereas healthcare use and costs are more usefulto healthcare providers and funders, particularlyin predominantly private healthcare systems. Forpatients, the most relevant outcomes might be qualityof life or self\u00ad reported health.s trengths and weaknesses of this studyA major strength of this review was the use of anupdated search in a rapidly expanding area of re\u00adsearch and a focus on multimorbidity measures thatspecifically include mental health.Although the medical subject heading (MeSH) term\u201ccomorbidity\u201d has existed since 1990, a new MeSHterm, \u201cmultimorbidity,\u201d was introduced in January2018, after our search had been designed and pre\u00adregistered.1 61 We found that the word \u201cindexes\u201d wasused in some titles when we had used \u201cindices\u201d inour search terms. One paper was found by citationtracking and had apparently been missed during oursearch because we had omitted the term \u201cscore.\u201d44table\u00a02 | Overall risk of reporting bias: domain scoress ample selection index descriptionr eference (maximum++) (maximum ++)Corrao et al44 - ++Wen et al42 ++ ++Stanley and Sarfati49 ++ ++Wei et al17 + ++Robusto et al45 + ++Lorem et al50 + ++Pati et al51 ++ ++Hong et al18 ++ ++Wister et al46 ++ +Brettschneider et al48 ++ ++Min et al19 - ++Carey et al40 + ++Dong et al43 + ++Bernabeu-Wittel et al47 ++ ++Mukherjee et al20 ++ ++Newman and Goodman21 ++ ++Tooth et al38 + ++George et al39 - ++Lee et al22 ++ ++Farley et al23 -Byles et al37 ++ ++Bayliss et al24 ++ ++Selim et al25 + ++Pope et al26 ++ ++Sangha et al27 ++ ++Fan et al28 + +Desai et al29 ++ ++Crabtree et al41 - ++Hornbrook and Goodman30 + +Greenfield et al 31 ++ ++Parkerson et al32 ++ ++Von Korf et al 33 - +Starfield et al 34 - ++Charlson et al35 - ++Linn et al36 - +s tatistical methods(maximum ++)+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++validity(maximum +++)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++f unding source(maximum ++)++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++However, we aimed to minimise the number of missedrelevant papers by searching bibliographies, citations,and indices that had been mentioned in the abstractswe excluded. A limitation of this review is that welimited our search to full texts in the medical literature,excluding conference abstracts and other greyliterature. This approach might have missed indicesin clinical use that are either unpublished or based onguidelines from healthcare quality institutions.In this review, we excluded papers that used simplecounts of conditions to measure multimorbidity,focusing instead on indices. We chose to make thisdistinction because indices tend to include multi\u00adple parameters to quantify diferent aspects ofmultimorbidity and use sophisticated models to predictoutcomes. However, as disease counts are the mostcommonly used method of measuring multimorbidity,their exclusion is a limitation of our work.4 The ease ofapplying disease counts means they are frequently usedand they are comparable between studies as long as thelist of candidate conditions is clear.62 One paper in thisreview reported that a count of diagnosis clusters wasa better predictor of healthcare expenditure than morecomplex indices.23 Other research has drawn similarconclusions.63 64 Reviewing the use of disease counts isoutside the scope of this paper and has been discussedelsewhere.65\u00ad 67 Simple counts of drugs have also beenshown to predict healthcare use and mortality,68 andusing these or disease counts are more practical thanindices in many settings. For example, they are usedin clinical care, as they do not require calculationsor particular software, or in large population studieswhere the impact of each condition on individuals isunknown.6As this review is aimed at those undertakingpopulation or community research, we also exclu\u00added studies of people who had been admitted tohospital or live in residential care. This meant thatseveral commonly used indices were not included inthis review, such as the Elixhauser index.69 We didinclude the Charlson, PROFUND, Self\u00ad AdministeredComorbidity Questionnaire, and High\u00ad Risk Diagno\u00adses for the Elderly Scale indices as although thestudies recruited hospital patients, they did so whenthe patients were discharged, and the main period ofinterest was later, in the community setting.27 29 35 47Some of the indices have been in use for many yearsand have several adaptations.

More information is available inanother systematic review on this topic.71Some of the indices were specifically designedfor use with administrative data. These might havescored more poorly on quality assessment as our toolfocused on reporting and clinical applicability. Oursearch also included papers that compared diferentmeasurements of multimorbidity but that werenot intended for clinical use.46 We included thesepapers for completeness when they met our inclusioncriteria. We aimed to find measures of multimorbidity,and our exclusion criteria included studies ofcomorbidity with a specific index disease. However,in two of the papers studied the indices had beendeveloped in populations with one condition only,either hypertension23 or type 2 diabetes.31 We referredto our protocol and included these studies becausetheir aim was to study multimorbidity rather thancomorbidities of those conditions as index diseases.These papers are, however, less generalisable to thegeneral population.Our search was intentionally broad, using a widerange of search terms in multiple medical researchdatabases. We included a variety of studies measuringmultimorbidity from diferent perspectives, which is astrength over previous more specific reviews. 71We generated overall impressions of the risk ofreporting bias and recommendations for index use,Available informationDiagnosesDrugsWith additional informationf ig\u00a03 | f lowchart of recommended indices organised by components and original outcomesto provide a guide for researchers when choosing anindex. Samples in the included studies were, however,heterogeneous, and the indices had varied purposesand components. Therefore, our recommendationsare subjective. Formally comparing the predictiveability of the indices is outside the scope of this workbut has been comprehensively performed by otherinvestigators.68 72\u00ad 74comparison with previous literatureThe two most recent similar systematic reviewsto ours did not formally assess the quality ofpublications.34 Fifteen (43%) of the indices weincluded were published after 2009 and thereforewould not have been found by the searches in theseprevious reviews. This is out of proportion to theincrease in multimorbidity publications since 2010,suggesting that many recent papers have usedeither older measures or disease counts.2 A newersystematic review on this topic focused only on toolsused on administrative data and conducted its searchin 2012.71 A systematic review of multimorbiditysystematic reviews, published in 2018, focusedon definitions and measurement. 5 However, it didnot include a search for new indices, thereby alsoomitting the 15 papers published since 2010.r ecommendations for index selectionWe suggest that to select an index for clinical orresearch use, clinicians or researchers should firstconsider their desired outcomes and the informationavailable. Box 1 summarises the process of selectingan index using this review.AppendixeTables3\u00ad 6listouroverallrecommendations,divided broadly into \u201cnot recommended,\u201d \u201cpotentiallyuseful,\u201d and \u201crecommended,\u201d and gfiure 3 displays the12 indices that we recommend according to their design.The 10 indices that are not recommended could beuseful for other purposes, such as recording symptoms41or comparing models,37 but our recommendations focuson those that are practical for designing multimorbidityresearch.Original outcomesDisease severity,self-rated healthc onclusionsAt least 35 objective measures of multimorbidity areavailable for people living in the community, and eachof these uses diferent variables to generate a score orindex, linked with various or no outcome measures.We found no specific index for investigating theinterplay between mental and physical multimorbidity,although this issue is dealt with in a variety of waysacross the measures. The array of index componentsand outcomes means that a validated measure existsfor many applications, including clinical, research,and cost prediction. It is important when choosingan index to consider its original purpose and theoutcomes for which it is validated. Given the diferingmethodologies of multimorbidity research, it wouldnot be appropriate to assume that a single index coulddefinitively measure multimorbidity in all settings.However, with this research area at risk of saturation,we propose that anyone measuring multimorbidityshould study existing indices before developing newones.aut HOr affiliati Ons1Edinburgh Dementia Prevention, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences,University of Edinburgh, Kennedy Tower, Royal Edinburgh Hospital,Edinburgh EH10 5HF, UK2Division of Psychiatry, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, Universityof Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK3NHS Lothian, St John\u2019s Hospital, Howden, Livingston, UK4University of Malawi College of Medicine, Blantyre, Malawi5Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre, University ofEdinburgh, Edinburgh, UK6NHS Lothian, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, Edinburgh, UKMarshall Dozier, academic support librarian at the University ofEdinburgh, helped with search terms and recommending databases.Mary Nisbet, lay contributor, provided helpful insights from a patient\u2019sperspective.

Because its prevalence is rising as populations age,multimorbidity is attracting increasing attention fromthe research community worldwide.1 More than 2800publications on multimorbidity appeared between1900 and 2016, 80% of which were published after2010.2 As no universally agreed measure or list ofdiseases exists to define multimorbidity, numerousindices have been developed. This review should help guideclinicians and researchers to select an appropriateindex according to their requirements. In this review we use theterm \u201cindex\u201d to refer to any method of quantifyingdisease burden or predicting specific outcomes thatincludes more than a count of conditions. Records that were not original research papers, such asconference abstracts, letters, and systematic reviews,were excluded. As resources were limited, we excluded paperswhen full texts were not available in English.information sourcesOn 19 October 2018 we searched Medline, Web ofScience Core Collection, Cochrane Library, Embase,PsycINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus from inceptiononwards.s tudy selectionTwo authors used Covidence software independentlyto screen titles against exclusion criteria and thesubsequent abstracts against the same criteria.8 Wethen extracted the full texts of relevant abstractsfor further screening. Weused a broad denfiition of mental health, comprising anymental disorder, including mood disorders, dementia,delirium, and addictions as well as relevant symptoms. When choosing an index, its predictive abilityand its use elsewhere are important. Therefore, forseparate narrative synthesis we planned to seek thoseindices that mentioned mental illnesses or symptoms,either as comorbidities or as outcomes. An early draft of this paper was discussed with alay contributor who has personal experience ofmultimorbidity. We incorporated her comments intothe text\u2014for example, noting in the introduction thatthe number of conditions a person has might not reflecttheir experience of health, and in the discussion hersuggestions about outcomes that could be important topatients. 16 Overall, 5236 titles were excluded at thescreening stage, leaving 324 abstracts for eligibilityassessment. One example is the Charlson comorbidityindex.35 This index assigns the maximum weight of 6points to AIDS, but the life expectancy for HIV/AIDS inhigh income countries has changed considerably sincethe index\u2019s publication in 1987.53Although several papers mentioned outcomesas relevant to patient experience, only one clearlydescribed involving patients in the study design, bydeveloping their rating scale with focus groups.37s ummary of evidenceAppendix eTables 3 to 6 summarise all includedpapers according to their index\u2019s original purpose,components and outcome variables, and informationused.

It islikely that more unpublished methods of measuringmultimorbidity exist and are used in clinical practice,especially tailored to specific patient populations oravailable clinical information.usage, performance, and validationAs a proxy for usage, we calculated the number ofannual citations for each paper.
