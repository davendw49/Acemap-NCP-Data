To mitigate the spread of the virus, the Chinese Government hasprogressively implemented metropolitan-wide quarantine in Wuhan and severalnearby cities from Jan 23{24, 2020 [                Chest CT is used to assess the severity of lung involvement inCOVID19 [                Several works are [        We use the following ordinary di erential equation model to simulate theSARSCoV-2 within-host growth:8 dEp(t)>>>>> dt>< dEp (t)> dt>>>> dv(t)>: dt= dE Ep(0)Ep(t)Ep(t)v(t);=Ep(t)v(t)        dE Ep (t);= vEp (t)dvv(t);where Ep(t), Ep (t) and v(t) are the number of uninfected pulmonaryepithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus. is the infectionrate of virus, v is the virus production rate, Ep(0) is the initial value ofuninfected epithelial cells, and the term dE Ep(0) assumes a constant regenerationof uninfected epithelial cells. dE , dE and dv are the death rate of uninfectedpulmonary epithelial cells, infected pulmonary epithelial cells and the virus,respectively. The death rate of Ep(t) is the natural clearance rate of pulmonaryepithelial cells, while, dE and dv are the combination of the natural clearancerate and elimination by the immunity system. This model was also used todescribe the within-lung infection process of u virus [                By the de nition of generation matrix of basic reproduction number R0 [                R0 =vEp(0)dE dv:(1)(2)This number is an important value to measure whether the epidemic or speciescould die out or not [                In this study, the chest radiograph score data from serve patients (with highchest radiograph scores) are collected from the work [        L = XiDi log Ep (ti)Ep (ti)log (Di + 1) ;(3)Ep(0)Ep (0)v(0)vdEdEdv        R0where Di is the smoothed chest radiograph score of the serve patient at time ti,Ep (ti) is the solution of Ep (t) at time ti, and log (x) is log-gamma function,respectively.

The methods we used in this study are following the previous works byMiao et. al [        The major limitation of this study is that the chest radiograph score is notthe real data of the infected pulmonary epithelial cells but just anapproximation. Moreover, we assume that the immunne e ect on viruses and infectedepithelial cells are constant values. This is because the data of antibody ande ective CD8 cells of that virus are rarely known.
