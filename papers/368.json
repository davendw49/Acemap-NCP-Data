It's necessary to simulate epidemic trend of the 2019-nCOV outbreak in Hubei Province, the hardest-hit area. By SEIR simulation, the predicted epidemic peak in Hubei will be within 28th January 2020 to 7th February 2020, up to 7000-9000 infectious cases in total. The estimate above was based on some assumptions and limitations exited. Background and current epidemic situation In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases infected by a novel 2019-nCOV coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 2019-nCOV has demonstrated comparable transmissibility with infamous SARS and MERS, all belonging to the family Coronaviridae [1,2]. Surging with worrisome speed. As of 8am 30th January (Beijing Time) 2020, Approximate 8000 cases across the world have been confirmed, of which 2261 cases confirmed in Wuhan City and 2325 cases confirmed in other cities in Hubei Province [3]. There was a mean 3-7day incubation period. And the most common symptoms of illness were fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue [4]. epidemic peak will be in late February 2020. Effective interventions implemented by Chinese Government, the epidemic will gradually die off in late March 2020. effectively under control (Figure1).", "text": "Due to Spring Festival, nearly 5 million people left off Wuhan before the traffic blockade January10th-22th, 2020. Fortunately, most of travelers above moved around in Hubei Province [7]. As theintense intervention implemented, the outbreak in provinces other than Hubei has beenThe epidemic trend focused on Hubei Province was simulated by a SEIR model. We estimated atotal of approximate 5000 cases of 2019-nCOV in Hubei Province (mainly distributed in WuhanCity) by 22th January 2020. The transmission ratein Hubei was calculated as 0.8 from 12thDecember 2019 (the first 2019-nCOV case tracked) until 22th January 2020 (traffic blockadestarted). Under the intense intervention, we assumed the transmission ratedecreased to0.005-0.1. With the assumption of no resurges resulted by virus mutation or unknownsource of infection, the epidemic peak in Hubei will be within 28th January 2020 to 7thFebruary 2020, up to 7000-9000 infectious cases in total.Compared with SARS in2003, the emergency response capabilities of Chinese government havebeen improved. Interventions or relevant policies, such as free treatment for 2019-nCOVinfectious patients, wildlife trade ban during the plague, traffic control, have been implementedrapidly. All models are wrong, but some are useful! The estimate above was based on someassumptions and limitations exited. Affected by Spring Festival travel, the epidemic has spreadrapidly and trend is difficult to simulate. And further investigations on potential spatiotemporaltransmission pattern are warranted.The total number of cases in Hubei Province by 22th January 2020 is given by [5]:Where the probability any one case will be detected overseas ( ) is given by:*!* \u210e$($#! &!#\" )&\u210e# !The mean time to detection can be approximated by:!\" #!$#!#!%$=&! &##!$#!# !%$$\u2019\"()&\u210e#mean time to detection incubation period 8 mean time from onset of symptoms to detectionDaily international passengers travelling out of Wuhan International Airport = 3301Effective catchment population of Wuhan International Airport=19 millionDetection window (days) =10 daysThe Exported number of confirmed cases by 22th January 2020 = 9Ignoring sporadic cases in cities other than Wuhan, we estimated 5000 cases of 2019-nCOV in Hubei Province by22th January 2020.We proposed a SEIR model to simulate the transmission and trend of 2019-nCov in Hubei Province [6].
