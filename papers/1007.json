Gritfihsin (GRFT) is high-mannose oligosaccharide binding lectin that has shown in vivo broad-spectrum activity against viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus 1, hepatitis C virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro antiviral activities of GRFT and its synthetic trimeric tandemer (3mG) against NiV and other viruses from across 4 virus families. ehT 3mG had comparatively greater potency than GRFT against NiV due to its enhanced ability to block NiV glycoprotein-induced syncytia formation. Our initial in vivo prophylactic evaluation of an oxidation-resistant GRFT (Q-GRFT) showed significant protection against lethal NiV challenge in Syrian golden hamsters. Our results warrant further development of Q-GRFT and 3mG as potential NiV therapeutics.", "text": "All work with infectious virus or infected animals wasconducted in a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory at the Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) followingestablished BSL-4 standard operating procedures approved by theInstitutional Biosafety Committee.          Griffithsin, monomeric GRFT (mGRFT), mGRFT tandemers,and Q-GRFT were expressed and purified as describedpreviously [                    HeLa, HEK293T/17, HT-1080, Vero, Huh7, and BSRT7/5 cells[                    Reporter Virus and Minigenome\u00a0AssaysRecombinant reporter virus assays were performed aspreviously described [          Qualitative and Quantitative Fusion\u00a0AssaysA total of 104 HT-1080 cells were transfected for 4 hours with0.1\u00a0 \u00b5g each of NiV-F AU1 and NiV-G HA expressionplasmids, washed, and replenished with growth media containingGRFT or 3mG. At 24 hours posttransfection, cells were stainedusing CellMask Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DAPIand viewed using a Nikon Axioscope Ti inverted fluorescencemicroscope at \u00d74 magnification.

Cells then were washedand replenished with growth media containing GRFT or 3mG.BSRT7/5 cells (2\u00a0\u00d7 104 ) were then overlaid onto CHO-K1 cells.At ~16 hours postoverlay, green fluorescent NiVglycoproteininduced syncytia were visualized at \u00d72.5 magnification on aCytation5 instrument (BioTek) and counted from photographmontages of each well using Gen5 Software. Fluorescentobjects that were both >75\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter and had a fluorescencereading >5000 were classified as positive syncytia. Additionaldetails are found in the Supplemental Methods.          Ethics Statement and AnimalsAll animal experiments were approved by the CDC InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee and performed in anAAALAC-International approved facility. Groups of 5\u201310 femaleHsdHan:AURA golden Syrian hamsters (6 weeks of age; Envigono.\u00a0 8903F) were inoculated intranasally (IN) with Dulbecco\u2019smodified Eagle\u2019s medium or NiV-B (107 TCID50). On 1 and 2\u00a0dayspostinfection (dpi) and/or -1 and -2 dpi, animals were treated INwith vehicle control (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]), GRFT(10\u00a0 mg/kg), or 3mG (10\u00a0 mg/kg). Hamsters were humanelyeuthanized with isoflurane vapor when they met euthanasia criteriaor at the completion of the study (28 dpi). Additional clinicalscoring details are found in the Supplementary Methods.Quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain ReactionRibonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from blood andhomogenized tissue samples using the MagMAX-96 Total RNAIsolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on a 96-well ABIMagMAX extraction platform with a DNaseI treatment stepaccording to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA wasquantitated using one-step real-time reverse-transcription polymerasechain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the N gene sequence [                    Total NiV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizingantibodies were measured as previously described [          All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism8.1.2. Animal survival was analyzed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox)and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test. Quantitative fusion assayand virus yield comparisons between GRFT and 3mG wereanalyzed using multiple t tests with adjusted P values. Fiftypercent effective concentrations and 50% cytotoxic concentrationswere calculated using 4-parameter variable slope nonlinearregression fitting of mean values of all antiviral assays.        Griffithsin Inhibits Nipah Virus Reporter Gene Expression and InfectiousVirus Production, but Not Viral Ribonucleic Acid Transcription orReplicationWe initially tested GRFT against a reporter NiV expressing Renillaluciferase (rNiV-RLuc) [        EC50: 1.42 \u03bcg/mL~ 55.3 nMEC50: 1.25 \u03bcg/mL~ 48.8 nMGRFT (\u03bcg/mL)        HT-108011150ytivitca100cuLRiV 50Nr%oligosaccharides found commonly on viral envelopeglycoproteins [        HEK-293TVeroC(NiV-G His6\u00d7) surface glycoproteins (Supplemental FigureS1A\u2013C). We used GRFT to probe against NiV-F AU1 and NiV-GHis6\u00d7 by Western blot, and we observed detection of bothproteins (Figure 2A, left panel, well no.\u00a0 6 NiV-F AU1, well no.\u00a0 10NiV-G). To further characterize these interactions, we performedELISA binding assays by titrating increasing levels of GRFTagainst the purified glycoproteins, and we observedcomparatively greater binding to NiV-G than to NiV-F (Figure 2A, rightpanel). We then conducted time-of-addition experiments todetermine how long after infection could GRFT still inhibit virusreplication. We either incubated serial dilutions of GRFT withrNiV-RLuc for 2 hours before infection or added GRFT at 0, 2, 6,or 12 hpi. Although a 2-hour preincubation of GRFT withrNiVRLuc showed negligible differences in inhibition compared withGRFT treatment at 0 hpi, gradually increasing reporter activitycorrelated with longer delays before GRFT treatment (Figure2B, left panel). It is notable, however, that even when GRFT wasadded 12 hpi, at concentrations of \u2265~40\u00a0nM GRFT reporteractivity was still reduced compared with untreated control infectedcells. Dose-response curves for reporter activity indicated anapproximately 5- to 6-fold decrease in potency between 0 and 12hpi treatments, with GRFT treatments at 2 or 6 hpi showing anintermediate 2- to 3-fold comparative decrease to 0 hpi treatment(Figure 2B, right panel).To determine whether GRFT inhibition of NiV could beovercome by more virus, we used increasing amounts of rNiV-RLucto infect GRFT-pretreated cells. We observed a dose-dependentincrease in reporter activity against ~40\u00a0nM of GRFT in 2 celltypes, but at higher concentrations of GRFT (~120\u2013360\u00a0 nM),there were only minimal increases in reporter signal (Figure 2C,left and right panels). This indicated that higher concentrationsof GRFT may better inhibit NiV entry and spread indirectly viabinding to cellular glycoproteins.To visualize GRFT-mediated inhibition of NiV spread, weperformed immune uflorescence assay of cells infected withrNiV before treatment with GRFT. In untreated infected cells,we observed large holes in the cell monolayer caused byNiVinduced syncytia, with widespread NiV nucleoproteinantigen present (Figure 2D, top leftmost panel). With increasingamounts of GRFT, we observed smaller syncytia concomitantwith a visible decrease in infected cells (Figure 2D, top 3 rightpanels). Cells treated with GRFT were positively stained withan anti-GRFT polyclonal antibody, indicating GRFT binding tocell-surface glycoproteins (Figure 2D, bottom 3 right panels).        Trimeric Griffithsin Tandemer Has Enhanced Potency Against Nipah\u00a0VirusThe presence of more than 1 oligosaccharide-binding face inthe dimeric form of GRFT is crucial to maintain its potentantiHIV-1 activity [        Supplementary Figures S2A\u2013D and S3A and B).2019:XX (XX XXXX) \u2022 S5Downloadedfromhttps://academi.coup.comij//dadvancealitrceabstract/doi/10.1093i/fndiji/sz630/5731546bygueston26March20200.0150yiittvca 100cuLRiV 50Nr%\u03b1-NiV N,DAPIConcentration (\u03bcg/mL)10100CD150yitvitca100cuLRiV50Nr150noiit100bihniEP 50C%150noiit100bihniEP 50C%0.0150slle 100c+PFG 50%00.0150slle 100c+PFG 50%03-fold serial dilutions of GRFT or 3mG for 24\u00a0hours (left panel) concurrently with infection or pretreated for 1\u00a0hour (right panel) before infection with replication-decfiient VSV particlespseudotyped either with VSV-G glycoprotein (VSVpt) or the NiV-F and NiV-G glycoproteins (NiVpt).

We did not observe significantdiefrences in antiviral potencies at equivalent compoundconcentrations under both continuous GRFT/3mG treatment orwith only 1 hour of pretreatment before infection (Figure 3D,left and right panels, respectively).3mG More Efficiently Reduces Syncytia Formation and Infectious\u00a0YieldWe tested the abilities of GRFT and 3mG to block NiV-F andNiV-G glycoprotein-induced syncytia formation by treatingtransfected cells expressing both NiV-F and NiV-Gglycoproteins with either compound, and we observed that 3mG visiblyinhibited syncytia formation more efficiently than GRFT atequivalent concentrations (Figure 4A). To confirm this result,we developed a quantitative image-based syncytia countingassay. Whereas cells transfected only with NiV-F plasmid hadminimal background syncytia counts, cells transfected withboth NiV glycoproteins had >1000 syncytia counts (Figure 4B,left panel). Using this assay, we observed a dose-dependentdecrease in syncytia counts that correlated with increased levelsof GRFT or 3mG, but we noted that 3mG more efficientlyreduced syncytia than GRFT at higher concentrations (Figure4B, right panel). When Vero cells were treated with GRFT or3mG after infection by either green fluorescent reporter NiV(rNiV-ZsG) or NiV-B, 3mG reduced virus yield more efficientlythan GRFT, similarly reflecting their differing abilities to blocksyncytia formation (Figure 4C, left and right panels,respectively). Accordingly, 3mG visibly delayed or reduced the sizeof syncytia formation more efficiently than GRFT in rNiV-ZsGinfected cells (Figure 4D).
