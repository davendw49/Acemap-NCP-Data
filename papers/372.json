As an important transportation center, the migration of Wuhan accelerated the wide spread of 2019-nCoV across mainland (Figure 1a). Although the closure of the city has been implemented, more than 5 million people have left Wuhan in the recent days2. Based on cumulative Baidu migration index (CBMI)3 from January 16 to January 25, 2020, we found that 74.1% of Wuhan's migrant population went to other cities in Hubei, 5.6% Wuhan's migrant population has entered Henan, and other provinces account for a small proportion (Figure 1b). In Hubei Province, most migrant population from Wuhan entered Xiaogan (20%), Huanggang (19%), and Jingzhou (10%) (Figure 1c).", "text": "of 2020 (Figure 1e, R2 = 0.81, p <0.0001). We further found that the correlationbetween Wuhan CBMI and reported cases was very stable in other non-Hubei regionsof mainland China (Figure 1f, R2 = 0.43-0.51) and other non-Wuhan cities in HubeiProvince (Figure 1f, R2 = 0.62-0.88). Our results confirm that there is a significantcorrelation between the export population of Wuhan and reported cases in variousregions.In Figure 1d, we also observed that the reported cases are relatively small,although Wuhan CBMI in Henan Province is large (5.6%, Figure 1b). We speculatethat Henan Province\u2019s earlier intervention measures (such as traffic control anddesignated hospitals) effectively reduced the proliferation of 2019-nCov4.In addition, the total number of reported cases in Zhejiang Province was higherthan expected (Figure 1d). In Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou was the city mostfrequently traded with Wuhan, had the highest number of reported cases. FromJanuary 19th to January 23rd, 2020, Wenzhou's Wuhan CBMI (0.11) ranked first inZhejiang Province. We speculated that some patients returned to Wenzhou beforeWuhan closed the city, resulting in the widespread propagation of 2019-nCoV inWenzhou. Similarly, Guangdong Province and Wuhan had close economic ties andpersonnel exchanges, leading to a higher risk of infection with 2019-nCoV.Subsequently, we further analyzed the mortality rate of 2019-nCoV pneumonia indifferent regions (Figure 1g). We found that the mortality rate in Hubei Province(3.24%; Wuhan: 5.45%) was much higher than that in other regions of mainlandChina (0.19%). We have also found that the investigation of potential cases in Wuhanwas far behind other provinces in Mainland China (Figure 1h). We speculated thatthis might be related to a large number of patients, limited medical resources, and thelack of manpower to track suspected cases.From a public health perspective, effective isolation and reduced exposure topatients who have been diagnosed are the most important. Our results confirm that themandatory traffic segregation in Wuhan has greatly reduced the nationwide spread of2019-nCov. At the same time, our results also show that the export of the populationin Wuhan before the closure of the city will lead to the spread of severe epidemics inother cities in Hubei.Health Commission of Hubei Province.
