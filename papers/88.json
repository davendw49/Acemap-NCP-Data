Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd < 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective", "text": "        Coronaviruses (CoVs), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, are positive-sense enveloped RNAviruses and cause infections in birds, mammals, and humans (        In this study, we applied our pre-trained MT-DTI model to identify commercially available antiviral drugsthat could potentially disrupt 2019-nCoV\u2019s viral components, such as proteinase, RNA-dependent RNApolymerase, and/or helicase. Since the model utilizes simplified molecular-input line-entry system(SMILES) strings and amino acid (AA) sequences, which are 1D string inputs, it is possible to quicklyapply target proteins that do not have experimentally confirmed 3D crystal structures, such as viralproteins of 2019-nCoV. We share a list of top commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentiallyhinder the multiplication cycle of 2019-nCoV with the hope that effective drugs can be developed basedon these AI-proposed drug candidates and act against 2019-nCoV.Amino acid sequences of 3C-like proteinase (accession YP_009725301.1), RNA-dependent RNApolymerase (accession YP_009725307.1), helicase (accession YP_009725308.1), 3'-to-5' exonuclease(accession YP_009725309.1), endoRNAse (accession YP_009725310.1), and 2'-O-ribosemethyltransferase (accession YP_009725311.1) of the 2019-nCoV replication complex were extractedfrom the 2019-nCoV whole genome sequence (accession NC_045512.2), from the National Center forBiotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The raw prediction results were screened for antiviraldrugs that are FDA approved, target viral proteins, and have a Kd value less than 1,000 nM.Molecule transformer-drug target interaction (MT-DTI) was used to predict binding affinity valuesbetween commercially available antiviral drugs and target proteins. Briefly, the natural languageprocessing (NLP) based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) frameworkis a core algorithm of the model with good performance and robust results in diverse drug-targetinteraction datasets through pretraining with \u2018chemical language\u2019 SMILES of approximately1,000,000,000 compounds.          To train the model, the Drug Target Common (DTC) database (                  The 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase was predicted to bind with atazanavir (Kd 94.94 nM), followed byefavirenz, ritonavir, and other antiviral drugs that have a predicted affinity of Kd > 100 nM potency (Table1). No other protease inhibitor antiviral drug was found in the Kd < 1,000 nM range. Although there isno real-world evidence about whether these drugs will act as predicted against 2019-nCoV yet, somecase studies have been identified. For example, a docking study of lopinavir along with other HIVproteinase inhibitors of the CoV proteinase (PDBID 1UK3) suggests atazanavir and ritonavir, which arelisted in the present prediction results, may inhibit the CoV proteinase in line with the inhibitory potencyof lopinavir (        In many cases, DTI prediction models serve as a tool to repurpose drugs to develop novel usages ofexisting drugs. However, the application of DTI prediction in the present study may be useful to controlunexpected and rapidly spreading infections such SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV at thefrontline of the disease control until better therapeutic measures are developed. Nevertheless, we hopeour prediction results may support and helpful to experimental therapy options for China and othercountries identified 2019-nCoV infection.markets against a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, NCBI reference sequence NC_045512.2) 3C-likeproteinase (accession YP_009725301.1).
