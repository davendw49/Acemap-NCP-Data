SARS-CoV-2is a betacoronavirus and shares genetic sequence and viralstructure with both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus(SARS-CoV; 70% similarity), which caused 349 deaths during2002\u201303 in China, and Middle East respiratory syndromecoronavirus (MERS-CoV; 40% similarity).1 As of 3 March 2020, a total of80 302 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 2947 deaths, hadbeen reported in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.A rapidly growing number of COVID-19 cases had also beenreported from Japan, South Korea and Italy.The number of COVID-19 cases is still on the rise. The mediantime from first symptoms to ARDS is 8 days (IQR 6\u201312 days).2The transition to ARDS occurs in many severe COVID-19 cases.A possible explanation for this rapid and serious deterioration is thecytokine release syndrome (CRS), or \u2018cytokine storm\u2019, anoverproduction of immune cells and cytokines that leads to rapidmulti-organ system failure and fetal damage to tissues of thelungs, kidney and heart.3 Developing an effective approach tomodulate the immune response or suppress overreactive cytokineproduction is of crucial importance in reducing disease aggravationand the mortality rate. There is an urgent need to identify effectiveand safe medical agents to treat this disease.Several antiviral drugs have been tested for efficacy in inhibitingSARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Two drugs have exhibited apromising inhibitory effect: remdesivir (GS-5734), an experimentaldrug being developed for the treatment of Ebola virus infection;and chloroquine (CQ), a drug well-known for its effectiveness intreating malarial and autoimmune disease.4 Notably, remdesivirhas demonstrated antiviral activity in treating MERS and SARS inanimal models, both of which are caused by coronaviruses.5 As anemergent therapeutic approach, approval was given for remdesivirto have its treatment effect tested in a group of COVID-19 patients.The clinical trial is currently ongoing at several hospitals in Wuhanand the results regarding effectiveness and safety are awaited.The EC90 of CQ for SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells is 6.90 lM,4 which isclinically achievable, well tolerated in patients with rheumatoidarthritis and potentially applicable to COVID-19 patients. Severalrandomized controlled trials have been conducted to testthe effect of CQ in treating COVID-19. Therapeutic effects wereobserved in aspects of fever reduction, improvements on CTimaging and retarded disease progression. CQ has beenofficially declared as a medical agent for COVID-19 in the sixth editionof the New coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatmentplan, released by the National Health and Care Commissionof China on 19 February 2020. The recommended dosagefor adults is 500 mg/day, which is the maximum sustainabledosage in the human body.With a chemical structure very similar to that of CQ (Figure 1), HCQis one of the disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).The DMARDs are widely used for treating many rheumatic diseasesand also demonstrate a strong immunomodulatory capacity,which prevents inflammation flare-ups and organ damage.6 HCQand CQ are considered to be immunomodulators rather thanimmunosuppressants (Figure 2). In particular, HCQ can increasethe intracellular pH and inhibit lysosomal activity inantigenpresenting cells (APCs), including plasmacytoid dendritic cells(pDCs) and B cells, so preventing antigen processing and majorhistocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-mediated autoantigenpresentation to T cells.7 This process reduces T cell activation,differentiation and expression of co-stimulatory proteins (e.g. CD154on CD4! T cells)8 and cytokines produced by T cells and B cells(e.g. IL-1, IL-6 and TNF).9 Meanwhile, due to the altered pH ofendosomes and interrupted binding between toll-like receptors(TLR7 and TLR9) and their RNA/DNA ligands, TLR signalling issuppressed by administration of HCQ.10\u201313 In the cytoplasm, HCQalso interferes with the interaction between cytosolic DNA andthe nucleic acid sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase(cGAS).14 As both TLR signalling and cGAS stimulation of interferongenes (the STING pathway) are impeded by HCQ, subsequentproinflammatory signalling activation and production of cytokines,such as type I interferons, IL-1 and TNF, are attenuated.9 Suchmechanisms give strong support to the hypothesis that HCQ islikely to confer an ability to suppress the CRS, which is due tooveractivation of the immune system triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection,through which progression of the disease from mild to severemight be attenuated. Therefore, careful clinical examination isurgently required to validate this hypothesis.In addition to a role in immune modulation, HCQ and CQ inhibitreceptor binding and membrane fusion, two key steps that arerequired for cell entry by coronaviruses. CQ has been shown toexert an antiviral effect during pre- and post-infection conditionsby interfering with the glycosylation of angiotensin-convertingenzyme 2 (ACE2) (the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV) and blockingvirus fusion with the host cell (Figure 2). Impaired terminalglycosylation of ACE2 may reduce the binding efficiency between ACE2 onhost cells and the SARS-CoV spike protein. Thus, the binding of thevirus to the receptors on the cells is impeded and infection isconsequently prevented. Once HCQ and CQ enter a cell they are bothconcentrated in organelles with low pH, such as endosomes, Golgivesicles and lysosomes. As the virus uses endosomes as a cellularentry mechanism, increasing the pH of endosomes through CQtreatment places a negative influence on the fusion process ofvirus and endosome.15 Lysosomal proteases activate the fusionNOHprocess between host and viral membranes by cleavingcoronavirus surface spike proteins.16 Increasing the pH of the lysosomeprevents protease activity such that this fusion process isdisrupted.17 Without the pH necessary for the endosome andlysosome to execute the cleavage function, replication of and infectionby the coronavirus are blocked.18 Inhibition of SARS-CoV spreadwas observed in cells treated with CQ prior to or after infection,suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages of CQ incombating SARS-CoV.15 Given that HCQ demonstrates similarmolecular mechanisms to CQ, it is highly likely that HCQ will performsimilarly in terms of early prevention and disease progression.Again, this requires careful in vitro and in vivo testing.Both HCQ and CQ have a good safety record and are welldistributed throughout the whole body after oral administration,especially in acidic compartments such as lysosomes and inflamedtissues. Another advantage of HCQ and CQ is that they do not bringrisks of infectious complications, unlike immunosuppressantdrugs such as methotrexate and leflunomide.19 Gastrointestinalresponses, such as vomiting and diarrhoea, are the most commonadverse effects of these two drugs.20 Patients with long-termexposure to CQ suffer from severe side effects, such as retinopathy,circular defects (or bull\u2019s eye maculopathy), diametric defects in theretina and cardiomyopathy.17 Elderly patients and usage beyonddosage limits are also associated with toxicities of CQ therapy.In contrast, HCQ has a lower level of tissue accumulation,17 whichmay explain the fact that it is associated with fewer adverseevents than CQ, but still potentially influences the prevention andtreatment of malaria to a similar level. Indeed, only high-dose andlong-term (over 5 years) intake of HCQ is likely to contribute tothe development of retinopathy,21 which is in agreement with thecurrent preference of HCQ use in therapy. While CQ exerts a numberof severe side effects on fetal development, HCQ is stronglyrecommended for pregnant patients with an autoimmune disease asit prevents the development of congenital heart block due to apotential inhibitory effect of type I interferon production.22,23The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has placed many pregnant women athigh risk of infection (several infected cases have been reported);HCQ, rather than CQ, should be considered as a potentialtherapeutic solution for these patients, given its safety profile in pregnancy.More importantly, the maximum tolerable dose for HCQ is 1200 mg,which has an antiviral effect equivalent to 750 mg CQ (for which themaximum tolerable dose is 500 mg).24 This indicates that HCQ canbe administered at a higher dosage and may therefore achieve amore powerful antiviral effect.In summary, we propose that HCQ could serve as a bettertherapeutic approach than CQ for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2infection. There are three major reasons for this: (i) HCQ is likely toattenuate the severe progression of COVID-19 through inhibiting thecytokine storm by reducing CD154 expression in T cells; (ii) HCQmay confer a similar antiviral effect at both pre- and post- infectionstages, as found with CQ; (iii) HCQ has fewer side effects, is safe inpregnancy and is cheaper and more highly available in China.Given the fast-growing number of COVID-19 patients and theChloroquine (CQ)Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)urgent need for effective and safe drugs in the clinic, it is morepractical to identify reliable candidates by screening currentlyavailable drugs. We herein strongly urge that clinical trials areperformed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ on both infectionand malignant progression.None to declare.3 of 417 Schrezenmeier E, Dorner T.
