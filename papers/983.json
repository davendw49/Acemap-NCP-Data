(18December 1831)\u2019A new decade with a newish government in the UK andof course Brexit is upon us. What opportunities andchallenges will this decade bring? More people around the worldare living better lives compared to just a decade ago andhave access to better healthcare, fair wages for appropriatework and education. Despite these achievements, globally,inequalities prevail\u2014people in rich countries on average live\u223c18 years longer than those in poorer countries and withincountries health discrepancy between the haves and have-notscontinues. Populations face a complex mixture ofinterconnected threats to their health and well-being from poverty andinequality to conflict and climate change.2Several of the articles in this issue explore these topicsand the efectiveness and evidence base of interventions andpolicies. The online article \u2018Armed conflict and public health:into the 21st century3\u2019 brings to focus the challenges facingPublic Health. The perspectives article by Halliday et al .4highlights the efect of spatial stigma on health inequalities.Z\u00f6lzer5 in the article on Ethics of Radiological Protectionemphasizes the importance of \u2018the necessity of acrosscultural approach\u2019 when developing ethical frameworks andguidance. Jennings\u2019 article \u2018Ethics codes and reflective practicein public health\u20196 underlines the importance of public healthpractitioners receiving a good grounding in ethics as part oftheir education and training.As I write this editorial, we are just 2 weeks into the 20s andare already witnessing tensions and uprising in various regionsof the world,7\u20139 the catastrophic efects of climate changein the devastating forest fires in Australia and the emergenceof a new strain of coronavirus in China. Yet, there is alsooptimistic news that many cities10\u201312 and organizations13,14are planning to reduce their carbon emissions and announcinginitiatives to fund innovations to accelerate carbon reduction,capture and removal technologies.The UN General Assembly designated the 20s as a \u2018Decadeof Action\u2019. The UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres,called on all sectors of society to mobilize for a decadeof action on three levels: global action to secure greaterleadership, more resources and smarter solutions.15 Recently,Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of theWorld Health Organization, highlighted the importance ofinvesting in public health when setting out his urgent globalhealth challenges for the next 10 years.Global advocacy groups have named 2020 a \u2018super year\u2019for activism and action. They advocate activism and actionto reach the people furthest behind and rebalancing therelationship between people and nature through supporting bothlocal initiatives and innovation. Virginia Berridge\u2019s 2007 BMJarticle \u2018Public health activism: lessons from history?\u201916outlines how knowledge about public health campaigns from thepast can help current health campaigners to draw up efectivestrategies. She argues that networks of health organizationsand pressure groups are vital as they have \u2018first establishedthe area of concern at the national (and sometimes local) leveland then developed it internationally\u2019. Berridge\u2019s article is asrelevant today as it was over a decade ago. She states \u2018activismhas a dual and interconnected rationale\u2014pushing for policychange but also helping to achieve cultural change\u2019.UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed calls2020, \u2018the year we must change course\u2019. How can PublicHealth contribute to changing the course? The Chile/MadridClimate Change Conference ended with mixed results,raising questions about tools for collectively addressing globalchallenges. Of course, Public Health can contribute throughdeveloping and strengthening the evidence base andassessing the efectiveness of policies. However, Public Healthhas another important role to play if it is to contribute to\u2018changing the course\u2019. Jarman et al 17 in their online article\u2018Brexit is just a symptom: the constitutional weaknesses itreveals have serious consequences for health\u2019 state \u2018weakaccountability, executive dominance and lack of transparencyall have profound implications for health policy\u2019 and are ofthe opinion that \u2018few of the political mechanisms adopted inrecent years that could have constrained executive dominancehave proven to be efective\u2019. To change course the role ofpublic health should include critically examining not just thetools and processes but also the systems and institutions thathave the power to influence and manipulate the opportunitiesand challenges to reach the crucial global goals.Parallels are already being drawn between this new decadeand the 1920s, the so-called Roaring Twenties, a period ofeconomic prosperity with a distinctive cultural edge in theUnited States and Europe. It was characterized by modernJOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTHtechnology with the proliferation of cars, telephones, movies,radio and electrical appliances and accelerated consumerdemand. It is said to be the dawn of celebrity culturewhen sports heroes and movie stars were venerated. Theend of the era was marked by the Wall Street Crash of1929. The British historian, Lucy Moore noted that systemicweaknesses underlay the efervescence of the era masking theunderlying poverty and inequalities. In her book \u2018AnythingGoes: A Biography of the Roaring Twenties\u201918 she wrote:\u2018the crash did not cause the Depression: that was part of a farbroader malaise. What it did was expose the weaknesses thatunderpinned the confidence and optimism of the 1920s\u2014poor distribution of income, a weak banking structure andinsuficient regulations, the economy\u2019s dependence on newconsumer goods, the overextension of industry and theGovernment\u2019s blind belief that promoting business interestswould make America uniformly prosperous.\u2019In this \u2018super year\u2019 of activism and action Public Healthshould keep Moore\u2019s analysis in mind and learn lessons fromthe past to ensure Public Health\u2019s activism and actions areefective.", "ref_list": [[], ["Talk ("], ["2 Independent Group of Scientists appointed by the Secretary-General"], ["Armed conflict and public health: into the 21st century"], ["The elephant in the room?
