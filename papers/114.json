SinceSARSCoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discoveredthousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions.Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for theirability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonoticviral outbreak. Herewe developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage Bbetacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usageand their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host proteaseprocessing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and thatbypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through anunknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombineto gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for therecently emerging 2019-nCoV.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged inhumans in 2003 after transmitting from animals in open air markets in China1,2. Shortlythereafter, several genetically related viruses were identified in Chinese Horseshoes bats(Rhinolophus sinicus)3-7. At the same time, improvements in next generation sequencingtechnology lead to a boom of virus discovery, uncovering thousands of novel virussequences in wild animal populations around the world. While most of these viruses havenever been found in humans, many are genetically similar to known human viruses withinthe betacoronaviruses (\u03b2-CoV) genus. The \u03b2-CoVs are further divided into four lineages:lineage B, which includes SARS-CoV and the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, hasapproximately 200 published virus sequences whereas lineage C, which includesMERSCoV, has over 500 viral sequences.Every year, additional novel CoV sequences are discovered. However, there is amassive knowledge gap in the field as very little work is performed after the viralsequences are published. Therefore, it is unknown whether these novel viruses have thepotential to emerge in human populations.Current methods for studying novel \u03b2-CoVs are technically demanding. Viralisolation from field samples is rarely successful and reverse genetics recovery ofrecombinant virus is labor-intensive, and expensive as synthesis of a single genome cancost upwards of $15,000. These limitations are prohibitive to studying novel CoVs at thescale in which they are discovered.Cell entry is an essential component of cross-species transmission, especially forthe \u03b2-CoVs. All CoVs encode a surface glycoprotein, spike, which binds to the host-cellreceptor and mediates viral entry8. For \u03b2-CoVs, a single region of the spike protein calledthe receptor binding domain (RBD) mediates the interaction with the host cell receptor.After binding the receptor, a nearby host protease cleaves the spike, which releases thespike fusion peptide, facilitating virus entry9-12. Known host receptors for \u03b2-CoVs includeangiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4) for MERS-CoV13,14.Structural studies of coronaviruses have shown that the spike RBD is capable offolding independently from the rest of the spike protein and contains all of the structuralinformation for host receptor binding15. Additionally, a previous study showed thatreplacing the RBD of the lineage B bat virus, Rp3, allowed the virus to enter cellsexpressing human ACE2 (hACE2)16. We therefore developed a method to functionallytest the RBDs from novel lineage B \u03b2-CoVs in place of the SARS-CoV spike RBD (figure1). Synthesizing just the RBD of spike is much faster and cost-effective than conventionalpseudotyping methods that rely on synthesis of the full ~4kb spike sequence for novelCoVs: a process that can take weeks and is cost-prohibitive for large panels of spikesequences. The short turnaround time for our approach allowed us to test the receptorusage of all published, unique RBD sequences in lineage B, and also rapidly confirm theACE2 receptor usage of the 2019-nCoV spike, which emerged in China in January 2020as our study was ongoing.We show that lineage B RBDs divide into functionally distinct clades and thatseveral previously-unappreciated viruses exhibit compatibility with an unknown receptoron human cells. We also show that these clades are capable of recombining to imparthuman host-cell entry phenotypes, and that, beyond the RDB-receptor interaction, hostprotease processing is another species barrier encountered by lineage B \u03b2-CoVs during293T, A549, BHK, Caco-2, Huh-7.5, PK-15, and Vero cells were maintained inDMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine.RhiNi/40.1, AJ-primary, AJi, HypNi, RaKSM-2.5i, RhiLu, and RhiNi cells were maintainedin DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 12% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin,nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate and L-glutamine. AJ-primary cells wereimmortalized with a lentiviral vector expressing SV40 T-antigen following themanufacturer\u2019s instructions to generate AJi cells (abm; #G203). RaKSM-2.5 primary cellshave been previously described and were immortalized in this study similar to AJi cells17.The spike coding sequences for SARS-CoV Urbani, As6526, and BM48-31 werecodon optimized for human cells, appended with a 5\u2019 kozak expression sequence(GCCACC) and 3\u2019 tetra-glycine linker followed by nucleotides encoding a FLAG tagsequence (DYKDDDDK). For SARS-CoV spike, silent mutations were introduced aroundcodons 308 and 519 to form KpnI and XhoI digest sites. For As6526 spike, silentmutations were introduced around codons 290 and 501 to form AflII and HindIII digestsites. For BM48-31 spike, silent mutations were introduced around codons 295 and 501to form AflII and HindIII digest sites. These engineered spike sequences weresynthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ (GenScript).Spike RBDs were first codon-optimized for human cells, appended with regions ofthe target spike backbone to facilitate Infusion cloning and synthesized as doublestranded DNA fragments (IDT DNA). SARS-CoV, As6526 or BM48-31 engineered spikeplasmids were digested with their corresponding restriction enzymes and gel purified.RBD inserts were resuspended in water and Infusion cloned into gel purified, digestedspike backbone vectors (Takara).Human ACE2 (Q9BYF1.2), DPP4 (XM_005246371.3), or APN (NP_001141.2)were synthesized and cloned into pcDNA3.1+ (GenScript). All DNA constructs wereverified by Sanger sequencing (ACGT Inc.).post-transfection.BHK cells were seeded in black 96-well plates and transfected the next day with100ng plasmid DNA encoding human ACE2, DPP4, APN or empty vector, usingpolyethyleneimine (Polysciences). All downstream experiments were performed 24 hoursPseudotypes were produced as previously described18. 293T cells were seededonto 6-well plates pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and transfected the next day with1200ng empty plasmid and 400ng of plasmid encoding coronavirus spike or GFP as a nopseudotype control. Twenty-four hours later, transfected cells were infected with VSV\u0394Gparticles pseudotyped with VSV-g as previously described19. After one hour of incubatingat 37\u00b0C, cells were washed three times and incubated in 2mL DMEM supplemented with2% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine for 48 hours. Supernatants werecollected, centrifuged at 500xG for 5 minutes, aliquoted and stored at -80.Target cells were seeded in black 96-well plates and inoculated, in triplicate, withequivalent volumes of pseudotype stocks. For trypsin experiments, pseudotype stockswere diluted 1:1 in DMEM without FBS, trypsin was added to a final concentration of2500\u03bcg/mL and samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes. Samples were thendiluted again 1:1 in cold DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and added to cells. Inoculatedplates were centrifuged at 1200xG, 4\u00b0C, for 1 hour and incubated over night at 37\u00b0C.Approximately 18-20 hours post-infection, Bright-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega) wasadded to each well, 1:1, without removing culture media and luciferase was measured.Relative entry was calculated by normalizing the relative light unit (RLU) for spikepseudotypes to the plate RLU average for the \u201cno pseudotype control.\u201dProducer cells (spike-transfected 293T) were lysed in 1%SDS, 150mM NaCl,50mM Tris-HCl, 5mM EDTA and clarified by centrifugation at 14000xG for 20 minutes.Pseudotyped particles were concentrated from producer cell lysates that were overlaid a10% OptiPrep cushion in PBS (Sigma) and centrifuged at 20,000\u00d7 g for 2 hours at 4 \u00b0C.Lysates and concentrated particles were analyzed for FLAG, GAPDH and/or VSV-mexpression on 10% Bis-Tris PAGE gel (ThermoFisher).Accession numbers for all spike sequences used here can be found in figure s1b.The receptor binding domain (RBD) of lineage B \u03b2-CoVs is a single, continuousdomain that contains all structural information necessary to interact with the host receptor(figure 1a, b). We introduced silent mutations in the codon optimized coding sequence forSARS-CoV to facilitate replacing the SARS RBD with the RBD from other lineage Bviruses (figure 1b). All lineage B sequences were downloaded from online repositoriesand parsed to 29 unique RBD sequences, representing all published variations of thelineage B RBD (supp. fig 1a, b). The panel of 29 RBDs phylogenetically cluster into 3clades, as previously described5, but these RBD clades were not apparent in phylogeneticanalysis of other viral sequences, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (supp.fig 1c). All 29 RBDs were codon optimized, synthesized and cloned in place of the SARSRBD, effectively generating chimeric spike expression constructs. We then generatedVSV-luciferase reporter particles pseudotyped with the chimeric spikes (figure 1c). Wechose VSV over lentiviruses as our pseudotype platform because a lentiviral pseudotypeshave failed to accurately reflect viral entry with novel bat coronavirus spike protein7. Allconstructs exhibited similar levels of expression in producer cells and incorporation intoVSV pseudotypes, except the chimera with BM48-31 which displayed somewhat reducedexpression compared to WT SARS spike (figure 1d). We then infected BHK cellsexpressing the receptor for SARS-CoV or empty vector (figure 1e) and observed onlyclade 1, which includes SARS-CoV, WIV1 and SHC014, could enter cells transfected withhuman ACE2 (figure 1e).After binding the host receptor, host-cell protease cleaves spike, releasing thefusion peptide and allowing for host cell entry 20. Previous studies have shown thatabsence of the host protease or incompatibility between the host protease and viral spikecan block viral entry 21-24. To circumvent host-cell protease incompatibility or absence, wetreated our lineage B pseudotype panel and infected a wide variety of cell types fromdifferent host species (figure 2, supp. fig. 2). In the absence of exogenous protease, onlyclade 1 infected cells from African green monkey kidney, human gastrointestinal tract,human liver, and porcine kidney, in agreement with previous studies (figure 2; supp. fig.2a, b). Surprisingly, exogenous protease enhanced entry of a subset of clade 2 spikechimeras in nonhuman primate, bat and human cells (figure 2). Importantly, VSV-gpseudotyped particles were able to produce luciferase signal in all cell lines tested in thisstudy (supp. fig. 2c).We next tested human variants of known \u03b2-CoV receptors for their ability tomediate cell entry of clade 2 and 3 spike chimeras. We also tested humanaminopeptidase N (APN), a receptor for alphacoronaviruses, which have been shown toutilize either human ACE2 or human APN for cell entry (figure 3a). Protease treatmentonly enhanced entry of clade 1 RBDs on cells expressing human ACE2, but not humanDPP4 or APN. No entry was observed with clade 2 or 3 spikes, regardless of receptor orprotease addition. Human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), the receptor for the lineage C\u03b2-CoVs, MERS-CoV, only mediated entry of MERS-CoV (figure 2b, middle panels).Importantly, in the absence of receptor, no entry was observed for any of thepseudotypes, suggesting that protease-mediated entry is receptor-dependent (figure 2b,right panels).While our study was ongoing, a novel lineage B virus tentatively named2019nCoV was identified as the cause of a pneumonia outbreak in Hubei, China. Once thesequence was publicly available, we synthesized, cloned and tested the RBD from2019nCoV in our assay with human variants of known coronavirus receptors. The chimericSARS-2019-nCoV spike protein expressed and was incorporated into particles similarlyto other clade 1 chimeric spikes (figure 3c). The 2019-nCoV RBD was capable of enteringcells expressing human ACE2, but not any of the other receptors tested (figure 3d; s3).Consensus sequences of the three lineage B clades showed several keydifferences between these groups. Only clade 1 RBDs contain all 14 residues that havebeen shown through crystallography, to interact with human ACE2 (figure 4a; s4). Themajority of these residues are absent from clades 2 and 3, which contain additionaldeletions in surface exposed loops that cluster at the interface with ACE2 (figure 4 a, b).We generated a series of clade consensus RBD variants to determine the minimumnumber of mutations needed to impart ACE2 function on clade 2 and 3 RBDs (figure 4c).Introducing the two loop deletions from clade 1 in clade 2 results in a reduced spikeexpression, impaired pseudotype incorporation and loss of cell entry (figure 4c, d).Restoring these loops in clade 2 and 3 from the loops found in clade 1 did not enhanceentry with ACE2 (figure 4c; 2\u21921 and 3\u21921 version 1). Introducing all 14 ACE2 contactpoints in clade 2 or 3 also failed to restore ACE2 entry (figure 4c; 2\u21921 and 3\u21921 version2). Only replacing all 14 contact points and the surrounding amino acids (also known asthe receptor binding motif, RBM) lead to increased ACE2 entry with clade 2 and 3 RBDs(figure 4c; 2\u21921 version 3 = clade 2 residues 322-400 + clade 1 residues 400-501; 3\u21921version 3 = clade 3 residues 322-385 + clade 1 residues 386-501). Taken together, theseresults show that the entire RBM from clade 1 is needed for ACE2 entry.We next synthesized full-length clade 2 and 3 spikes to compare to our RBDchimeras. We selected the clade 2 spike, As6526, because it consistently gave strongentry signal in human cells following protease-treatment (figure 2b) as well as BM48-31,the only clade 3 spike in our panel. As we did for SARS-CoV spike, clade 2 and 3 spikeswere codon optimized, FLAG-tagged and silent mutations were introduced to facilitatereplacing their RBD with the consensus RBD from clade 1 (figure 5a). All chimericconstructs expressed similarly, with the exception for the SARS-BM48-31 RBD chimera,which exhibited reduced expression and incorporation (figure 5b). Protease treatmentenhanced entry of both the As6526 clade 2 RBD chimera and full-length spike entry intoHuh cells (figure 5c). Protease treatment had no effect on either the BM48-31 clade 3chimera or full-length spike (figure 5c). Taken together, these findings show thatSARSlineage B RBD chimeras reflect the entry phenotype of full-length lineage B spikes.Finally, we tested if receptor-binding and protease processing are coupled. Wereplaced the RBD of full-length clade 2 and 3 spike with the consensus RBD from clade1 and tested pseudotypes on cells expressing the clade 1 receptor. The clade 1consensus RBD efficiently facilitated entry of both As6526 and BM48-31 spike onlyfollowing protease treatment. These findings show that even though BHK-hACE2 cellssupport full-length clade 1 spike entry, just having the RBD from a clade 1 virus isinsufficient to mediate entry. As seen in our previous experiments, protease treatment didnot enhance pseudotype entry in the absence of host receptor (figure 5).Despite significant advances in next generation sequencing technologies, whichhave facilitated the discovery of thousands of novel animal-derived viruses, tools fordownstream functional assessment of these novel sequences are lacking. To gaintraction on this ever-growing problem, we took a reductionist approach to coronavirusentry and developed a scalable, BSL2-compatible method for testing only the minimalregion of the virus essential for interacting with the host receptor (figure 1, figure s1a).Because most of these viruses have never been isolated, we resorted to synthetic biologyand molecular engineering to reduce the burden of gene synthesis to just a smallfragment. Thus, the cost and synthesis production time for testing several spikes for entryin our system is dramatically reduced (figure s1d). In theory, this approach to functionalviromics should be applicable to a wide variety of virus-host proteins and interactions.Coronavirus entry is a multi-step process involving multiple, distinct domains inspike that mediate virus attachment to the cell surface, receptor engagement, proteaseprocessing and membrane fusion8. While the RBD:receptor interaction is most studied inthis process, recent studies have highlighted the major role host protease processingplays as a species barrier22,25-27. Lineage C coronaviruses include MERS-CoV as well asdistantly related viruses such as HKU4, HKU5 and PDF-2180 28,29. Studies have shownthat HKU4 can bind human DPP4 but requires addition of exogenous trypsin to facilitatecell entry and that HKU5 and PDF-2180 spikes can enter human cells through anunidentified receptor with protease treatment22,26. Analogous to these earlier studies oflineage C CoVs, we observed protease-enhanced entry of lineage B CoVs (figure 2, 3,5). While it has been shown that host proteases cleave spike, allowing for downstreammembrane fusion, other evidence suggests that protease may act on the receptor as wellto activate it30. Addition of protease during the course of SARS-CoV infection facilitatedentry in cells with low-expression of ACE2 that is normally insufficient to support virusentry30. Indeed, we saw evidence of residual trypsin activity on the cells after infection inour studies as the cell monolayer was loose compared to the untreated condition.Similarly, Menachery et al. also observed cell rounding during their trypsin infections26.Therefore, further studies are needed to assess where trypsin is enhancing entry ofcoronaviruses: at the level of spike, the receptor, or both.In the absence of exogenous protease, only clade 1 RBDs entered nonhumanprimate, human and porcine cell lines (figure 2a, b, s2a, b). These findings are in strongagreement with previous studies that have either isolated virus (WIV1) or rescuedrecombinant chimeric viruses (SHC014, Rs4231, Rs7237)5,7,31. However, with trypsin, asubset of genetically-similar clade 2 RBDs gained entry in these cells, suggesting theirbarrier is at the level of protease processing (figure 2a, b). The other spike from clade 2and 3 did not enter the cells we tested, regardless of protease addition, suggesting anabsent or incompatible receptor. Surprisingly, the protease-dependent entry phenotypewas consistent in the reverse spike chimeras in which we replaced the RBD in clade 2 or3 spike with a clade 1 RBD (figure 5d), suggesting that either the protease site betweenS1/S2 is not compatible with the chimeric spike backbone or the protease is notexpressed in these cells (figure s5). Because clade 1 spikes enter cells expressing humanACE2 without addition of protease but clade2-clade1 chimeras require protease, our datasuggests the spike protease cleavage site is adapted to the protease environment of thereceptor-bound RBD (figure s5).None of the spike pseudotypes efficiently entered Rhinolophus cells, which has beenobserved in previous studies using these cells32,33 (figure 2c). Surprisingly, AJi cells wereselectively permissive for only clade 2 entry following protease treatment, which suggeststhat clade 2 RBDs interact with a receptor that is distinct from clade 1 (figure 2c).Our results show that, despite all being classified as the same virus species, mostlineage B \u03b2-CoVs do not use currently known coronavirus receptors (figure 1e, 3a, b).Critically, we did not observe any pseudotype entry in the presence of protease andabsence of receptor, suggesting that lineage B cell entry is still receptor-dependentfollowing protease treatment (figure 3b). While our study was ongoing, a novel lineage B\u03b2-CoV was identified as the etiological agent behind an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan,Hubei, China (2019-nCoV). The RBD for 2019-nCoV has residues and motifs found in all3 clades but forms a distinct clade, so we tested it for receptor usage and observed entryonly with human ACE2 but not other known coronavirus receptors (figure 3d).Interestingly, within the backbone of SARS-CoV spike, cell entry of 2019-nCoV wassimilar to the other clade 1 spikes tested, including SARS-CoV. These finding suggests2019-nCoV is capable of using human ACE2 as efficiently as SARS-CoV, which may helpexplain the human-to-human transmissibility of this virus. More studies are needed withthe full spike sequence and, ideally, a viral isolate.The receptor binding motif (RBM) is a small region in the C-terminal half of the RBDand contains all the residues that interface with the host receptor (figure 3a)15. The 14contact points in the co-structure of the SARS-RBD bound to human ACE2 are largelyabsent from clade 2 and 3 RBDs, which also contain deletions compared to clade 1 RBMs(figure 4a, b, s4a). Simply mutating clade 2 and 3 to have the 14 contact points wasinsufficient to impart human ACE2 usage (figure 4c). This is likely because thenoncontact residues in the RBM play a supportive and structural role for these contact points,and indeed, these non-contact residues are different between the clades (figure s4).In contrast to changing individual amino acids, our chimeric RBD constructs show thatclade 2 and 3 RBD containing the clade 1 RBM are compatible with human ACE2.Coronaviruses frequently undergo recombination, gaining large swaths of geneticmaterial at once 34,35. Taken together with our data, it is possible that recombination witha clade 1 virus will impart compatibility with human ACE2. Interestingly, the 2019-nCoVRBD forms a clade that is distinct from the other 3 clades (figure s1c). However, the2019nCoV RBD contains most of the contact points with human ACE2 that are found in clade1 as well as some amino acid variations that are unique to clade 2 and 3 (figure s4b).Taken together with our receptor assay results, it may be possible that 2019-nCoV arosefrom recombination between clade 1 and the other clades.As we saw with the SARS-As6526 RBD (clade 2) spike chimera, full length As6526spike entered cells following protease treatment, but BM48-31 (clade 3) spike did not(figure 2, 5c). These data show that the chimeric spikes generally reproduce the entryphenotypes of full-length spikes. Notably, the full length As6526 spike did not enter cellsas efficiently as the SARS-As6526 chimera, suggesting that other human-cell adaptationsare likely needed in As6526 spike.The capacity to predict the zoonotic potential of newly detected viruses has beenseverely hindered by a lack of functional data for these novel animal virus sequences.Here, we have developed a rapid and cost-effective platform to functionally test largegroups of related viruses for zoonotic potential. We found that several other lineage Bcoronaviruses are capable of entering human cells through an unknown receptor and thatlineage B spike proteins can recombine to gain entry with a known host-receptor. Takentogether with the latest outbreak of 2019-nCoV in humans, these findings underscore theimportance of continued surveillance of coronaviruses at the sequence and functionallevels in order to better prepare for the next emerging virus.We would like to thank Dr. Anthony Schountz for generously sharing primary artibeuscells, as well as Dr. Marcel Muller for providing the Rhinolophus cells used in this study.We would also like to acknowledge Wu,F., Zhao,S., Yu,B., Chen,Y.-M., Wang,W., Hu,Y.,Song,Z.-G., Tao,Z.-W., Tian,J.-H., Pei,Y.-Y., Yuan,M.L., Zhang,Y.-L., Dai,F.-H., Liu,Y.,Wang,Q.-M., Zheng,J.-J., Xu,L., Holmes,E.C. and Zhang,Y.-Z, the Wuhan Institute ofVirology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College,Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospitar forproviding the genome sequence for 2019-nCoV and other essential outbreak informationto the scientific community.

Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for theirability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonoticviral outbreak. At the same time, improvements in next generation sequencingtechnology lead to a boom of virus discovery, uncovering thousands of novel virussequences in wild animal populations around the world. However, there is amassive knowledge gap in the field as very little work is performed after the viralsequences are published. Therefore, it is unknown whether these novel viruses have thepotential to emerge in human populations. Current methods for studying novel \u03b2-CoVs are technically demanding. RaKSM-2.5 primary cellshave been previously described and were immortalized in this study similar to AJi cells17.The spike coding sequences for SARS-CoV Urbani, As6526, and BM48-31 werecodon optimized for human cells, appended with a 5\u2019 kozak expression sequence(GCCACC) and 3\u2019 tetra-glycine linker followed by nucleotides encoding a FLAG tagsequence (DYKDDDDK). For As6526 spike, silentmutations were introduced around codons 290 and 501 to form AflII and HindIII digestsites. All downstream experiments were performed 24 hoursPseudotypes were produced as previously described18. Twenty-four hours later, transfected cells were infected with VSV\u0394Gparticles pseudotyped with VSV-g as previously described19. Samples were thendiluted again 1:1 in cold DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and added to cells. Inoculatedplates were centrifuged at 1200xG, 4\u00b0C, for 1 hour and incubated over night at 37\u00b0C.Approximately 18-20 hours post-infection, Bright-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega) wasadded to each well, 1:1, without removing culture media and luciferase was measured. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of lineage B \u03b2-CoVs is a single, continuousdomain that contains all structural information necessary to interact with the host receptor(figure 1a, b). We introduced silent mutations in the codon optimized coding sequence forSARS-CoV to facilitate replacing the SARS RBD with the RBD from other lineage Bviruses (figure 1b). Protease treatmentonly enhanced entry of clade 1 RBDs on cells expressing human ACE2, but not humanDPP4 or APN. All chimericconstructs expressed similarly, with the exception for the SARS-BM48-31 RBD chimera,which exhibited reduced expression and incorporation (figure 5b). Protease treatment had no effect on either the BM48-31 clade 3chimera or full-length spike (figure 5c). Finally, we tested if receptor-binding and protease processing are coupled. The clade 1consensus RBD efficiently facilitated entry of both As6526 and BM48-31 spike onlyfollowing protease treatment. In theory, this approach to functionalviromics should be applicable to a wide variety of virus-host proteins and interactions. Addition of protease during the course of SARS-CoV infection facilitatedentry in cells with low-expression of ACE2 that is normally insufficient to support virusentry30. More studies are needed withthe full spike sequence and, ideally, a viral isolate. However, the2019nCoV RBD contains most of the contact points with human ACE2 that are found in clade1 as well as some amino acid variations that are unique to clade 2 and 3 (figure s4b).Taken together with our receptor assay results, it may be possible that 2019-nCoV arosefrom recombination between clade 1 and the other clades.
