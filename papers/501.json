The mainstay of clinicalmanagement is largely symptomatictreatment, with organ support inintensive care for seriously ill patients.The unprecedented flurry of activityby WHO and other global publichealth bodies has mainly focused onpreventing transmission, infectioncontrol measures, and screening oftravellers. The development of vaccineshas received immediate funding;however, as with SARS-CoV andMERSCoV, support for developing treatmentsfor 2019-nCoV that reduce mortalityhas not been forthcoming. There is anurgent need for focusing funding andscientific investments into advancingnovel therapeutic interventions forcoronavirus infections.All three coronaviruses induceexcessive and aberrant non-effectivehost immune responses that areassociated with severe lung pathology,leading to death.2\u20134 Similar to patientswith SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, somepatients with 2019-nCoV developacute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) with characteristic pulmonaryground glass changes on imaging. Inmost moribund patients, 2019-nCoVinfection is also associated with acytokine storm, which is characterisedby increased plasma concentrationsof interleukins 2, 7, and 10,granulocyte-colony stimulating factor,interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10,monocyte chemoattractant protein 1,macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1.2\u20136In those who survive intensive care,these aberrant and excessive immuneresponses lead to long-term lungdamage and bfirosis, causing functionaldisability and reduced quality of life.7,8Specific drugs to treat 2019-nCoVwill take several years to develop andevaluate. In the meantime, a rangeof existing host-directed therapiesthat have proven to be safe9\u201311could potentially be repurposed totreat 2019-nCoV infection. Severalmarketed drugs with excellent safetyprofiles such as metformin, glitazones,bifrates, sartans, and atorvastin, as wellas nutrient supplements and biologicscould reduce immunopathology,boost immune responses, and preventor curb ARDS.9\u201311 Zinc and othermetalcontaining formulations appear tohave anti-viral activity,12 are safe,cheap, and readily available. Theseformulations could be used as adjunctsto monotherapy or as combinationaltherapies with cyclosporine, lopinavir\u2013ritonavir, interferon beta-1b,ribavirin, remdesivir, monoclonalantibodies, and anti-viral peptidestargeting 2019-nCoV.11 Tocilizumab,a monoclonal antibody that targetsthe interleukin 6 receptor, has agood safety profile. Monoclonal andpolyclonal antibodies to 2019-nCoVcould be developed for post-exposureprophylaxis.Ongoing trials of cellular therapiesfor treatment of ARDS could beexpanded to treatment of seriously illpatients with 2019-nCoV infection.Cellular therapy,13 using mesenchymalstromal cells from allogeneic donors,has been shown to reducenonproductive inflammation and affecttissue regeneration and is beingevaluated in phase 1/2 trials inpatients with ARDS (NCT02804945;NCT03608592). Infection with2019-nCoV appears to be initiallyassociated with an increased Th2response,4 which might reflect aphysiological reaction to curb overtinflammatory responses, a clinicalphenomenon that guided the optimaltiming of interferon treatment inpatients with sepsis, resulting inincreased survival.14 Interleukin 17 Published Onlineblockade might benefit those patients February 5, 2020who have a 2019-nCoV infection and Sh0tt1p4s0:/-/6d7o3i.6or(g2/01)03.01300156-/6increased plasma concentration ofinterleukin 17.The isolation and short-termexpansion of anti-viral directedT cells has been proven to be alifesaving procedure in patients afterautologous hematopoietic stem-celltransplantation with cytomegalovirusinfection.15 Expansion ofanti-2019nCoV-specific T cells, as cellular drugs,could aid to prepare T-cell products forthe adjunct treatment of patients withsevere 2019-nCoV infection.Several unique opportunities toevaluate a range of treatmentinterventions at the peak of the SARS-CoVand MERS-CoV outbreaks weremissed due to avoidable delays andsubsequent decline of the numbersof cases, leaving numerous questionsabout coronavirus pathogenesisunanswered. Disappointingly,treatment trials registered for MERS-CoVare still not complete. As the2019-nCoV continues to spread andevolve, and the numbers of deathsrise exponentially, advancing newtherapeutic development becomescrucial to minimise the number ofdeaths from 2019-nCoV infection.We declare no competing interests.
