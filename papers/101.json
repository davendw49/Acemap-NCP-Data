With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u03b3), we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals(SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the trueunknown SI.Findings: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R0ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10) associated with 0-fold to 2-fold increase inthe reporting rate. With rising report rate, the mean R0 is likely to be below 5 but above 3.Conclusion: The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47(95%CI: 4.16-7.10), and significantly larger than 1.

By the end of January 22, 2020, there have been 571 confirmedcases of 2019-nCoV infections in mainland China, including 17 deaths [2]. The 2019-nCoV cases were alsoreported in Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US, and all these cases wereexported from China, see WHO news release https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ from January 14-21. Theoutbreak is still on-going. A recently published preprint by Imai et al. estimated that a total of 1723 (95%CI:427-4471) cases of nCoV infections in Wuhan had onset of symptoms by January 12, 2020 [3]. The likelihoodof travel related risks of disease spreading is suggested by [4], which indicates the potentials of regional andTo the best of our knowledge, there is no existing peer-reviewed literature quantifying the transmissibility of2019-nCoV as of January 22, 2020. In this study, we estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV via thebasic reproduction number, R0, based on the limited data in the early phase of the outbreak.We obtained the number of 2019-nCoV cases time series data in mainland China released by WuhanMunicipal Health Commission, China and National Health Commission of China from January 10 to January22, 2020 from [6]. All cases were laboratory confirmed following the case definition by national healthcommission of China [7].Although there were cases confirmed on or before January 16, the official diagnostic protocol was released byWHO on January 17 [8]. To adjust the impact of this event, we considered a time-varying reporting rate thatfollows a linear increasing trend, motivated by the previous study [9]. We assumed that the reporting rate, r(t),started increasing since January 17, and stopped at the maximal level at January 20. Denoting the dailyreported number of new cases by c(t) for the t-th day, then the adjusted cumulative number of cases, C(t), is ( ) = \u2211 =0  ( )/ ( ). Instead of finding the exact value of r(t), we calculated the fold change in r(t) that isdefined by the ratio of r on January 10 over that on January 22 minus 1. We considered four scenarios forfurther analysis with 0-fold (no change), 0.5-fold, 1-fold and 2-fold increase in reporting rate, see Fig 1(a), (c),(e) and (g).Following previous studies [10, 11], we modelled the epidemic curve obeying the exponential growth. Thenonlinear least square (NLS) framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. The intrinsicgrowth rate (\u03b3) of the exponential growth was estimated, and the basic reproduction number could be obtainedby R0 = 1/M(\u2212\u03b3) with 100% susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at this early stage. The function M(\u2219) is the Laplacetransform, i.e., the moment generating function, of the probability distribution for the serial interval (SI) of thedisease [10, 12], denoted by h(k) and k is the mean SI. Since the transmission chain of 2019-nCoV remainsunclear, we adopted the SI information from other well-known coronavirus diseases, i.e., the middle eastrespiratory syndrome (MERS), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which share the similarpathogen as 2019-nCoV. We modelled h(k) as Gamma distributions with mean of 7.6 days and standarddeviation (SD) of 3.4 days for MERS [13], and mean of 8.4 days and SD of 3.8 days for SARS [14] as well astheir average, see the row heads in Table 1 for each scenario.The exponential growth fitting results are shown in Fig 1(b), (d), (f) and (h). The coefficient of determination,R-squared, ranges from 0.86 to 0.87 for all reporting rate changing scenarios, which implies that the earlyoutbreak data were largely following the exponential growth. In Table1, we estimated that the R0 ranges from3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10) associated with 0-fold to 2-fold increase in the reportingrate. All R0 estimates are significantly larger than 1, which indicates the potential of 2019-nCoV to causeoutbreaks. Since the official diagnostic protocol was released by WHO on January 17 [8], an increase in thediagnosis and reporting of 2019-nCoV infections probably occurred. Thereafter, the daily number of newlyreported cases started increasing around January 17, see Fig 1, which implies that more infections were likelybeing diagnosed and recorded. We suggested that changing in reporting might exist thus should be consideredin estimation. Although four scenarios about the reporting rate were explored in this study, the real situation isdifficult to determine given limited data and (almost) equivalent model fitting performance in terms ofRsquared. However, with the rising in the reporting rate, we found the mean R0 is likely to be below 5 but above3.Our analysis and estimation of R0 rely on the accuracy of the SI of 2019-nCoV, which remains unknown as ofJanuary 21. In this work, we employed the SIs of SARS and MERS as approximations to that of 2019-nCoV.The determination of SI requires the knowledge of the chain of disease transmission that needs sufficientnumber of patient samples and periods of time for follow-up [15], and thus this is unlikely to be achievedshortly. However, using SIs of SARS and MERS as approximation could provide an insight to thetransmission potential of 2019-nCoV at the early stage of the outbreak. We reported that the mean R0 of2019nCoV is likely to be from 3.3 to 5.5, and it appeared (slightly) higher than those of SARS, i.e., 2-5 [14, 16],and MERS, i.e., 2.7-3.9 [17]. Furthermore, measures on \u2018entry, exit and travel\u2019 screening and restrictionstarted today (on January 23) in Wuhan is likely to reduce the R0, which is benefit for the 2019-nCoV controland prevention.We estimated the mean R0 of 2019-nCoV ranging from 3.30 (95%CI: 2.73-3.96) to 5.47 (95%CI: 4.16-7.10)and being 3.98 (95%CI: 3.19-4.92) if the reporting efforts doubled after the diagnostic protocol released onJanuary 17, 2020.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.'Pneumonia of unknown cause \u2013 China', Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease outbreaknews, World Health Organization (WHO)[https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/]'Situation report of the pneumonia cases caused by the novel coronavirus', released on January22, 2020 by the National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China (in Chinese).[http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/202001/a3c8b5144067417889d8760254b1a7ca.shtml]Imai N, Dorigatti I, Cori A, Riley S, Ferguson NM: Estimating the potential total number of novelCoronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases in Wuhan City, China.
