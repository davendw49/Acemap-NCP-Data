According to a recent reportin Nature,2 at least 54 academic papersabout COVID-19 were publishedin English-language journals byJan 30, 2020.We searched major Chinesedatabases including the China NationalKnowledge Internet and WANFANGData. As of Feb 3, 2020, just 23Chineselanguage papers on COVID-19 werepublished. These publications mainlyfocused on epidemiology, clinicalfeatures of COVID-19, and the structureor genetics of severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Many of the research papers aboutCOVID-19 in international journalswere written by researchers in China,which led to great concerns becausethese findings cannot directlybenefit frontline health professionalsand policy makers because of thelanguage barrier. It is critical forhealth science to be published inEnglish-language journals to facilitatecommunication and enable globalcoordination and timely epidemicresponse. However, some media wereconcerned that Chinese researcherswithin academic organisationsconcentrated on publishing papersin prestigious international journalsbut paid inadequate attention toepidemic prevention of COVID-19and neglected to disseminate theirfindings within Chinese-languagejournals.3,4 A recent statement by theMinistry of Science and Technologyof China also encouraged researchersto focus their efforts on epidemicprevention and to publish their resultsin Chinese.5The emphasis on publishing clinicalresearch in English helps to facilitateknowledge exchange between Chinesescientists and the rest of the world.We hope the research communitywill make efforts to disseminate allifndings relevant to the outbreak ofCOVID-19 in Chinese in addition toEnglish publishing outlets.For example, clinical research papersabout COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 inany Lancet journal were translated intoChinese, and these translated Articleswere provided rapidly to the public inChina free of charge.Broad dissemination in both Chineseand English will accomplish the goalsof communicating timely and crucialifndings to the international scientificcommunity, while also disseminatingthis information to health-care workerson the frontline who need tounderstand the epidemiological and clinicalfeatures of COVID-19. This strategy willimprove effective control strategiesto ultimately contain the virus andprotect the health of the public.We declare no competing interests.

Morerecently, outbreaks of the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus, in2002, and the Middle East respiratorysyndrome coronavirus, in 2012, havebeen characterised byhuman-tohuman transmission and highincidence of acute respiratory failure. Thegrowing alarm for the novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) spreading from Chinabrings back the spectre of the rapidlydiufsing pandemics of the past. 2Non-invasive ventilation is anefective and common treatment forpatients with mild to moderate acuterespiratory failure.3 It is associated withmortality reduction compared to eitherspontaneous breathing or mechanicalventilation by endotracheal tube assupported by several randomised trials.4Emergency departments and intensivecare units are increasingly applyingnon-invasive ventilation.3 When usedto treat acute respiratory failure,noninvasive ventilation is applied to thepatient mainly by face mask or helmet.3Since coronavirus diffusion takesplace by droplet transmission,2aerosolisation during hospital procedureslike intubation or bronchoscopy mightrepresent a big concern, exposingother patients and health-care staf toan increased risk of infection, as duringthe flu pandemia.1 Aerosolisationwith nosocomial amplification of theinfection can also potentially happenaround the face mask duringnoninvasive ventilation, as demonstratedin different simulation studies.5Accordingly, the eficacy and safety ofnon-invasive ventilation during viralpandemic infection are still debated.However, during pandemics, thenumber of intensive care unit bedsfor mechanical ventilation throughtracheal intubation could rapidlybecome insufficient,1 whereasnoninvasive ventilation can be oefred alsooutside the intensive care unit.4To increase safety duringnon-invasive ventilation, use of a helmet as anon-invasive ventilation interface canbe considered to avoid aerosolisationwhen the helmet is connected tothe ventilator without air dispersionthrough a spring-valve; unfortunately,a helmet costs more than most facemasks. Accordingly, when facing apatient with acute respiratory failureof suspected viral nature (and, aboveall, during pandemics), we recommendthe adoption of helmets and avoidanceof face masks as the non-invasiveventilation interface. Moreover, wesuggest that manufacturers shoulddevelop cheap and safe non-invasiveventilation interfaces to be used duringviral pandemics.We declare no competing interests.5Hui DS, Chow BK, Ng SS, et al.
