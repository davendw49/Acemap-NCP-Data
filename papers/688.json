Developing a deep learning-based model for automatic COVID-19 detection on chest CT is helpful to counter the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. A weakly-supervised deep learning-based software system was developed using 3D CT volumes to detect COVID-19. For each patient, the lung region was segmented using a pre-trained UNet; then the segmented 3D lung region was fed into a 3D deep neural network to predict the probability of COVID-19 infectious. 499 CT volumes collected from Dec. 13, 2019, to Jan. 23, 2020, were used for training and 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were used for testing. The deep learning algorithm obtained 0.959 ROC AUC and 0.976 PR AUC. There was an operating point with 0.907 sensitivity and 0.911 specificity in the ROC curve. When using a probability threshold of 0.5 to classify COVID-positive and COVID-negative, the algorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901, a positive predictive value of 0.840 and a very high negative predictive value of 0.982. The algorithm took only 1.93 seconds to process a single patient's CT volume using a dedicated GPU. Our weaklysupervised deep learning model can accurately predict the COVID-19 infectious probability in chest CT volumes without the need for annotating the lesions for training. The easily-trained and highperformance deep learning algorithm provides a fast way to identify COVID-19 patients, which is beneficial to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. The developed deep learning software is available at https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection.", "text": "        Since Dec 2019, a large and increasing outbreak of a novel coronavirus was first emerging in Wuhan,Hubei province of China [                Even though real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been consideredas the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, the very limited supply and strict requirements forlaboratory environment would greatly delay accurate diagnosis of suspected patients, which has posedunprecedented challenges to prevent the spread of the infection, particularly at the center of the epidemicarea. In contrast with it, chest computed tomography (CT) is a faster and easier method for clinicaldiagnosis of COVID-19 by combining the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms and signs with their recent closecontact, travel history, and laboratory findings, which can make it possible for quick diagnosis as earlyas possible in the clinical practice. It is also effectively helpful to isolate infected patients timely andcontrol the epidemic, especially within the range of Wuhan, Hubei province. In a word, chest CT is akey component of the diagnostic procedure for suspected patients and its CT manifestations have beenemphasized in several recent reports [        In a word, accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases at the very early stage playsa crucial role in timely quarantine and medical treatment, which is also of great importance for patients\u2019prognosis, the control of this epidemic, and the public health security. But currently, a large numberof suspected patients need to undergo the chest CT scanning in Hubei province, which have caused atremendous burden to professional medical staffs, and their severe shortage is also a major challenge inthe current situation; moreover, radiologists\u2019 visual fatigue would heighten the potential risks of misseddiagnosis for some small lesions.        Deep learning, as the core technology of the rising artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years, hasbeen reported with significantly diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging for automatic detection of lungdiseases [        Patients This retrospective study was approved by Huazhong University of Science and Technologyethics committee, patient consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study.Between Dec. 13, 2019 to Feb. 6, 2020, we searched unenhanced chest CT scans of patients withsuspected COVID-19 from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) of radiologydepartment (Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology).Finally, 540 patients (mean age, 42.5 16.1 years; range, 3-81 years, male 226, female 314) wereenrolled into this study, including 313 patients (mean age, 50.7 14.7 years; range, 8-81 years; male 138,female 175) with clinical diagnosed COVID-19 (COVID-positive group) and 229 patients (mean age,31.2 10.0 years; range, 3-69 years; male 88, female 141) without COVID-19 (COVID-negative group).There was no significant difference in sex between the two groups ( 2=1.744; P=0.187), age inCOVIDpositive group significantly higher than that of COVID-negative group (t=17.09; P<0.001). The mainclinical symptoms for these patients were fever, cough, fatigue, and diarrhea. Of all the patients, twowere included by both groups due to the first and second follow-up CT scans. The first case (female,year 66) was diagnosed as COVID-19 negative on Jan 24, 2020, then changed into COVID-positive onFeb 6, 2020; the second case (female, year 23) was diagnosed as COVID-19 positive on Jan 24, 2020,then changed into COVID-negative on Feb 3, 2020. All the CT volumes scanned on and before Jan 23,2020, were assigned for deep learning training, and all the CT volumes scanned after Jan 23, 2020, wereassigned for deep learning testing.Image Acquisition The CT scanning of all the enrolled patients was performed on a gemstone CTscanner (GE Discovery CT750HD; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), and were positioned in aheadfirst supine position, with their bilateral arms raised and placed beside bilateral ears. All the patientsunderwent CT scans during the end-inspiration without the administration of contrast material. Relatedparameters for chest CT scanning were listed as follows: field of view (FOV), 36 cm; tube voltage,100 kV; tube current, 350 mA; noise index, 13; helical mode; section thickness, 5 mm; slice interval,5 mm; pitch, 1.375; collimation 64 0.625 mm; gantry rotation speed, 0.7 s; matrix, 512 512; thereconstruction slice thickness 1 mm with an interval of 0.8 mm; scan rage from apex to lung base; themediastinal window: window width of 200 HU with a window level of 35 HU, and the lung window:window width of 1500 HU with a window level of -700 HU.        Ground-truth Label In the latest diagnosis and treatment protocols of pneumonia caused by a novelcoronavirus (trial version 5) [        COVID-19 has been regarded as current standard for clinical diagnostic cases in severely affected areasonly in Hubei Province, indicating that chest CT is fundamental for COVID-19 identification of clinicallydiagnosed cases.Typical CT findings for COVID-19 are also listed: multifocal small patchy shadowing and interstitialabnormalities in the early stage, especially for the peripheral area of the bilateral lungs. In theprogressive period, the lesions could increase in range and in number; it could develop into multiple groundglass opacity (GGO) with further infiltration into the bilateral lungs. In severe cases, pulmonary diffuseconsolidation may occur and pleural effusion is rarely shown.The combination of epidemiologic features (travel or contact history), clinical signs and symptoms,chest CT, laboratory findings and real-time RT-PCR (if available) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testingis used for the final identification of COVID-19. The medical CT reports were acquired via theelectronic medical record of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science andTechnology. According to the CT reports, if a CT scan was COVID-positive, its ground-truth label was1; otherwise, the label was 0.++          The Proposed DeCoVNet We proposed a 3D deep convolutional neural Network to Detect COVID-19(DeCoVNet) from CT volumes. As shown in Fig. 1, DeCoVNet took a CT volume and its 3D lung maskas input. The 3D lung mask was generated by a pre-trained UNet [                    The 3D lung mask of an input chest CT volume helped to reduce background information and betterdetect COVID-19. Detecting the 3D lung mask was a well-studied issue. In this study, we trained asimple 2D UNet using the CT images in our training set. To obtain the ground-truth lung masks, wesegmented the lung regions using an unsupervised learning method [          Data Preprocessing and Data AugmentationPreprocessing of 2D UNet All the CT volumes were preprocessed in a unified manner before trainingthe 2D UNet for lung segmentation. First, the unit of measurement was converted to the HounsfieldUnit (HU) and the value was linearly normalized from 16-bit to 8-bit (i.e., 0-255) after determining thethreshold of a HU window (e.g., -1 200-600 HU). After that, all the CT volumes were resampled into asame spatial resolution (e.g., 368 368), by which the CT volumes could be aligned without the influenceof the cylindrical scanning bounds of CT scanners. This step was applied to the obtained ground-truthlung masks as well.Preprocessing of DeCoVNet For each CT volume, the lung masks produced by the trained UNet formeda mask volume, then the CT volume was concatenated with the mask volume to obtain a CT-Maskvolume. Finally, the CT-Mask volume was resampled into a fixed spatial resolution (e.g., 224 336)without changing the number of slices for DeCoVNet training and testing. The number of slices in thewhole dataset was 141 16 ranging from 73 to 250.Data Augmentation To avoid the overfitting problem since the number of training CT volumes waslimited, online data augmentation strategies were applied including random affine transformation andcolor jittering. The affine transformation was composed of rotation (0 10 ), horizontal and verticalCT Volumes\u2295UNetSuperviseLabeled training setTake the trained model Gruonusnudp-terruvtihsemdamskesthboydanAll CT volumesPre-trained UNetAll lung masksLung Mask VolumesTrain setTest setDeCoVNetTrained DeCoVNetSupervisetranslations (0% 10%), scaling (0% 20%) and shearing in the width dimension (0 10 ). The colorjittering adjusted brightness (0% 50%) and contrast (0% 30%). For each training sample, theparameters were randomly generated and the augmentation was identically applied for each slice in the sampledCT volume.            Training and Testing Procedures The DeCoVNet software was developed based on the PyTorchframework [            During the procedure of testing, data augmentation strategies were not applied. The trainedDeCoVNet took the preprocessed CT-Mask volume of each patient and output the COVID-positive probabilityas well as COVID-negative probability. Then the predicted probabilities of all patients and theircorresponding ground-truth labels were collected for statistical analysis.The cohort for studying the COVID-19 detection contained 630 CT scans collected from Dec 13,2019 to Feb 6, 2020. To simulate the process of applying the proposed DeCoVNet for clinicalcomputeraided diagnosis (i.e., prospective clinical trials), we used the 499 CT scans collected from Dec 13, 2019to Jan 23, 2020 for training and used the rest 131 CT volumes collected from Jan 24, 2020 to Feb. 06,2020 for testing. Of the training volumes, 15% were randomly selected for hyperparameter tuning duringthe training stage.Statistical Analysis COVID-19 detection results were reported and analyzed using receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. The area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) andthe area under the precision-recall curve (PR AUC) were calculated. Besides, multiple operating pointswere chosen on the ROC curve, e.g., the points with approximately 0.95 sensitivity (high sensitivitypoint) and with approximately 0.95 specificity (high specificity point). ROC AUC, PR AUC, and somekey operating points were used to assess the deep learning algorithm.Patient and Public Involvement This was a retrospective case series study and no patients wereinvolved in the study design, setting the research questions, or the outcome measures directly. No patientswere asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.3Experimental results1.00.8ytiitv0.6isnes/llca0.4eR0.0PR AUC=0.9750.20.40.60.81.0PrecisionThe software for COVID-19 detection with the pre-trained model as well as the results was availableat https://github.com/sydney0zq/covid-19-detection, which will be made publiclyavailable on the publication of this paper. Training DeCoVNet on the training set which consisted of499 CT volumes took about 20 hours (11 hours for UNet and 9 hours for DeCoVNet) and testing a CTvolume costed an average of 1.93 seconds (1.80 seconds for UNet and 0.13 seconds for DeCoVNet) onan NVIDIA Titan Xp GPU.1.00.8)(%0.6ytivitisen0.4S0.20.0sensitivity = 0.947, specificity = 0.786sensitivity = 0.907, specificity = 0.911sensitivity = 0.880, specificity = 0.9460.00.20.4 0.61 - specificity (%)ROC AUC=0.9590.81.0For every testing CT scan, we used the trained DeCoVNet to predict its probability of COVID-19. Bycomparing with their binary ground-truth labels, we plotted ROC and PR curves as shown in Fig. 3 andFig. 4 respectively. In the ROC, we obtained a ROC AUC value of 0.959. When true positive rate (TPR,i.e., sensitivity) was approximately 0.95, our model obtained a true negative rate (TNR, i.e., specificity)of 0.786; when TNR was approximately 0.95, our model obtained a TPR of 0.880; there was anotheroperating showed that our algorithm obtained both TPR and FPR larger than 0.9, i.e., sensitivity=0.907and specificity=0.911. On the PR curve, our model obtained a PR AUC of 0.975.When using the threshold of 0.5 to make COVID-19 detection prediction (i.e., if the probabilityof COVID-19 was larger than 0.5, the patient was classified as COVID-positive, and vice versa), thealgorithm obtained an accuracy of 0.901 with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.840 and a negativepredictive value (NPV) of 0.982. By varying the probability threshold, we obtained a series of COVID-19detection accuracy, PPV and NPV in Table 2. Our data showed that the COVID-19 prediction accuracyobtained by the DeCoVNet algorithm was higher than 0.9 when the threshold ranged from 0.2 to 0.5. Atthe threshold setting of 0.5, there were 12 false positive predictions in total and only one false positiveprediction by the algorithm in our study, indicating that the algorithm to have a very high negativepredictive value.The accurate predictions (a true positive and a true negative) were presented in Fig. 5 (A-B), anderroneous predictions in Fig. 5 (C-F). In images corresponding to the true positive and the false negative,the lesions of COVID-19 were annotated by red arrows. As shown in Fig. 5 (C, D, E), the false negativepredictions were made by the algorithm, and Fig. 5 (F) showed the only false positive prediction, inwhich the respiratory artifact had been mistaken as a COVID-19 lesion by the DeCoVNet algorithm.Afalse negativesDtrue negativefalse positiveBENPV4To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform weakly-supervised computer-aided COVID-19detection with a large number of CT volumes from the frontline hospital at the present epidemic period. Bydesigning an effective weakly-supervised deep learning-based algorithm and training it on CT volumescollected before Jan 23, 2020 with only patient-level labels, the testing results on 131 CT scans collectedfrom Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were very impressive, e.g., the PR AUC value was 0.975. On theROC curve, the algorithm obtained sensitivity and specificity values larger than 0.9, which were bothclinically applicable.        The motivation of this study was to utilize AI to alleviate the problem of shortage of professionalinterpretations for CT images when the epidemic is still fast spreading. Though there were many effectiveapplications of medical AI in previous studies [                The deep learning-based COVID-19 diagnostic algorithm used in our study is effective compared torecent deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis methods. On the task of predicting the risk of lungcancer [                Our study provided a typical and successful solution for developing medical AI for emergingdiseases, such as COVID-19. While we were developing this AI, doctors in Wuhan were still extremelybusy with treating a huge number of COVID-19 patients and it may be impossible for them to annotatethe lesions in CT volumes in the current austere fight against this epidemic. Thanks to theweaklysupervised algorithm in this study, locations of pulmonary lesions in CT volumes are not necessary tobe annotated, and radiologists\u2019 annotating efforts can be minimized, i.e., only providing patient-levellabels. Therefore, developing a helpful AI tool swiftly has become possible and available in the clinicalapplication. In the future, the burden of AI experts could be lifted significantly by automatic machinelearning (AutoML) [        Limitations of this study There are still several limitations in this study. First, network design andtraining may be further improved. For example, the UNet model for lung segmentation did not utilizetemporal information and it was trained using imperfect ground-truth masks, which could be improvedby using 3D segmentation networks and adopting precise ground-truth annotated by experts. Second,the data used in this study came from a single hospital and cross-center validations were not performed.Third, when diagnosing COVID-19, the algorithm worked in a black-box manner, since the algorithmwas based on deep learning and its explainability was still at an early stage. Related work of alllimitations mentioned above will be addressed in our further studies.5In conclusion, without the need for annotating the COVID-19 lesions in CT volumes for training, ourweakly-supervised deep learning algorithm obtained strong COVID-19 detection performance.Therefore, our algorithm has great potential to be applied in clinical application for accurate and rapidCOVID19 diagnosis, which is of great help for the frontline medical staff and is also vital to control this epidemicworldwide.Contributors CZ, XD, QF and QZ contributed equally to this study and are considered as joint firstauthors.
