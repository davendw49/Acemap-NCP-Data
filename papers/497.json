Asophthalmologists, we believe thattransmission of 2019\u00ad nCoV throughthe eyes was ignored.On Jan 22, Guangfa Wang, amember of the national expert panelon pneumonia, reported that he wasinfected by 2019\u00ad nCoV during theinspection in Wuhan.2 He wore anN95 mask but did not wear anythingto protect his eyes. Several daysbefore the onset of pneumonia, Wangcomplained of redness of the eyes.Unprotected exposure of the eyes to2019\u00ad nCoV in the Wuhan Fever Clinicmight have allowed the virus to infectthe body.2Infectious droplets and body fluidscan easily contaminate the humanconjunctival epithelium.3 Respiratoryviruses are capable of inducing ocularcomplications in infected patients,which then leads to respiratoryinfection.4 Severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus (SARS\u00ad CoV) ispredominantly transmitted throughdirect or indirect contact with mucousmembranes in the eyes, mouth, ornose.5 The fact that exposed mucousmembranes and unprotected eyesincreased the risk of SARS\u00ad CoVtransmission4 suggests that exposureof unprotected eyes to 2019\u00ad nCoVcould cause acute respiratory infection.Thus, Huang and colleagues1should have analysed conjunctivalscrapings from both confirmed andsuspected 2019\u00ad nCoV cases during theonset of symptoms. The respiratorytract is probably not the onlytransmission route for 2019\u00ad nCoV,and all ophthalmologists examiningsuspected cases should wear protectiveeyewear.We declare no competing interests.", "ref_list": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "Chaolin Huang and colleagues1\nreported the epidemiology, symp\u00ad\ntoms, and treatment of patients\ninfected by the 2019 novel coronavirus\n(2019\u00ad nCoV) in Wuhan, China.
