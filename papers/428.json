The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARSCoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.", "text": "Uwhether the outbreak is caused by a new or a previouslypon a viral outbreak, it is important to rapidly establishknown virus (Box 1), as this helps decide which approachesand actions are most appropriate to detect the causative agent,control its transmission and limit potential consequences of theepidemic. The assessment of virus novelty also has implications forvirus naming and, on a different timescale, helps to define researchpriorities in virology and public health.For many human virus infections such as influenza virus1 ornorovirus2 infections, well-established and internationally approvedmethods, standards and procedures are in place to identify andname the causative agents of these infections and report thisinformation promptly to public health authorities and the general public.In outbreaks involving newly emerged viruses, the situation maybe different, and appropriate procedures to deal with these virusesneed to be established or refined with high priority.        Here, we present an assessment of the genetic relatedness of thenewly identified human coronavirus        Defining the novelty of viruses is one of the topics that virusclassification deals with. The classification of RNA viruses needs to*A list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper.consider their inherent genetic variability, which often results in twoor more viruses with non-identical but similar genome sequencesbeing regarded as variants of the same virus. This immediatelyposes the question of how much difference to an existing group islarge enough to recognize the candidate virus as a member of a new,distinct group. This question is answered in best practice byevaluating the degree of relatedness of the candidate virus to previouslyidentified viruses infecting the same host or establishedmonophyletic groups of viruses, often known as genotypes or clades, whichmay or may not include viruses of different hosts. This is formallyaddressed in the framework of the official classification of virustaxonomy and is overseen and coordinated by the ICTV4. Viruses areclustered in taxa in a hierarchical scheme of ranks in which thespecies represents the lowest and most populous rank containing theleast diverged groups (taxa) of viruses (Box\u00a02). The ICTV maintainsa Study Group for each virus family. The Study Groups areresponsible for assigning viruses to virus species and taxa of higher ranks,such as subgenera, genera and subfamilies. In this context they playan important role in advancing the virus species concept andhighlighting its significance5.Virus nomenclature is a formal system of names used to labelviruses and taxa. The fact that there are names for nearly all viruseswithin a species is due to the historical perception of viruses ascausative agents of specific diseases in specific hosts, and to the waywe usually catalogue and classify newly discovered viruses, whichincreasingly includes viruses that have not been linked to any knowndisease in their respective hosts (Box 1). The WHO, an agency of theUnited Nations, coordinates international public health activitiesaimed at combating, containing and mitigating the consequencesof communicable diseases\u2014including major virus epidemics\u2014andis responsible for naming disease(s) caused by newly emerginghuman viruses. In doing so, the WHO often takes the traditionalapproach of linking names of specific diseases to viruses (Box 1) andUnderstanding the cause of a specific disease that spreads amongindividuals of the same host species (infectivity) was the majordriving force for the discovery of the first virus in plants, andsubsequently many others in all forms of life, including humans.Historically, the range of diseases and hosts that specific virusesare associated with have been the two key characteristics usedto define viruses, given that they are invisible to the naked eye 46.Viral phenotypic features include those that, like a disease, arepredominantly shaped by virus\u2013host interactions includingtransmission rate or immune correlates of protection, and others that arelargely virus-specific, such as the architecture of virus particles.ehTse features are of critical importance to control, and respondto medically and economically important viruses \u2014 especiallyduring outbreaks of severe disease \u2014 and dominate the generalperception of viruses.However, the host of a given virus may be uncertain, and viruspathogenicity remains unknown for a major (and fast-growing)proportion of viruses, including many coronaviruses discoveredin metagenomics studies using next-generation sequencingtechnology of environmental samples47,48. eThse studies haveidentified huge numbers of viruses that circulate in nature andhave never been characterized at the phenotypic level. uThs, thegenome sequence is the only characteristic that is known forthe vast majority of viruses, and needs to be used in definingspecific viruses. In this framework, a virus is defined by a genomesequence that is capable of autonomous replication inside cellsand dissemination between cells or organisms under appropriateconditions. It may or may not be harmful to its natural host.Experimental studies may be performed for a fraction of knownviruses, while computational comparative genomics is used toclassify (and deduce characteristics of) all viruses. Accordingly,virus naming is not necessarily connected to disease but ratherinformed by other characteristics.In view of the above advancements and when confronted withthe question of whether the virus name for the newly identifiedhuman virus should be linked to the (incompletely defined) diseasethat this virus causes, or rather be established independently fromthe virus phenotype, the CSG decided to follow a phylogeny-basedline of reasoning to name this virus whose ontogeny can be tracedin the figure in Box 1.ICTVty CSGirohtuagnimaNMiddle East respiratorysyndrome-relatedcoronavirusSevere acute respiratorysyndrome-relatedcoronavirusMERS-CoVSARS-CoVSARS-CoV-2WHOMiddle East Severe acuterespiratory syndrome respiratory syndrome(MERS) (SARS)20122003First nameName origin            Coronavirusdisease 2019(COVID-            Apart from disease, geography and the organism from which agiven virus was isolated also dominate the nomenclature,occasionally engraving connections that may be accidental (rather thantypical) or even stigmatizing, which should be avoided. Establishing auniversal nomenclature for viruses was one of the major tasks ofthe ICTV when it was founded more than 50 years ago4. When thespecies rank was established in the taxonomy of viruses6, ICTV\u2019sresponsibility for naming viruses was shifted to naming andestablishing species. ICTV Study Groups may also be involved invirus naming on a case-by-case basis as an extension of theirofficial remit, as well as using the special expertise of their members.As virus species names are often very similar to the name of thefounding member of the respective species, they are frequentlyconfused in the literature with names of individual viruses in this species.The species name is italicized, starts with a capital letter and shouldnot be spelled in an abbreviated form7; hence the species name Severeacute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. In contrast, thisconvention does not apply to virus names, hence severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV, as it is widely known.Researchers studying coronaviruses\u2014a family of envelopedpositive-strand RNA viruses infecting vertebrates8\u2014have beenconfronted several times with the need to define whether a newlyemerged virus causing a severe or even life-threatening disease inhumans belongs to an existing or a new (yet-to-be-established)species. This happened with SARS9\u201312 and with Middle East respiratorysyndrome (MERS)13,14 a few years later. Each time, the virus wasplaced in the taxonomy using information derived from asequencebased family classification15,16.The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 speciesin 27 subgenera, five genera and two subfamilies that belong to thefamily Coronaviridae, suborder Cornidovirineae, order Nidoviralesand realm Riboviria17\u201319 (Fig.\u00a01). The family classification andtaxonomy are developed by the Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG), aworking group of the ICTV20. The CSG is responsible for assessingehT terms strain and isolate are commonly used to refer to virusvariants, although there are diefrent opinions as to which termshould be used in a specific context. If a candidate virus clusters within a known group of isolates, it is a variant of this groupand may be considered as belonging to this known virus group.In contrast, if the candidate virus is outside of known groups andits distances to viruses in these groups are comparable to thoseobserved between viruses of diefrent groups (intergroup distances),the candidate virus is distinct and can be considered novel.hTis evaluation is usually conducted in silico usingphylogenetic analysis, which may be complicated by unevenrates of evolution that vary across diefrent virus lineages andgenomic sites due to mutation, including the exchange ofgenome regions between closely related viruses (homologousrecombination). However, given that the current sampling ofviruses is small and highly biased toward viruses of significantmedical and economic interest, group composition variestremendously among diefrent viruses, making decisions onvirus novelty group-specific and dependent on the choice of thecriteria selected for this assessment.ehTse challenges are addressed in the framework of virustaxonomy, which partitions genomic variation above strain orisolate level and develops a unique taxon nomenclature underthe supervision of the ICTV4,5. To decide on whether a virusrepresents a new species\u2014that is, the least diverged (and mostpopulated) group of viruses\u2014taxonomists use the results ofdiefrent analyses. Taxonomical classification is hierarchical,using nested groups (taxa) that populate diefrent levels (ranks)of classification. Taxa of diefrent ranks diefr in their intra-taxonpairwise divergence, which increases from the smallest at thespecies rank to the largest at the realm rank30. eThy may also bedistinguished by taxon-specific markers that characterize naturalgroupings. Only the species and genus ranks need to be specifiedto classify a new virus; filling other ranks is optional. If a virusprototypes a new species, it will be regarded as taxonomicallynovel. If (within this framework) a virus crosses a host barrierand acquires novel properties, its classification will not change(that is, it remains part of the original species) even if the virusestablishes a permanent circulation in the new host, which likelyhappened with coronaviruses of the four species that circulatein humans and display seasonal peaks (reviewed in ref. 50).Importantly, the criteria used to define a viral species in onevirus family such as Coronaviridae may not be applicable toanother family such as Retroviridae, and vice versa, since StudyGroups are independent in their approach to virus classification.the place of new viruses through their relation to known viruses inestablished taxa, including placements relating to the species Severeacute respiratorysyndrome-related coronavirus. In the classificationof nidoviruses, species are considered biological entitiesdemarcated by a genetics-based method21, while generally virus species areperceived as man-made constructs22. To appreciate the differencebetween a nidoviral species and the viruses grouped therein, it maybe instructive to look at their relationship in the context of the fulltaxonomy structure of several coronaviruses. Although these viruseswere isolated at different times and locations from different humanand animal hosts (with and without causing clinical disease), theyall belong to the species Severe acute respiratorysyndrome-relatedcoronavirus, and their relationship parallels that between humanindividuals and the species Homo sapiens (Fig.\u00a01).Even without knowing anything about the species concept, everyhuman recognizes another human as a member of the same species.Initially, the classification of coronaviruses was largely based onserological (cross-) reactivities to the viral spike protein, but isnow based on comparative sequence analyses of replicativeproteins. eTh choice of proteins and the methods used to analysethem have gradually evolved since the start of this century20,28,29,51.ehT CSG currently analyses 3CLpro, NiRAN, RdRp, ZBD andHEL1 (ref. 52) (Fig.\u00a0 2a), two domains less than previously usedin the analyses conducted between 2009 and 2015 (refs. 16,18).According to our current knowledge, these vfie essential domains are the only ones conserved in all viruses of the orderNidovirales52. eThy are thus used for the classification by all ICTVnidovirus study groups (coordinated by the NSG).Since 2011, the classification of coronaviruses and othernidoviruses has been assisted by the DivErsity pArtitioningby hieRarchical Clustering (DEmARC) software, whichdefines taxa and ranks 23,24. Importantly, the involvement of allcoronavirus genome sequences available at the time of analysisallows family-wide designations of demarcation criteria for allranks, including species, regardless of the taxa sampling size,be it a single or hundreds of virus(es). DEmARC delineatesmonophyletic clusters (taxa) of viruses using weighted linkageclustering in the PPD space and according to the classification ofranks defined through clustering cost (CC) minima presented asPPD thresholds (PPD accounts for multiple substitutions at allsequence positions and thus may exceed 1.0, which is the limitfor conventional pair-wise distances (PDs)). In the DEmARCframework, the persistence of thresholds in the face of increasingvirus sampling is interpreted to reflect biological forces andenvironmental factors21. Homologous recombination, whichis common in coronaviruses53\u201355, is believed to be restricted ingenome regions encoding the most essential proteins, such asthose used for classification, and to members of the same virusspecies. This restriction promotes intra-species diversity andcontributes to inter-species separation. To facilitate the useof rank thresholds outside of the DEmARC framework, theyare converted into PD and expressed as a percentage, whichresearchers commonly use to arrive at a tentative assignmentof a given virus within the coronavirus taxonomy followingconventional phylogenetic analysis of selected viruses.However, for assigning individual living organisms to most otherspecies, specialized knowledge and tools for assessinginter-individual differences are required. The CSG uses a computationalframework of comparative genomics23, which is shared by several ICTVStudy Groups responsible for the classification and nomenclatureof the order Nidovirales and coordinated by the ICTV NidoviralesStudy Group (NSG)24 (Box\u00a0 3). The Study Groups quantify andpartition the variation in the most conserved replicative proteinsencoded in open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1a/1b) of thecoronavirus genome (Fig.\u00a02a) to identify thresholds on pair-wisepatristic distances (PPDs) that demarcate virus clusters at different ranks.Consistent with previous reports, SARS-CoV-2 clusters withSARS-CoVs in trees of the species Severe acute respiratorysyndrome-related coronavirus (Fig.\u00a02b) and the genus Betacoronavirus(Fig.\u00a02c)25\u201327. Distance estimates between SARS-CoV-2 and the mostclosely related coronaviruses vary among different studiesdepending on the choice of measure (nucleotide or amino acid) and genomeregion. Accordingly, there is no agreement yet on the exacttaxonomic position of SARS-CoV-2 within the subgenus Sarbecovirus.When we included SARS-CoV-2 in the dataset used for the mostrecent update (May 2019) of the coronavirus taxonomy currentlybeing considered by ICTV19, which includes 2,505 coronaviruses,RiboviriaNidoviralesCornidovirineaeCoronaviridaeOrthocoronavirinaeBetacoronavirusSarbecovirusFig. 1 | Taxonomy of selected coronaviruses. Shown is the full taxonomy of selected coronaviruses in comparison with the taxonomy of humans (thefounders of virology and other eminent scientists represent individual human beings for the sake of this comparison), which is given only for categories(ranks) that are shared with the virus taxonomy. Note that these two taxonomies were independently developed using completely different criteria.Although no equivalence is implied, the species of coronaviruses is interpreted sensu stricto as accepted for the species of humans.the species composition was not affected and the virus was assignedto the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,as detailed in Box\u00a04.With respect to novelty, SARS-CoV-2 differs from the two otherzoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, introducedto humans earlier in the twenty-first century. Previously, the CSGestablished that each of these two viruses prototype a new speciesin a new informal subgroup of the genus Betacoronavirus15,16. Thesetwo informal subgroups were recently recognized as subgeneraSarbecovirus and Merbecovirus18,28,29 when the subgenus rank wasestablished in the virus taxonomy30. Being the first identifiedrepresentatives of a new species, unique names were introduced for thetwo viruses and their taxa in line with the common practice and stateof virus taxonomy at the respective times of isolation. The situationwith SARS-CoV-2 is fundamentally different because this virus isassigned to an existing species that contains hundreds of knownviruses predominantly isolated from humans and diverse bats. Allthese viruses have names derived from SARS-CoV, although onlythe human isolates collected during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak havebeen confirmed to cause SARS in infected individuals. Thus, thereference to SARS in all these virus names (combined with the useof specific prefixes, suffixes and/or genome sequence IDs inpublic databases) acknowledges the phylogenetic (rather than clinicaldisease-based) grouping of the respective virus with the prototypicvirus in that species (SARS-CoV). The CSG chose the nameSARSCoV-2 based on the established practice for naming viruses in thisspecies and the relatively distant relationship of this virus to theprototype SARS-CoV in a species tree and the distance space (Fig.\u00a02band the figure in Box\u00a04).The available yet limited epidemiological and clinical data forSARS-CoV-2 suggest that the disease spectrum and transmissionefficiency of this virus31\u201335 differ from those reported forSARSCoV9. To accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentationsand outcomes of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 (ranging fromasymptomatic to severe or even fatal in some cases)31, the WHOrecently introduced a rather unspecific name (coronavirus disease19, also known as COVID-19 (ref. 36)) to denote this disease. Also,the diagnostic methods used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infections arenot identical to those of SARS-CoV. This is reflected by the specificrecommendations for public health practitioners, healthcareworkers and laboratory diagnostic staff for SARS-CoV-2 (for example,the WHO guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 37). By uncoupling thenaming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases thatsome of them cause in humans and animals, we wish to support theWHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the mostappropriate way (for further information, see the WHO\u2019s guidelines fordisease naming38). The further advancement of naming conventionsis also important because the ongoing discovery of new human andanimal viruses by next-generation sequencing technologies can beexpected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not(easily) fit the virus\u2013disease model that was widely used in thepregenomic era (Box 1). Having now established different names forthe causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease (COVID-19), theCSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general publicand public health authorities regarding the difference between thesetwo entities. The CSG promotes this clear distinction because it willhelp improve the outbreak management and also reduces the risk ofconfusing virus and disease, as has been the case over many yearswith SARS-CoV (the virus) and SARS (the disease).To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the CSGrecommends that researchers describing new viruses (that is, isolates)in this species adopt a standardized format for public databases andpublications that closely resembles the formats used for isolates ofavian coronaviruses39, filoviruses40 and influenza virus1. Theproposed naming convention includes a reference to the host organismthat the virus was isolated from, the place of isolation (geographiclocation), an isolate or strain number, and the time of isolation (yearor more detailed) in the format virus/host/location/isolate/date; forrpo rpo isysH iANR-4TBM -3L5AC -3L5BC -6TM 7 8 9 -01C -21Nsnp spn spn snp snp spn snp snp snp-sdp21pnRR -s31pnZBD-s311pnB -rcs3L11epnoEH -xs214onpAEN -s14pnTBNM -s115npA -sne15dpnoBNU -s16npTOMFJ588686.1SARS-CoV PC4\u2212227SARS-CoV\u221210+15d90% \u2264 SH70% \u2264 SH < 90%SH < 70%SARSr-CoV RaTG13SARS-CoV-2SARSr-CoV BtKY72ehT species demarcation threshold (also known as demarcationlimit) in the family Coronaviridae is denfied by viruses whosePPD(s) may cross the inter-species demarcation PPD threshold(threshold \u2018violators\u2019). Due to their minute share of ~10\u20134 of thetotal number of all intra- and inter-species PPDs, these violators maynot even be visually recognized in a conventional diagonal plotclustering viruses on a species basis (panel a of the gfiure in Box 4).Furthermore, they do not involve any virus of the species Severeacute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, as is evident fromthe analysis of maximal intraspecies PPDs of 2,505 viruses of all 49coronavirus species (of which 39 are established and 10 are pendingor tentative) (panel b of the gfiure in Box 4) and PDs of 256 virusesof this species (panel c of the gfiure in Box 4). uThs, the genomicvariation of the known viruses of the species Severe acute respiratorysyndrome-related coronavirus is smaller compared to that of othercomparably well-sampled species\u2014for example, those prototypedby MERS-CoV, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) andinfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (panel b of the gfiure in Box 4)\u2014andthis species is well separated from other known coronavirus speciesin the sequence space. Both of these characteristics facilitate theunambiguous assignment of SARS-CoV-2 to this species.Intra-species PDs of SARS-CoV-2 belong to the top 25% of thisspecies and also include the largest PD between SARS-CoV-2 andan African bat virus isolate (SARSr-CoV_BtKY72)56 (panel c ofthe figure in Box 4), representing two basal lineages within thespecies Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus thatconstitute very few known viruses (Fig.\u00a02b,c). eThse relationshipsstand in contrast to the shallow branching of the most populouslineage of this species, which includes all the human SARS-CoVisolates collected during the 2002\u20132003 outbreak and the closelyrelated bat viruses of Asian origin identified in the search for thepotential zoonotic source of that epidemic57. This clade structureis susceptible to homologous recombination, which is common inthis species44,58,59; to formalize clade definition, it must be revisitedaeftr the sampling of viruses representing the deep branches hasimproved suficiently. eTh current sampling defines a very smallmedian PD for human SARS-CoVs, which is approximately 15times smaller than the median PD determined for SARS-CoV-2(0.16% versus 2.6%; panel c of the figure in Box 4). This smallmedian PD of human SARS-CoVs also dominates thespecieswide PD distribution (0.25%; panel c of the figure in Box 4).Diagonal matrix of PPDs of 2,505 viruses clustered according to 49 coronavirusspecies, 39 established and 10 pending or tentative, and ordered from themost to least populous species, from left to right; green and white, PPDssmaller and larger than the inter-species threshold, respectively.

This completedesignation along with additional and important characteristics,such as pathogenic potential in humans or other hosts, should beincluded in the submission of each isolate genome sequence topublic databases such as GenBank. In publications, this name couldbe further extended with a sequence database ID\u2014for example,SARS-CoV-2/human/Wuhan/X1/2019_XYZ12345 (fictionalexample)\u2014when first mentioned in the text. We believe that this formatwill provide critical metadata on the major characteristics of eachparticular virus isolate (genome sequence) required for subsequentepidemiological and other studies, as well as for control measures.expanding the focus from pathogens to virus speciesHistorically, public health and fundamental research have beenfocused on the detection, containment, treatment and analysis ofviruses that are pathogenic to humans following their discovery(a reactive approach). Exploring and defining their biologicalcharacteristics in the context of the entire natural diversity as aspecies has never been a\u00a0priority. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as ahuman pathogen in December 2019 may thus be perceived ascompletely independent from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002\u20132003.Although SARS-CoV-2 is indeed not a descendent of SARS-CoV(Fig.\u00a02b), and the introduction of each of these viruses into humanswas likely facilitated by independent unknown external factors, thetwo viruses are genetically so close to each other (Fig.\u00a02c, panel c ofthe figure in Box 4) that their evolutionary histories andcharacteristics are mutually informative.The currently known viruses of the species Severe acuterespiratory syndrome-related coronavirus may be as (poorly)representative for this particular species as the few individuals that weselected to represent H. sapiens in Fig.\u00a0 1. It is thus reasonable toassume that this biased knowledge of the natural diversity of thespecies Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus limitsour current understanding of fundamental aspects of the biologyof this species and, as a consequence, our abilities to controlzoonotic spillovers to humans. Future studies aimed at understandingthe ecology of these viruses and advancing the accuracy andresolution of evolutionary analyses41 would benefit greatly fromadjusting our research and sampling strategies. This needs to include anexpansion of our current research focus on human pathogens andtheir adaptation to specific hosts to other viruses in this species.To illustrate the great potential of species-wide studies, it mayagain be instructive to draw a parallel to H. sapiens, andspecifically to the impressive advancements in personalized medicine inrecent years. Results of extensive genetic analyses of largenumbers of individuals representing diverse populations from allcontinents have been translated into clinical applications and greatlycontribute to optimizing patient-specific diagnostics and therapy.They were instrumental in identifying reliable predictive markersfor specific diseases as well as genomic sites that are underselection. It thus seems reasonable to expect that genome-basedanalyses with a comparable species coverage will be similarly insightfulfor coronaviruses. Also, additional diagnostic tools that target theentire species should be developed to complement existing toolsoptimized to detect individual pathogenic variants (a proactiveapproach). Technical solutions to this problem are alreadyavailable; for example, in the context of multiplex PCR-based assays42.The costs for developing and applying (combined or separate)species- and virus-specific diagnostic tests in specific clinical and/orepidemiological settings may help to better appreciate thebiological diversity and zoonotic potential of specific virus species andtheir members. Also, the further reduction of time required toidentify the causative agents of novel virus infections willcontribute to limiting the enormous social and economic consequences oflarge outbreaks. To advance such studies, innovative fundraisingapproaches may be required.Although this Consensus Statement focuses on a single virusspecies, the issues raised apply to other species in the family andpossibly beyond. A first step towards appreciation of this speciesand others would be for researchers, journals, databases and otherrelevant bodies to adopt proper referencing to the full taxonomyof coronaviruses under study, including explicit mentioning of therelevant virus species and the specific virus(es) within the speciesusing the ICTV naming rules explained above. This namingconvention is, regretfully, rarely observed in common practice, withmixing of virus and species names being frequently found in theliterature (including by the authors of this Consensus Statementon several past occasions). The adoption of accurate virus-namingpractices should be facilitated by the major revision of the virusspecies nomenclature that is currently being discussed by the ICTVand is being planned for implementation in the near future43. Withthis change in place, the CSG is resolved to address the existingsignificant overlap between virus and species names that complicatesthe appreciation and use of the species concept in its application tocoronaviruses.S.C.B., R.S.B., C.D., R.J.D.G., A.E.G., B.L.H., B.W.N., S.P., L.L.M.P., I.S. and J.Z. aremembers of the CSG, chaired by J.Z.; R.

The assessment of virus novelty also has implications forvirus naming and, on a different timescale, helps to define researchpriorities in virology and public health. The Study Groups areresponsible for assigning viruses to virus species and taxa of higher ranks,such as subgenera, genera and subfamilies. Accordingly,virus naming is not necessarily connected to disease but ratherinformed by other characteristics. The species name is italicized, starts with a capital letter and shouldnot be spelled in an abbreviated form7; hence the species name Severeacute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. This happened with SARS9\u201312 and with Middle East respiratorysyndrome (MERS)13,14 a few years later. In contrast, if the candidate virus is outside of known groups andits distances to viruses in these groups are comparable to thoseobserved between viruses of diefrent groups (intergroup distances),the candidate virus is distinct and can be considered novel.hTis evaluation is usually conducted in silico usingphylogenetic analysis, which may be complicated by unevenrates of evolution that vary across diefrent virus lineages andgenomic sites due to mutation, including the exchange ofgenome regions between closely related viruses (homologousrecombination). Taxonomical classification is hierarchical,using nested groups (taxa) that populate diefrent levels (ranks)of classification. Only the species and genus ranks need to be specifiedto classify a new virus; filling other ranks is optional. 16,18).According to our current knowledge, these vfie essential domains are the only ones conserved in all viruses of the orderNidovirales52. Homologous recombination, whichis common in coronaviruses53\u201355, is believed to be restricted ingenome regions encoding the most essential proteins, such asthose used for classification, and to members of the same virusspecies. To facilitate the useof rank thresholds outside of the DEmARC framework, theyare converted into PD and expressed as a percentage, whichresearchers commonly use to arrive at a tentative assignmentof a given virus within the coronavirus taxonomy followingconventional phylogenetic analysis of selected viruses. However, for assigning individual living organisms to most otherspecies, specialized knowledge and tools for assessinginter-individual differences are required. Note that these two taxonomies were independently developed using completely different criteria. Although no equivalence is implied, the species of coronaviruses is interpreted sensu stricto as accepted for the species of humans.the species composition was not affected and the virus was assignedto the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus,as detailed in Box\u00a04.With respect to novelty, SARS-CoV-2 differs from the two otherzoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, introducedto humans earlier in the twenty-first century. The CSG promotes this clear distinction because it willhelp improve the outbreak management and also reduces the risk ofconfusing virus and disease, as has been the case over many yearswith SARS-CoV (the virus) and SARS (the disease).To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange, the CSGrecommends that researchers describing new viruses (that is, isolates)in this species adopt a standardized format for public databases andpublications that closely resembles the formats used for isolates ofavian coronaviruses39, filoviruses40 and influenza virus1. uThs, the genomicvariation of the known viruses of the species Severe acute respiratorysyndrome-related coronavirus is smaller compared to that of othercomparably well-sampled species\u2014for example, those prototypedby MERS-CoV, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) andinfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (panel b of the gfiure in Box 4)\u2014andthis species is well separated from other known coronavirus speciesin the sequence space. Both of these characteristics facilitate theunambiguous assignment of SARS-CoV-2 to this species. Intra-species PDs of SARS-CoV-2 belong to the top 25% of thisspecies and also include the largest PD between SARS-CoV-2 andan African bat virus isolate (SARSr-CoV_BtKY72)56 (panel c ofthe figure in Box 4), representing two basal lineages within thespecies Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus thatconstitute very few known viruses (Fig. This clade structureis susceptible to homologous recombination, which is common inthis species44,58,59; to formalize clade definition, it must be revisitedaeftr the sampling of viruses representing the deep branches hasimproved suficiently. eTh current sampling defines a very smallmedian PD for human SARS-CoVs, which is approximately 15times smaller than the median PD determined for SARS-CoV-2(0.16% versus 2.6%; panel c of the figure in Box 4). Results of extensive genetic analyses of largenumbers of individuals representing diverse populations from allcontinents have been translated into clinical applications and greatlycontribute to optimizing patient-specific diagnostics and therapy. Also, additional diagnostic tools that target theentire species should be developed to complement existing toolsoptimized to detect individual pathogenic variants (a proactiveapproach). To advance such studies, innovative fundraisingapproaches may be required. Although this Consensus Statement focuses on a single virusspecies, the issues raised apply to other species in the family andpossibly beyond. 2Department of Medical Microbiology, LeidenUniversity Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands. 3Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics and Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology,Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia. 10Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA."}
