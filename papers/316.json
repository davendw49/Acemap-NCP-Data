This will put great burden onthe shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements.Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting,reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectiousdisease.In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases started to emergein local hospitals in Wuhan, China. transmissions between human were seen by the middleof January. And patient number increased sharply. In order to block the virus transmissionfrom entire China and even worldwide. This virus epidemic quickly became a public healthemergency of international concern by the World Health Organization.Wuhan municipal government issued an official order to stop all transportation betweenWuhan and the rest of China. Public transportations within Wuhan were also stopped. By9th, February 2020, China central government mobilized enormous amount of medicalsupplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces to support Wuhan. Till 11thFebruary\uff0c18700 healthcare personals belong to 154 medical teams had arrived in Wuhanand started to work with local hospitals. Wuhan government also declared regulations onresidence building control, which include identity check at building entrance and strictinfection control measures in buildings with suspect patients or identified patients.With all these intervention measures undertaken, and maybe more on the way, proper toolsare need anticipate possible effects on epidemic control and to provide reliable informationto support future decisions. Simulation also can help people understand how infectiousdisease spread and how to understand the purpose and consequences of various efforts.This current work was based on simulation model build on known transmission parametersfrom published research papers.MethodAccording to Qun Li et al. [1], 2019-nCoV\u2019s average incubation time is 7.5 days (95% CI5.3-19.0), 95% percentiles is 12.5 days. In early stage of the disease, patients\u2019 numberwould double every 7.4 days. Basic reproduction number (R0) was presumed to be 2.2(95% CI 1.4-3.9). In Qun\u2019s paper R0\u2019s 95% CI was between 1.4-3.9. R0=2, 3 or 4 wereused in model preparation. And 2 and 4 were ruled out because of obvious devotion fromopen reported data. So R0 was set at 3 in this simulation.Patient incubation time after been transmittedwas assigned by python numpyrandom.normal function, with parameters set as: loc ( mean value of random serie )=7.5,scale ( standard deviation) = 3.4. Values lower than 0 are converted to positive values. Inthis study, simulation cases can only transmit virus to new patients on the last day ofincubation to make calculation simple.According to media report and Wuhan government\u2019s announcement, the 2019-nCOVepidemic could be divided into 3 periods.Period 1: free transmission period (day 1 to day 50)Period 2: city-lock-down period (day 51 to day 70)Period 3: enforced control period (day 71 to day 90)The simulation would run like the diagram below.NP = AP \u009e R0 \u009e PAIPAI: personal activity index, an artificial index created to demonstrate patients\u2019 mobilitystatus in this study. PAI=1 means no restriction of social activity, while PAI=0 means totallygrounded (include in house isolation and all sorts of hospitalization) .Based on these parameters a simple simulation model was accomplished with python 3.6.All calculation was run on a mac pro notebook with 3.1 GHz duel core CPU and 8GBmemory. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status.Data were shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.ResultsSimulations were run by 50 times. 141427709 simulated patients were created withincubation time 7.5 \u00b1 3.4 days. The distribution of incubation time are show in Figure 2.By simulation, Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is2868.7\u00b11739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 by the end of period2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients reached a horrible number:913396.5 \u00b1 559099.9 (Table 1). And among these patients, 5% (more than 45000 patients)would be critically ill [2].According to simulation data, cumulative amount of infected patients (Figure 3), dailytransmission active patients (Figure 4), and daily new patients number (Figure 5) wouldkeep raising if PAI was above 0.3 which might cause a prolonged epidemic of a dreadfulvirus respiratory disease. When PAI was lower or equal to 0.3, a plateau would emerge.With stricter measures taken (PAI<0.3), the daily new patients number started to declinein period 3 respectively, see in Figure 6 to Figure 15 .Figure 8 simulated time distribution of daily new patients in period 3 (PAI=0.7)Figure 10 simulated time distribution of daily new patients in period 3 (PAI=0.5)Figure 12 simulated time distribution of daily new patients in period 3 (PAI=0.3)Figure 14 simulated time distribution of daily new patients in period 3 (PAI=0.1)4 unknown pneumonia patients were spotted by 29th December 2019 in Wuhan China. allpatients had history related to Huanan Seafood Market. Similar cases kept emerging. QunLi et al. collected 435 cases by the middle of January 2020[1]. Average incubation timeassumed to be 7.5 \u00b1 3.4 days (95% CI 5.3-19.0). In the early stage of disease, patientsnumber would be doubled every 7. 4days.R0 was calculated to be 2.2 ( 95% CI 1.4-3.9).National Health Commission issued an order to treat 2019-ConV as a category B infectiousdisease, controlled as category A (same policy as SARS). On the day of 23 January 2020,Wuhan municipal government decided to lock down the city. All public transportation exceptemergence services between this giant south China city and the rest of China werestopped. In-city public transportation services were also on held. China started to mobilizeenormous medical resources include healthcare teams to help Wuhan.Under multiple measures meant to contaminate this novel virus, diagnosed and suspectedcases kept increasing. Among the infected patients, 5% or more were in critical conditionand were located in intensive care units. When could the public see ending of this epidemicbecome a common concern. We used computer model simulation to show effects ofdifferent level of efforts in containing this virus from spreading. To make things simple,restrictions of patients\u2019 activities (including in-hospital treatment, cabin hospital stay, andin-house surveillance) were represented as personal activity index PAI.        Read, Jonathan\u2019s preprint work showed a R0 to be 3.6-4.0[3]. In our simulation study, datashow simulated patients to be 2868.7\u00b11739.0 by the end of period 1 (day50). Data fromChina Disease Control and Prevention Center shows cumulated patients number was31728 , daily new patients number was 3911 by 10th February,        Till 11th February 2020, more than 154 medical teams, 18700 healthcare personels weresent to Wuhan. A whole population body temperature monitoring program was alsoundertaken to identify fever patients. And local CDC announced to stop using timeconsuming RNA test as common diagnosis standard. Local residencies were locked downHow these measures would affect disease spreading is still not knowing. So we simulatedthe effects by set PAI from 0.9 to 0. PAI = 0.9 means no change in current people behaviorwhile PAI = 0 means total grounded (include hospital stay and in-house surveillance).With simulated data, we found that:Wuhan have 81700 hospital beds in nearly 300 hospitals among which 61 top tier hospitalsina2018governmentreportInfreetransmission stage, cumulated patients number reached 52185.4\u00b131621.4 on day 70.Critical care rate is 5% according to Zhong\u2019s preprint manuscript [2]. So more than 2600patients needed intensive care. This huge infectious patient number would stop all WuhanICUs from proper function.At the beginning of stage 3, different PAI were used to calculate future trends in diseaseepidemic. We found that new daily patients number seem to stay in plateau when PAI =0.3.When PAI reduced to 0.2, a decline in daily new patient could be seen. If PAI could berestricted to 0.1, an ideal state of zero new daily patient would show up at the end of period1. COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. It can cause strong inter peopletransmission. Enormous difficulties could be anticipated if not contained in early stage.2. 5% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care. This will put great burden on theshoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements.3. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. And long-termeffect relates to how well Wuhan fulfill this task.4. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to preventfuture unknown infectious disease.A respiratory disease spreading involves numerous factors. This simulation model usesonly arbitrary data to make the calculation. And also, parameters are simplified to makethe calculation faster, the results may be varying from real data. The model should bemodified using actual data in order to get more accurate results.Li, Q., et al., Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of NovelCoronavirusGuan, W.-j., et al., Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection inNovel coronavirusestimationandepidemicpredictions, in", "ref_list": [[], [""], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], ["J.M."], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "epidemic\nPeking University First Hospital General Practice Department\nBackground: In the beginning of January 2020, new unknown virus pneumonia cases\nstarted to emerge in local hospitals in Wuhan, China.
