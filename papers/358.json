The new virus has spread to at least 316 cities (until 1st February 2020) in China. We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities. occasionally transmitted to human due to wildlife consumption. Understanding the pattern of transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV is important for effective", "text": "30313233343536373839preventing and controlling the ongoing pandemic disease. The value of R0 (basicreproduction number) was estimated as 2.2, inferring a median size outbreak (3).However, based on the epidemic transmission model, the number of actual infectionswould be much larger than the number of confirmed cases (4).At present, tracking the passengers from Wuhan in January 2020 is still the toptask for preventing the further spread of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Toaccurately estimate the risk of the novel coronavirus, we compiled the detailed dailytraffic data outbound Wuhan from a big-data source, Baidu Map, before the lockdownof Hubei Province, in order to provide information for risk assessment of 2019-nCoVat the province level and the city level (Supp. Fig. 1).The traffic flow data outbound Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January 2020 wasdowned from Baidu Map Huiyan platform (5). The number of air passengers fromWuhan from 30th December 2019 to 20 January 2020 was released by Aviationtalk (6).The time series data of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases from 10th January to 30 January2020 was obtained from People's daily-Dingxiangyuan (1), which was released byChina National Health Commission.We did Spearman correlation analysis for the daily traffic from Wuhan (from 1stJanuary to 26th January) and the total traffic in this period with the number ofconfirmed cases (from 25th January to 30th January). To explain the variance ofconfirmed cases in all infected provinces, we developed multiple linear modelsincluding population, GDP, population density, and mean temperature as independentvariables. All analysis was performed using R (version 3.6.2).From 20th December 2019 to 20 January 2020, 854,424 air passengers leftWuhan Tianhe Airport to 49 cities in China (Fig .1). From 1st to 26th January, aboutthree million domestic passengers travelled from Wuhan to other cities. Among thepassengers, a few thousands had been confirmed to infected by the novel coronavirus(Fig. 2). The distribution of air passengers from Wuhan to other cities in China hadhigh correlation coefficients (0.71) with the number of confirmed infection cases inthose cities on 22nd January. The correlation coefficient drops to 0.56 on 24th January.Then the number of confirmed infection cases was positive correlation with local2population size.We used a multiple regression model to explain the variance of the number ofcases in the infected cities. After model selection, only two variables remained, thenumber of passengers and local population (Fig. 3). Overall, the population of theprovinces explains near half of the variance in the number of confirmed cases across34 provinces and province-level municipalities, whereas the number of passengersfrom Wuhan explained around 10% (Fig. 3).Correlation coefficients of number of confirmed that the number of cases in thecities (n=97) from 25th January to 30th January match the number of passengers fromWuhan during the period from 1st January to 26th January. The highest correlationappears on 5th January, inferring a long incubation period up to two weeks (Supp.Table 1).In the beginning of the spread of the pneumonia, there is a high correlation (0.71)between the number of confirmed infection cases and air passengers from Wuhan,proofed Wuhan the source of the pneumonia (7). As time going, local populationplayed a more dominant role, because the local spread of 2019-nCoV is likely tohappen. The basic reproductive number of the infection ( 0) to be estimated as 3.8means 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented to stop the outbreak (4).Fortunately, the transmission of the virus was really controlled due to strict preventionmeasures carried out by Chinese government. Restricted population movements banwas enforced upon 16 cities in Hubei Province since 23rd January 2020 (8), resultingin significant decrease in passengers from Wuhan and adjacent cities, whicheffectively reduces the spread of the pneumonia. However, 3-5 million people had leftWuhan for numerous cities in China before the province lockdown (Supp. Fig.2), andamong them a number of infected people have no clinical symptom yet infectious toothers. We believe this is the highest challenge against the current national levelantivirus campaign.Currently the first-level response to major public health emergencies has beeninitiated in 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China on 25thJanuary 2020 (9), so that strict control procedures are carried out to prevent the spreadof the virus. According to an infectious disease model, it was estimated that the actualnumber of infected people in Wuhan on 4th February 2020 may reach 250 thousand(prediction interval, 164,602 to 351,396) without any control (3). Whereas only 5,142confirmed infections were reported in China on 2nd February 2020. Starting from 3rdFebruary, all suspected case in Wuhan will be taken in to medical care, and the virusspread in Wuhan can be controlled gradually.The correlation coefficients between the number of confirmed cases from 26thJanuary to 30th January and number of passengers from Wuhan were higher than thaton 25th January (Supp. Table 1). We think the reason is that the confirmed cases on25th is too low due to lack of virus detection kit. After 25th January the supply of virusdetection kit was enough and the number of confirmed cases reflect the real situation,which have very high correlation with the number of passengers from Wuhan to thesecities during 1st January to 26th January. We notice the highest correlation appear on5th January, two to three weeks ahead of the confirmed cases in those cities(confirmation also needs several days to complete at that time), which infers the longlatent period of 2019-nCoV.Combining the two variables (local population and passengers from Wuhan) tointerpret the virus outbreak risk, we recommend that the preventing and controllingmeasures can be divided into two different stages. In the early stage, checking thepassengers from Wuhan is more important. Some cities (e.g., Wenzhou in ZhejiangProvince) with a large number of returnees from Wuhan have many cases even whenthey are far from Wuhan in space. The database of travel routes of confirmed patientshas been developed and published for free use (10), in order to tracking and warningclose contactors. In the late stage, local population become the most important factorin predicting the number of confirmed infection cases. This suggests us that thedensely populated metropolitan areas, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, andShenzhen should pay special attentions to preventing the second-generation infections.Moreover, the densely populated rural areas around Wuhan may face double threats ofthe spread of infectious people from Wuhan and a large number of local susceptiblepeople. These areas, including areas of Hubei Province except for Wuhan, andsurrounding area of Henan (Nanyang, Xinyang) and Chongqing, need to prepare for asurge in infection. The rural medical facilities in these areas are scarcer than in cities,clustering cases are more likely to happen in these places.126127128129during the period from 30th December 2019 to 20th January 2020.
