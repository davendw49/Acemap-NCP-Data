In Hubei, it was estimated as51525354555657585960616263646566676869707172732.4 days. The cumulative incidence of Hubei doubled 5 times (Figure 1B). Provinces with the cumulativeincidence doubled \u22655 times, and mean doubling time <2d included Chongqing, Fujian, Heilongjiang,experienced a faster and consistent epidemic growth (Figures 1 and S2).The aggregate cumulative incidence of all non-Hubei provinces increased over time (Figure S3)and therefore suggested a sub-exponential growth of the epidemic outside Hubei. The gradual piece-mealincrease in doubling time could be explained by the practice of self-quarantine since the Chinese NewYear and the different levels of intra-and-inter-provincial travel restrictions imposed across China sincethe travel quarantine of Wuhan (imposed on Jan 23, 2020) (7).The limitations of our study included the incompleteness of the cumulative incidence data asreported by mainland Chinese authorities. One potential reason for underreporting is underdiagnosis, dueto the lack of diagnostic tests, healthcare workers and other resources. Differential underreporting acrossprovinces could have biased the data. However, as long as the rate of reporting remains constant overtime within the same province, the calculation of doubling times remains reliable. However, increasedawareness and increased availability of diagnostic tests might have improved the reporting rate over time.This might artificially shorten the doubling time. Nevertheless, apart for Hubei, for the majority ofmainland China, cases were only reported since January 20, 2020. It was when the Chinese authoritiesopenly acknowledged the seriousness of the outbreak. Therefore, the bias due to increased awarenessmight be small to negligible.We analyzed the epidemic doubling time of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak by province in mainlandChina. The mean doubling time of cumulative incidence in Hubei was 2.4 days (January 20 throughFebruary 2, 2020) but the mean doubling time of Henan, Hunan, and Shandong were the lowest.747576777879808182838485868788899091Trajectory of increasing doubling time by province indicated social distancing measures adopted in Chinaslowed the epidemic with some success.Kamalich Muniz-Rodriguez, MPH, is a doctoral student at the Jiann-Ping Hsu College of Public Health,Georgia Southern University.

R0 is a widely used indicator of transmission potential in a totally susceptible population andis driven by the average contact rate and the mean infectious period of the disease (        Scope and definition. We restricted our analysis to mainland China in this paper. A \u2018province\u2019 hereinencompasses three different types of political sub-divisions of mainland China, namely, a province, adirectly administered municipality (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin) and an autonomousregion (Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet, and Xinjiang). Our analysis does not include HongKong Special Administrative Region and Macau Special Administrative Region, which are undereffective rule of the People\u2019s Republic of China through the so-called \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019political arrangements. Likewise, our analysis does not include Taiwan, which is de facto governed by adifferent government (the Republic of China).        Data apart from epidemic data. Provincial demographic, transportation and socioeconomic data wereobtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (        Doubling time calculation was conducted using MATLAB R2019b (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Multiplelinear regression analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team). Significance level was apriori decided to be \u03b1 = 0.05.Demographic, transportation and socioeconomic factors. We performed multiple linear regressionmodels with the latest doubling time, mean doubling time and the slope of the doubling time over thenumber of times the cumulative incidence doubles as the dependent variables, respectively. We includedpopulation density, average temperature in January, average household size, subnational HumanDevelopment Index in all models. We included passenger traffic and provincial capital\u2019s distance fromWuhan, for railway (models group A) and highway (models group B) respectively. However, none of theindependent variables were found statistically significantly (p > 0.05) associated with any of thedependent variables (Table S2).We performed sensitivity analysis by expanding our data analysis to the data since January 31, 2019,when Hubei first reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unexplained etiology that turned out to be2019-nCoV. The only difference between the sensitivity analysis and the main analysis is the inclusion ofHubei data from January 31, 2019 through January 19, 2020, because all other provinces started to reportcases on January 20, 2020. The only differences in results were found for Hubei, with the mean doublingtime being 3.85 (Figures S4, S6), and the cumulative incidence in Hubei doubled 8 times from January31, 2019 through February 2, 2020 (Figures S5, S6). The first doubling time of Hubei (Figure S5) washigh, reflecting that real-time data was unavailable before mid-January. It was only by January 17, 2020onwards when data reporting become increasingly transparent and timely.        In our sensitivity analysis, we performed the same multiple regression models previously described, withthe mean doubling time, and the slope of the doubling time over the number of times the cumulativeincidence doubles as dependent variables. We included population density, average temperature inJanuary, average household size, subnational Human Development Index in all models. We includedpassenger traffic and provincial capital\u2019s distance from Wuhan, for railway and highway respectively.However, none of the independent variables were found statistically significantly (p > 0.05) associatedwith the three dependent variables (results not shown).Provincial Capital\u2019s Distance from Wuhan (Railway) (km)Provincial Capital\u2019s Distance from Wuhan (Highway) (km)Population Density (10000 person per km2)Average Temperature for January (\u00b0C)Average Household size (2018)(Subnational) Human development index (HDI)xxxxxxxxxxxx(        Figure S6.
