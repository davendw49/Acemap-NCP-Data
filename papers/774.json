Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to\u00a0 protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA\u00a0 complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides \u200bin vitro\u200b to\u00a0 deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are\u00a0 often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 15 epitope-HLA-binding\u00a0 prediction tools, and using an \u200bin vitro\u200b peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides\u00a0 that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of\u00a0 potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance\u00a0 when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in\u00a0 question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is\u00a0 therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high\u00a0 prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes. Our findings may\u00a0 contribute to the design of an efficacious vaccine against COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0", "text": "        Introduction\u00a02019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019, following\u00a0a series of unexplained pneumonia cases \u200b        Results\u00a0We set out to identify peptides with epitope potential in a future COVID-19 vaccine. We\u00a0commenced by translating the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (\u200bACCESSION MN908947,\u00a0VERSION MN908947.3) \u200bto protein-coding sequence and predicted potential epitopes in a\u00a0sliding window of 9 using netMHC tools (netMHC/II and \u201c-pan\u201d versions, when allotype was not\u00a0available). We identified the top 94 predicted peptides for 11 HLA allotypes (94 x 11 = 1034),\u00a0and went further to validate the binding of these 94 peptides to each allotype in an \u200bin vitro\u00a0MHC:peptide complex stability assay (NeoScreen\u200b\u24c7\u200b). We removed eight peptides that were\u00a0synthetically introduced when translating the DNA sequence to protein sequence. Of the\u00a0remaining 1,026 peptides we observed a high degree of overlap between different allotypes,\u00a0resulting in 777 unique peptides. We found that 174 of the 777 unique peptides formed a\u00a0stable peptide-HLA complex. Of these 174 peptides, 48 were previously measured and\u00a0deposited in IEDB in relation to SARS and the remaining 126 peptides are novel. The full list of\u00a0predicted binders (excluding synthetic peptides) can be found in the supplementary material\u00a0(Supplementary Data S1).\u00a0\u00a0In order to first assess potential variability across the stability measurements we made\u00a0replicate measurements (\u200bn\u200b = 4) of 120 peptides on 8 HLA alleles. Each peptide was measured\u00a0with urea in 4 different concentrations (0M, 2M, 4M, 6M), and we observed an average\u00a0standard deviation between replicates of 0.10 with an average mean of 0.56. All remaining\u00a0experiments were performed in duplicate for all concentrations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To further address whether alternative prediction tools would have higher concordance with\u00a0measured stability, we performed predictions for all tools listed in Table 1. Predictions for\u00a0the 15 different tools were performed either through their web server or a stand-alone\u00a0version, (see Materials and methods section for details). Furthermore, using in-house stability\u00a0data, we developed PrdX 1.0, a prediction tool for a single allele HLA-A*02:01, where all\u00a0other tools performed most poorly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We assessed the false positive rate for each tool via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)\u00a0curves, and their Area under curve (AUC) for all allotypes that had more than 10 binders. The\u00a0analysis revealed that ANN 4.0 achieved the highest score for allotype HLA-A*01:01 (AUC =\u00a097,47; Figure 1A), closely followed by NetMHCcons 1.1, NetMHCpan_BA 4.0 and IEDB-AR\u00a0Consensus. PrdX 1.0 scored highest for HLA-A*02:01 (AUC = 85.54; Figure 1B), NetMHCcons 1.1\u00a0scored highest for HLA-A*03:01 (AUC = 79.25; Figure 1C), and MHCflurry 1.3.0 performed best\u00a0for HLA-B*40:01 (AUC = 91.06; Figure 1F). NetMHCstab 1.0 was the only tool that achieved the\u00a0highest score for more than 1 allotype: HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-A*24:02\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Figure 1.

Corresponding area\u00a0under curve (AUC) values are listed in Table 2.\u00a0\u00a0(AUC = 89.80; 86.03; Figure 1D, E, respectively). Out of the tools tested for HLA class II,\u00a0IEDB-AR Consensus achieved the highest score for HLA-DRB1*04:01 (AUC = 81,31; Figure 1G).\u00a0Table 2 provides all AUC values, and the result obtained for each allotype is marked in bold.\u00a0Notably, in the case of HLA-A*02:01 we observed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0particularly poor performance among all tested tools despite the extensive amount of data\u00a0available for this allotype.\u00a0\u00a0To assess the correlation between the predicted and measured peptide-HLA complexes,\u00a0Spearman correlation was calculated for all allotypes. This revealed significant\u00a0inconsistencies in performance depending on the predicted allotype. PSSMHCpan 1.0\u00a0displayed the highest consistency, taking into account its coverage (Table 1), but the\u00a0correlation mean scored lower than other tools such as IEDB-AR Consensus, MixMHCpred 2.0.2,\u00a0NetMHCpan_EL 4.0 or PrdX 1.0. The results of the Spearman correlations are summarised in\u00a0Figure 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        Here we benchmark a number of tools to identify epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 virus, and validate\u00a0via stability assay the binding of candidate epitopes to 10 allotypes of HLA class I and one\u00a0allotype of HLA class II. We find that the false positive rate is high for all tested tools when\u00a0testing for predicted HLA-binding peptides from SARS-CoV-2 virus. This creates a challenge for\u00a0vaccine development efforts, especially for the design of epitope vaccines, where only a\u00a0limited number of epitopes may be included. Furthermore, it highlights the risk for failed\u00a0vaccine design (for any pathogen or disease) if predicted HLA-binding protein regions in\u00a0reality do not bind and allow immune presentation and response.\u00a0\u00a0We observed, remarkably, that all tools tested performed poorly for HLA-A*02:01, which is\u00a0the allotype with most training data available \u200b        All epitopes are available at the vendor webpage (\u200bwww.immunitrack.com\u200b) and in\u00a0supplemental materials (Data S2.).\u00a0        Fifteen prediction tools tested on a relevant dataset of peptides from the SARS-CoV-2 genome\u00a0(assembly \u200bMN908947.3\u200b).
