Bruno Kessler Foundation, Trento, Italy212223242526272829303132333435363738394041Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposeda substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemicthreat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group.Methods We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 toFebruary 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. Weused methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimatethe CFR among detected cases.Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual recordsfor 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceasedwere significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years,p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in lessdeveloped economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI:1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24%among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher thanthat among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that amongmoderate, severe and critical patients.Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases4243444546474849505152535455565758596061ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severeacute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but moresimilar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalizedpatients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age.Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and caninform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.As of March 3, 2020, a total of 80,270 cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) have been reported in mainland China, including 2,981 deaths. Theoutbreak is caused by a novel coronavirus of presumed zoonotic origin, thesevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. COVID-19 caseshave now been identified in 72 countries, some of which have reported onwardlocal transmission and deaths2. The unprecedented scale of the epidemic hasprompted an urgent need for clinical severity assessment, of which the casefatality risk (CFR) is a key metric.A few studies have assessed the fatality risk of COVID-19 but estimates have been626364656667686970717273747576777879808182highly variable. Wu et al. estimated that the fatality risk among hospitalized caseswas 14% during the early phase of outbreak in Wuhan3. Dorigatti et al. estimatedthat the CFR among laboratory-confirmed cases was 18% in Hubei province andranged from 1.2-5.6% outside mainland China4. A recent report of the WorldHealth Organization (WHO)-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019estimated the case fatality risk as 3.8% by dividing the number of deaths at thetime of analysis by the number of laboratory-confirmed cases at the time ofanalysis5. They also reported a higher case fatality risk in Hubei than that in otherprovinces (5.8% vs. 0.7%)5. However, those estimates would be a lower bound onthe CFR for the laboratory-confirmed cases because many cases were still in thehospital and had not reached a final outcome of either death or discharge afterrecovery6.In the present study, we aimed to assess the CFR among laboratory-confirmedCOVID-19 cases detected in mainland China, stratified by different clinicalcategories (e.g. mild-, moderate-, severe- and critical-patients) and by age group.We also explored the risk factors associated with fatal outcomes.Case definitions and surveillanceThe National Health Commission of China (NHC) and the Chinese Center forDisease Control and Prevention (China CDC) have launched a new surveillance8384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103system to record information on COVID-19 cases since the start of the outbreakof atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan in late December 2019. A description ofthe surveillance system is provided elsewhere7. As the epidemic evolves, a totalof six versions of case definitions for suspected- and laboratory-confirmed-caseshave been issued by NHC7-9. Details are provided in the Appendix table S1.Four clinical categories of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients have beenidentified by NHC, including mild-, moderate-, severe-, and critical-patients 7-9.Mild patients, introduced in the fifth and sixth versions of COVID-19 casedefinition, refer to patients with mild symptoms and no radiographic evidence ofpneumonia. Moderate patients, introduced in the fourth version of the casedefinition, refers to patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiographicevidence of pneumonia. Severe patients, introduced in the second version, refersto patients with any breathing problems, finger oxygen saturation, and lowPaO2/FiO2 (PaO2 denotes partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood; FiO2denotes fraction of inspired oxygen), etc. Critical patients, a definition used fromthe very beginning of the outbreak, refer to patients having any respiratoryfailure, shock, and any other organ failure that requires ICU admission.Patients were discharged when they met all the following criteria: 1) normalbody temperature for more than 3 days, 2) significantly improved respiratorysymptoms, 3) significant inflammation absorption in lung radiographic findings,and 4) negative nucleic acid detection by real-time RT-PCR using respiratory104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124specimens on two consecutive days, with a sampling interval \u22651 day9.Daily aggregated data (hereafter called aggregated dataset) on the cumulativenumber of cases were extracted from the websites of national, provincial, andmunicipal Health Commissions. Individual records on laboratory-confirmedCOVID-19 cases (hereafter called individual dataset) were collected from twoofficial publicly available sources from December 29, 2019 through to February23, 2020, including: 1) the websites of national, provincial, and municipal HealthCommission; 2) the websites of national and local government affiliated medias.Individual information was extracted and entered into a structured databasecomprising demographic characteristics, dates of symptom onset, first healthcareconsultation, hospital admission, official announcement (reporting date), as wellas outcome information (e.g. death/discharge and corresponding dates). Eachindividual record was extracted and entered by three coauthors and wascross-checked to ensure data accuracy. Conflicting information was resolvedbased on the Health Commission data. Details on the collection of individual dataand assessment of completeness of variables used in the study are provided in125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145We restricted analyses of demographic characteristics, risk factors associatedwith fatal outcome, and key time to event intervals to the provinces outsideHubei, where the majority of individual records were obtained (97.6%,9,651/9,886) as of February 23, 2020. We implemented a multivariate logisticregression model to explore the risk factors associated with death. We includedage, sex, economic region10, time interval from symptom onset to first medicalconsultation, first hospital admission, and laboratory diagnosis. We categorizedChina into three economic regions (East, Central, West and Northeast) accordingto gross domestic product per capita in 2018 (see Appendix Figure S1 for map)10.We estimated key time-to-event distributions including symptom onset to firsthealthcare consultation, hospital admission, laboratory diagnosis, and death ordischarge, and from hospital admission to death or discharge. We fitted threeparametric distributions (Weibull, gamma, and lognormal) to time-to-event dataand selected the best fit based on the minimum Akaike information criterion.We used three methods to estimate CFR among COVID-19 cases. Firstly, wecalculated a crude CFR based on the cumulative number of deaths divided by thecumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases, ignoring the time-lag betweensymptoms onset and death and resulting right-censoring of outcomes5.In a second approach, we adjusted for delays between hospitalization and deathto obtain more accurate estimates of CFR, using the method described by Garskeet al. for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in 200911. For above two methods, we used146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166the aggregated dataset as of February 23, and binomial distributions were usedto estimate the 95%CIs.Thirdly, to allow for incomplete information about outcomes, we used survivalanalyses to allow inclusion of all cases admitted to hospital in the individualdataset, incorporating data for patients who were still in hospital at the time ofanalysis. In our individual dataset, the outcome was unavailable for somepatients because the information was not communicated through publicchannels, although these patients may have been discharged or died at the timeof this writing (hereafter denoted as missing outcome). This is different from theissue of right-censoring for patients still hospitalized whose illnesses have yet tobe resolved. The cases who were still hospitalized and those with missingoutcome were treated as unresolved in our analysis. A multiple imputation wasused to generate outcomes for these patients.For each date t, we calculated the number of discharged/deceased patients thatrequired imputation by subtracting the number of discharged/deceased patientsin our individual dataset from that in the aggregated dataset (Table S4 inAppendix). All these patients with missing data for outcomes before date t wereconsidered for imputation on date t. They were randomly selected as dischargeor death according to probability calculated using the density of interval fromhospital admission to discharge/death. This imputation procedure was repeated100 times to generate 100 imputed datasets for further estimation of CFR.167168169170171172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186We employed a dual-outcome (discharge or death) time to event framework toestimate CFR based on the fraction F1/(F1+F2)12. F1 and F2 stand for theadmission to death distribution and the admission to discharge distribution,respectively.Where,denotes the distinct observed event times for outcomes(discharge or death), withrepresenting the number of outcome j that occuris the Kaplan-Meier estimator of overall survival function(combined event of discharge or death)12. Then we implemented a 1,000 timesbootstraps for estimation of 95%CIs, and used Rubin\u2019s formula to pool allestimates across 100 imputed datasets13.For the survival analysis, we restricted analyses to the provinces outside Hubei,considering the completeness of individual records obtained. When estimatingCFR, we excluded cases hospitalized beyond 17 days on each date in the baselineanalysis. The choice of 17 days was based on the 90th percentile of thedistribution of the time from hospitalization to outcome (discharge/death)among COVID-19 cases in the provinces other than Hubei as of February 23. As asensitivity analysis, we also considered the 80th and 50th percentiles of thisdistribution, corresponding to 14 days and 10 days, respectively. As mentionedabove, patients were discharged only after testing negative by nucleic aciddetection tests on two consecutive days9. Hence, we assumed that these patients187188189190191192193194195196197198199200201202203204205206207had biologically recovered three days prior to the reported date of discharge,accounting for one additional day for delay of laboratory confirmation andofficial reporting. Accordingly, for the discharged patients, their time fromhospitalization to discharge was cut down by three days when estimating the90th, 80th and 50th percentiles of the distribution of the time from hospitalizationto outcome.All deaths occurred among critical cases, as reported by China CDC5. Separatelyfor mainland China, Hubei Province, and the provinces outside Hubei, we furtherestimated CFRs among severe and critical patients by dividing the above derivedCFR by proportions of severe and critical patients among all reported COVID-19cases. We used the average of daily proportions among COVID-19 cases who werestill in hospitals on each day other than the clinical severity on admission, whichwere obtained from the aggregated dataset and showed very stable (Table S2,and Figure S2-3 in Appendix). Only Guangdong Province officially reportedaggregated data on mild-, moderate-, severe- and critical patients. And thus, forthe provinces outside Hubei, we additionally estimated the CFR by these clinicalcategories using the corresponding proportions in Guangdong Province.Statistical analyses were performed with R (version 3.6.0).The study was approved by the Institutional review board from School of Public208209210211212213214215216217218219220221222223224225226227228Health, Fudan University (IRB#2020-02-0802). All data were collected frompublicly available sources and did not contain any personal information.As of February 23, 2020, a total of 77,150 laboratory-confirmed cases with 2,592deaths, 24,711 discharged and 49,847 patients who were still hospitalized werereported in mainland China (see Table S2 for details of each province). Of these,provinces outside Hubei accounted for 12,863 (16.7%, 12,863/77,150)laboratory-confirmed cases including 97 deaths (3.7%, 97/2,592), 7,973 (32.3%,7,973/24,711) discharged cases and 4,793 (9.6%, 4,793/49,847) patients whowere still hospitalized. We collected individual information from publiclyavailable official sources on 9,651 laboratory-confirmed cases detected outsideHubei by February 23, accounting for 75.0% (9,651/12,863) of total casesreported, 63.9% (62/97) of deceased patients, 18.2% (1,449/7,973) of recoveredpatients. Of 9,651 cases, unresolved patients accounted for 84.3% (8,140/9,651)(Table 1). See Figure S4 for the epidemic curve of cases with available individualinformation.The median age of the cases outside Hubei was 45 years (range, four days-97years), and 51% (4,956/9,651) were male. Those who died were significantlyolder than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 77% (48/62)of deaths occurred in the older adults aged 65 years or above, and 58% (36/62)229230231232233234235236237238239240241242243244245246247248249were male. (Table 1) Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that increasing age,being male, and living in less developed economic regions (e.g. Central region orWest and Northeast region) were risk factors for mortality (Table 2). Theunivariate logistic analysis is shown in Appendix Table S5.The intervals from symptom onset to first healthcare consultation, fromsymptom onset to hospitalization, and from symptom onset to laboratoryconfirmation were consistently longer for deceased patients than for those whorecovered. Overall, the time interval from symptom onset to death was estimatedto be 12.9 days (95%CI: 2.2 to 40.2), and from symptom onset to discharge was16.7 days (95%CI: 8.6 to 28.9). (Table 3)Based on the total patients reported to the surveillance system, the CFRestimated by Garske\u2019s method11 and survival analyses were all higher than thecrude CFR (Table 4 and Appendix Table S6). The CFR estimated by Garske\u2019smethod11 was 4.52% (95%CI: 4.47% to 4.67%) in mainland China, with highestestimate in Wuhan (6.19%, 95%CI: 6.12% to 6.41%), and lowest in the provincesoutside Hubei (0.89%, 95%CI: 0.83% to 1.06%). The CFR estimated by survivalanalyses was 1.24% (95%CI: 1.24% to 1.24%) among all cases, and 11.21%(95%CI: 11.21% to 11.21%) among severe and critical patients outside Hubei.There was no difference in both overall CFR and that among severe and criticalpatients outside Hubei estimated by survival analyses or Garske\u2019s method(p>0.05) (Table 4). In sensitivity analyses, we excluded all cases hospitalized for250251252253254255256257258259260261262263264265266267268269270longer than 14 and 10 days, and the estimates were all consistent with those ofthe baseline analysis, in which we excluded cases with hospitalizations longerthan 17 days (p>0.05) (Appendix, Figure S5-6).In the provinces other than Hubei, the CFR increased with age, with highestestimates among patients aged \u226570 years (Figure 1 panel B). The fatality riskamong critical patients was 23.8-33.3%, which was 2-fold higher than thatamong severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate,severe and critical patients (Figure 1 panel B). The CFR among all casesestimated by survival analyses declined rapidly from 8% on January 25 to around1% on January 28, and remained at 1.2-1.5% afterwards. Patterns were similarfor estimates using Garske\u2019s method (Figure 2).We have shown that the fatality risk among detected cases was 0.89-1.24% in theprovinces outside Hubei in mainland China and increased with clinical severity.Further, the CFR was estimated at 8.02-11.21% among severe and criticalpatients. Estimates accounting for right-censoring of unresolved cases werehigher than crude estimates. Male patients, older age, and less developed regionswere factors associated with a higher CFR. These estimates could represent themost accurate estimates of CFR in China so far.Our study is strengthened by accounting for unknown outcomes among patients271272273274275276277278279280281282283284285286287288289290291who were still in hospital at time of data cutoff. We used Garske\u2019s methoddeveloped for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 in 200911, as well as survival analyses,both of which consider censoring. Compared to the crude CFR, Garske\u2019s methodimproved estimates by adjusting for the cumulative density of intervals fromhospital admission to death/discharge. Survival analysis was a useful tool forcomparison as it relied on a very large individual dataset comprising a total of9,651 reported cases. Availability of individual data enabled us to exploremortality risk factors and estimate CFR by age group. Estimates have not beenreported previously based on such a large sample size and a competing riskmodel of survival analysis with 90th quantile truncation. There was no differencein CFR estimates by the two methods, which lends support to our estimates.Our study has some limitations. First, in the individual dataset, the clinical profileof patients was not available. Hence, we could not provide direct estimates offatality risk stratified by clinical categories using survival analysis. Instead, wedivided the estimated CFR among all cases by the proportions of different clinicalcategories obtained from the aggregated dataset. This is a reasonable approachmethod because all deaths occurred among critical cases 5.Second, the analyzed individual records were retrieved from publicly availableofficial sources, ensuring accuracy and reliability of information. However, wewere only able to collect few individual records in Hubei because they did notrelease complete individual information. And thus, we were unable to estimate292293294295296297298299300301302303304305306307308309310311312CFR in Hubei using survival analyses. Moreover, assessment of clinical severity inHubei, especially in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, is challengingbecause disease severity may be increased by bottlenecks in local healthcarecapacity, as COVID-19 cases surged. In addition, case surveillance and clinicalmanagement were biased towards severe cases in Hubei, especially in the earlyphase of the epidemic. Our estimates of the CFR in Hubei and Wuhan usingGarske\u2019s method11 should be viewed cautiously as the sensitivity of surveillanceof both deaths and cases remains unclear.Our study only addresses CFR among detected cases. The level of ascertainmentof mild cases remains unclear. More estimates that include fatality risk amongsyndromic patients and asymptomatically infected individuals can only beavailable through enhanced routine surveillance, such as increased testing ofpatients with influenza-like-illnesses, and by analysis of futureOur CFR estimates of 0.89-1.24% among detected COVID-19 patients outsideHubei province are higher than the crude CFRs reported by WHO and China CDC,which is 0.4-0.7%5,14. It is expected that the crude CFR obtained by dividing thecumulative number of reported deaths by the cumulative number of reportedcases is an underestimate due to the inevitable delay between symptom onsetand death. Our findings reveal that older individuals and male patientsexperience higher fatality risk, which is consistent with the WHO report 14.313314315316317318319320321322323324325326327328329330331332333Additionally, WHO reported that patients with underlying conditions had muchhigher fatality rates14. Our study was unable to address the relative risk of fataloutcome among patients with underlying diseases compared to healthy people,because limited information on underlying conditions was available frompublicly available data sources.A clinical study conducted in Wuhan showed that 4.3% of hospitalized patientsdied15. Another study relying on patients from 552 hospitals across 30 provinces,found that 1.4% of patients died 16, in which less study participants (28%) werefrom Wuhan. The estimates of these clinical studies would be the lower boundsfor the CFR since separately 62% and 94% of patients were still in hospitals. Thefatality risk from these clinical studies is higher than our CFR estimates, probablydue to shortage of health services in Wuhan, e.g., advanced health care facilitiesfor critically ill patients as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.Our CFR estimates outside Hubei province indicate that the severity ofSARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of other diseases caused by zoonoticcoronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which hadan estimated CFR of 34.4% globally17, and severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) with an estimated CFR of 10.9% across the world and 7% in mainlandChina18. In contrast, the CFR of SARS-CoV is in the same order of magnitude asthat of pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus hospitalizations, which has anestimated CFR of 1.4% among hospitalized patients in Asia19. In the long run,334335336337338339340341342343344345346347348349350351352353354depending on how much of the severity pyramid of SARS-CoV2 is captured in ourdata, the absolute severity of SARS-CoV2 may prove to be similar, to somewhatmore severe, than the 2009 influenza pandemic, albeit with a different age profile.Comparison of clinical data from China and other countries will prove useful tosettle this question.Outside Hubei province, close contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases were keptin quarantine for 14 days, and local hospitals tested patients with respiratorysymptoms (e.g., fever and cough) and epidemiological links to Hubei province orother cases. This strategy would have enabled detection of many mild cases.However, a small number of mild cases were captured. In our aggregated datasetfor Guangdong province for instance, only 8% of reported cases were mild, whilethe majority (83%) of reported cases had moderate disease severity withpresence of pneumonia. And thus, our CFR estimates could approximatelyrepresent the fatality risk among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases withchest x-ray confirmed pneumonia. Even though clinical information for thesepatients was not available from publicly available sources, we believe that ourCFR estimates could be viewed as the fatality risk among hospitalized COVID-19cases. Chest x-ray confirmed pneumonia is a threshold for hospital admissions inin China. This may vary among countries due to different clinical practices andhealth service capacity.Clinical studies have reported a higher proportion of severe patients among older355356357358359360361362363364365366367368369370371372373374375age group (29% vs. 14%)16. No specialized treatment for COVID-19 patients hasbeen identified, and the mainstay clinical management has been supportive care.For non-critically ill patients, close follow-up is likely to be sufficient to managethe disease. But critically ill patients were more likely to develop ARDS andrequire ICU admission20. That could explain our findings that severe patients hada higher fatality risk. The high observed CFRs of COVID-19 in older adults isconsistent with the age profile of MERS, SARS, pandemic H1N1 2009, andseasonal influenza.19Compared to the Eastern region, cases detected in the less developed Centralregion had a 2.45-fold higher risk of death, and those in West and Northeastregion had a 2.93-fold higher risk. It is important to note that those variations inCFR do not reflect underlying differences in clinical disease severity. CFR willvary regionally depending on the sensitivity of surveillance systems to detectcases at different levels of the severity pyramid and clinical care offered to severeand critical patients. More attention should be paid to less developed settingswith limited health services like Iran, which reports a larger ratio of deaths tocases than other countries2.Notably, the definition of suspected cases eligible for laboratory testing used inChina shifted from a narrow clinical criteria based on three symptoms early inthe outbreak (fever; radiographic findings of pneumonia; normal or reducedwhite blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count at early onset of symptoms),376377378379380381382383384385386387388389390391392393394395396to a broader criteria including any two of three symptoms by January 27. Thiswould bias our sample towards more clinically severe cases before January 27. Inaddition to improvement in therapeutic capacity, the shift in surveillancedefinition could partially explain the declining trend of CFR from 8% to around 1%at the end of January, which remained stable afterwards. Accordingly, our CFRestimate for February could provide a true picture of the severity oflaboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19.In conclusion, our estimates of CFR among laboratory-confirmed cases suggestthat COVID-19 is not as severe as SARS and MERS, but similar to that of pandemic2009 H1N1 among hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 cases ishigher in male, and increases with age, particularly in adults aged 70 years andabove.

Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies, Fogarty4. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual recordsfor 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. Case definitions and surveillanceThe National Health Commission of China (NHC) and the Chinese Center forDisease Control and Prevention (China CDC) have launched a new surveillance8384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103system to record information on COVID-19 cases since the start of the outbreakof atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan in late December 2019. Critical patients, a definition used fromthe very beginning of the outbreak, refer to patients having any respiratoryfailure, shock, and any other organ failure that requires ICU admission. Conflicting information was resolvedbased on the Health Commission data. Details on the collection of individual dataand assessment of completeness of variables used in the study are provided in125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145We restricted analyses of demographic characteristics, risk factors associatedwith fatal outcome, and key time to event intervals to the provinces outsideHubei, where the majority of individual records were obtained (97.6%,9,651/9,886) as of February 23, 2020. Firstly, wecalculated a crude CFR based on the cumulative number of deaths divided by thecumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases, ignoring the time-lag betweensymptoms onset and death and resulting right-censoring of outcomes5.In a second approach, we adjusted for delays between hospitalization and deathto obtain more accurate estimates of CFR, using the method described by Garskeet al. This is different from theissue of right-censoring for patients still hospitalized whose illnesses have yet tobe resolved. Then we implemented a 1,000 timesbootstraps for estimation of 95%CIs, and used Rubin\u2019s formula to pool allestimates across 100 imputed datasets13.For the survival analysis, we restricted analyses to the provinces outside Hubei,considering the completeness of individual records obtained. As mentionedabove, patients were discharged only after testing negative by nucleic aciddetection tests on two consecutive days9. We collected individual information from publiclyavailable official sources on 9,651 laboratory-confirmed cases detected outsideHubei by February 23, accounting for 75.0% (9,651/12,863) of total casesreported, 63.9% (62/97) of deceased patients, 18.2% (1,449/7,973) of recoveredpatients. Those who died were significantlyolder than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). Male patients, older age, and less developed regionswere factors associated with a higher CFR. Our study is strengthened by accounting for unknown outcomes among patients271272273274275276277278279280281282283284285286287288289290291who were still in hospital at time of data cutoff. Survival analysis was a useful tool forcomparison as it relied on a very large individual dataset comprising a total of9,651 reported cases. Instead, wedivided the estimated CFR among all cases by the proportions of different clinicalcategories obtained from the aggregated dataset. In addition, case surveillance and clinicalmanagement were biased towards severe cases in Hubei, especially in the earlyphase of the epidemic. Comparison of clinical data from China and other countries will prove useful tosettle this question. This strategy would have enabled detection of many mild cases. This may vary among countries due to different clinical practices andhealth service capacity. For non-critically ill patients, close follow-up is likely to be sufficient to managethe disease. Our findings can inform the severity assessment and response to theon-going COVID-19 outbreak, and assist preparations for a global epidemic ofH.Y. conceived, designed and supervised the study.
