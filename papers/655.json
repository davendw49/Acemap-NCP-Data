At first the local governments did not takeeffective measures which leaded to local people not paying enough attention to the risk.However, with the epidemic in Wuhan further expanding, the Chinese Governmentstarted to take emergency actions to lock down the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020.Despite this, the epidemic still spread throughout the entire country. By March 12, 2020,controlling the spread of the epidemic has become a global challenge. One of the keyparameters in epidemic models is the basic reproduction number  0, defined as thenumber of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case in a completelysusceptible population [5]. As an infection is spreading through a population, it is moreconvenient to work with an effective reproduction number   , which is defined as thenumber of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case [5]. Themagnitude of   is a useful indicator for evaluating the risk of an infectious diseaseand the validity of controlling the epidemic. If  exceeds 1, the number of incidentcases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent theexpansion of an epidemic,must be reduced to a level below 1. Using the parameter  , one can establish the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) epidemic model asbelow [6-8]: ( ) ( ) ( )( ), ( ) \u2212 ( ),where  ( ),  ( ) and \u211b( ) are the number of susceptible, infectious, and removed(including recovered and death) individuals at time  ;  denotes the generationinterval that is the time from infection of an individual to the infection of a secondarycase by that individual, namely, the \u201ccontagion period\u201d of an infection [5]. Thegeneration interval  should be a random variable. If we denote the number of =If  populations by  , we have:        ( ) +  ( ) + \u211b( ).and  of an epidemic are known, one can employ the SIR model (1)-(4) tosimulate the evolutionary track of this epidemic. To estimate the reproduction number  , the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectiousdisease,  ( ), is required to be available [5, 9-12]; however, this distribution is oftenunknown. In the existing literature, many scholars used exponential distribution [5],normal distribution [5], Weibull distribution [9, 10], and Gamma distribution [3, 12] toapproximate  ( ). Theoretically, to use these distributions to approximate  ( ), oneneeds to know enough information about symptom onsets of all cases, namely, largesample cases for  . Regarding the incomplete information, one also applied theMonteCarlo method [4] and Bayesian statistical inference [11] to estimating  ( ). However,thus far, there is scant literature to discuss the potential application of the maximumentropy method (MaxEnt) [        denotes the maximum symptom duration. Wallinga and Lipsitchassumed [5]= +\u221e. To make the model more realistic, we assume that  a finite number. Thus, the reproduction number   can be defined as [5]:  = \u222b0is(6)( ) = (, ).Substituting equation (7) into equation (6) yields:(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)variance of the generation interval:where  ( ) is the probability distribution function of the generation interval  [5].and  ( ) are known, one can calculate the reproduction number by using equation(11). Generally speaking, the number of infectious individuals  ( ) is reported foreach day, while the function shape of  ( ) is unknown. Therefore, many scholarsused exponential distribution [5], normal distribution [5], Weibull distribution [9, 10]and Gamma distribution [3, 12] to approximate  ( ). To do so, one needs to collectenough information of  , which requires examining a large number of cases. From apractical point of view, it is easier to collect a sample set of cases (at least 30 samples)to calculate the approximate estimates of the mean value \u0305 and the variance  2. Giventhe approximate estimates of \u0305 and  2 as the prior information, we maximize theinformation entropy of the generation interval  to infer the function shape of theprobability distribution  ( ). This is the basic idea of the MaxEnt, which agrees witheverything that is known, but avoids assuming anything that is not known [15]. Theresulting statistical inference gives the least biased predictions of the shapes ofprobability distributions consistent with prior knowledge [23].Now we apply the MaxEnt to determining the probability distribution functionof the generation interval  as:information entropy (12) should yield:Because we only know the mean value \u0305 and the variance  2, maximizing themax  [ ( )] = \u2212 \u222b0 ( ). To this end, we assume that the mean value \u0305 and the variance  2 of thegeneration interval  are known. By equation (8), we define the information entropy(12)(13) ( ) \u2219(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)Theoretically, substituting equation (15) into equations (8), (9), and (10) one cancalculate the values of  ,  , and  . However, it is difficult to obtain the analyticresults of integrals (8), (9) and (10). To do numerical calculation for equations (8), (9),and (10), we assume that  ( ) quickly tends to 0 as  \u226b 1 . The validity of thisassumption can be justified by checking equation (15); therefore, equations (8), (9) and(10) can be written as:Based on equations (16), (17) and (18), we propose a numerical method to calculate ( ) \u2219 ( \u2212 \u0305 )2 \u2212  2),where  \u2032,  , and  are Lagrange multipliers.the optimal solution:where  = exp (\u2212 \u2032 \u2212 1).( ) =  ( |, , ) =  \u2219 exp [\u2212\u2212  ( \u2212 \u0305 )2],Plugging equation (14) into the functional derivative \u2112 [ ( )]\u2044 ( ) = 0 we getthe approximate values of  ,  , and  . To this end, let us order:The partial derivatives of equation (19) with respect to  and  yield:) = \u222b+\u221e0 ( |, ,)  .))= \u2212 \u222b= \u2212 \u222b+\u221e+\u221e00 ( |, ,  ( |, , ) \u2219   ,) \u2219 ( \u2212 \u0305 )2  .Using equations (19), (20) and (21), equations (8), (9) and (10) can be rewritten inthe form: (,, (,,exp(\u2212\u0305 2) [erfc (\u22122 \u03052\u221a) exp ((\u22122 \u0305 )2 \u22122 \u0305)4\u22121\u221a],exp(\u2212\u0305 2) [+2 \u0305\u2212 erfc (2 \u221a\u22122 \u03052\u221a) exp ((\u22122 \u0305 )2  2+2)4 2].(25)24{ (, ,  (,, (,,,where we have used the approximations (16), (17) and (18).By solving equation (22), one can obtain the approximate values of  ,  , and  .\u221a22\u221a\u222bSubstituting equation (15) into equation (19) we have (, , ) =erfc (\u2212 \u0305) exp (\u2212 \u0305) ,2\u221a 24where erfc( ) =\u221eexp(\u2212 2)denotes the error function.By equation (23) it is easy to get:(19)(20)(21)(22)(23)(24)(26)Solving equation (22) is equivalent to minimizing the following function: [, , ] = ( (, , ) \u2212 1)2 + ( (,,+  2 ) .2Here we employ the Matlab software to depict  [, , ] as a 100 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 100lattice-point matrix, where the lattice spacing is 0.01. Given the accuracy of 0.01, byinputting the observed values of \u0305 and  2, we calculate  ,  , and  . We first applyequation (26) to the SARS epidemic in Singapore in 2003, where \u0305 = 8.4 (days) and = 3.8(days) [9]. Substituting both observed values into equation (26), we seek thelattice-point minimizing equation (26) as below:2003, see the red histogram in Figure 1. This result supports the validity of the MaxEnt.The latest clinical research [1] showed that the generation interval of COVID-19 issimilar to that of SARS. Therefore, we assume that the generation interval ofCOVID19 shares the same probability function shape as that of SARS. This assumption wasalso adopted by Wu et al [4]. Based on this assumption, we apply equation (28) toestimating the reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. To this end, substitutingequation (28) into equation (11) we have:Because the observed data of  ( ) was reported for each day, we denote the unitof time  by \u201cday\u201d. To calculate   by using equation (29), we need to rewrite theintegral (29) as a summation formula. To do so, by Figure 1 we observe  ( =14 ) \u22480. By equations (16)-(18), this means  \u2248 14. Therefore, the maximum generationinterval of COVID-19 can be approximately denoted by 14. Based on this setting,equation (29) can be rewritten in the form: =\u2248  (14 )\u2044(\u22111=40  (14 \u2212  )  ( |0.27,0.11,0.04)),where  = 1,2, \u2026denote the ordinal number of the period and  = 14. Withoutloss of generality, in equation (30) we have approximately identified the reproductionnumber of the last day of a period as the reproduction number of this period. From theperspective of entire time span of an epidemic, this approximation satisfies the spirit ofstatistical mean-field method.By using equation (30) we can report the reproduction number every 14 days.Before doing so, we first determine the starting point of each contagion period forCOVID-19 in China. According to the report of China CDC [2], January 8, 2020 wasconsidered as the last day of a contagion period in Wuhan, China; therefore, we markJanuary 9, 2020 as the first day of the next contagion period. Based on this setting, thefirst period we report is from January 9, 2020 to January 22, 2020. In fact, this settingagrees with the date of locking down the Wuhan city, January 23, 2020. Here, we havecollected the national-level data of the accumulative infected, recovered, and deathcases of China\u2019s epidemic from January 10, 2020 to March 4, 2020, see Figure 2. Byusing the data in Figure 2, it is easy to calculate the number of real-time infected cases, ( ), in China for each day. This result has been shown in Figure 3. Using the data inThe results have been listed in Table 1. The first period (from January 9, 2020 to January22, 2020) can be regarded as a free propagation stage of COVID-19 because mostChinese people were aware of the outbreak of COVID-19 after January 21, 2020 andlocal governments did not take effective measures to control the epidemic during thisperiod. Unfortunately, the data in the first period is very incomplete. By contrast, thereported infected cases on January 10 (41 cases) and January 22 (571 cases) can beroughly used. Consider that the first period is a free propagation stage, we use both datato approximately restore real-time data of this period by the exponential growth formula571 = 41 \u2219 exp(12 \u2219  ), where  denotes the growth rate. Using the restored data, theestimated value of the reproduction number for the first period is calculated to be 3.7069,see Table 1, which implies that the intensity of free transmission of COVID-19 is quitehigh. The World Health Organization announced [27], up to March 12, 2020, theCOVID-19 had spread to 118 countries. The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 isan evidence for supporting our calculation. After January 22, 2020, ChineseGovernment started to take emergency actions to lock down the Wuhan city, andquickly performed different quarantine measures in every provinces. The powerfulquarantine measures substantially reduce the contagion probability among individuals.Therefore, the subsequent periods no longer belong to free transmission. For theseperiods, the results of the reproduction number have been listed in Table 1. Due to thequarantine measures, the reproduction number for the second period (from January 23,2020 to February 5, 2020) has been reduced to 3.122 with the reduction amplitude beingreproduction number has remarkably been reduced to 1.2114, which is close to 1. Thisimplies that the epidemic has been effectively controlled. It should be pointed out thatthe last day of the third period (February 19) is just the turning point of the epidemic,refer to Figure 3; therefore, the real data supports our calculations for the reproductionnumber. As the epidemic come to the fourth period (from February 20, 2020 to March4, 2020), the reproduction number is eventually reduced to 0.6028, a level below 1. Inthis sense, China\u2019s quarantine measures have obtained a preliminary success.To further test the validity of the reproduction numbers in Table 1, we substitutethem into the SIR model (1)-(4) for simulating the evolution of China\u2019s epidemic. Tothis end, let us first check the scope of application of the reproduction number formula(11), which is derived by equation (5). By the mean value theorem of integrals, equation(5) can be rewritten in the form:which implies (  ) \u2248 (0)\u2219  (0) \u2219   \u2248  (0) \u2219    , ( ( )\u2212 (0) (0)where 0 \u2264   \u2264 period, by equations (1)-(4) it is easy to get: ( ) =  (0) +  (0) \u2212  ( ) + ln()(0).\u2248 (0)\u2212 ( ) (0)\u226a 1.On the other hand, if we assume that  is a constant (step function) for eachBy using equation (34), equation (33) can be approximately written as: ( ) \u2248  (0) +  (0) \u2212  ( ) +) \u2248  (0) +  ( ) \u2212  ( )   (0)(34)(35)(36)where equation (35) is derived by using the approximations |  \u2212 1| \u2219 \u211b( ) \u226a  ( )and  (0) \u2248  .Comparing equations (32) and (36), we find that the reproduction number formula(11) can be applied to the SIR model (1)-(4) if the approximation (34) holds. Equation(34) implies ( \u2212( ))/ \u226a 1 . The approximation obviously holds for China, where \u2248 1.4 \u00d7109 and  \u2212( ) \u2248 1 \u00d7 105. Therefore, we substitute the reproductionnumbers in Table 1 into the SIR model (1)-(4) to simulate the evolution of China\u2019sepidemic. The result is shown by Figure 5, where the evolutionary track (red circles) ofthe epidemic is well in accordance with that (black circles) of the real incident cases inChina. The simulation result requires  \u2248 8 , which agrees with our previous setting = 8.4 \u00b1 3.8 [9]. Furthermore, we find that the reproduction numbers of quarantineperiods in Table 1 can be fitted by an exponential function with  2 = 0.9924, seenumbers for the next seven periods (from March 5, 2020 to June 10, 2020). The resultshave been listed in Table 2, where we also present the predicted values of the numberof real-time infected cases for the last day in each period. These predicted values implythat China\u2019s epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020, see the blue circlesin Figure 5.In conclusion, to estimate the reproduction number, the probability distributionfunction of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available;however, this distribution is often unknown. In the existing literature, many scholarsused exponential distribution, normal distribution, Weibull distribution, and Gammadistribution to approximate the generation interval distribution. To do so, one needs tocollect enough information about symptom onsets of all cases, which requiresexamining a large number of cases. By contrast, the maximum entropy method hasmore advantage of predicting probability distributions given the incompleteinformation. In this letter, we argue that, given the mean value and variance of thegeneration interval, one can determine its probability distribution function by usingmaximum entropy method. Because the overall data (population) of the generationinterval is always absent, the maximum entropy method is a more convenient approachfor estimating the probability distribution function of generation interval. By themaximum entropy method we first determine the probability distribution function ofgeneration interval of COVID-19 and further apply it to estimating the real-time valuesof reproduction numbers of China\u2019s epidemic. Plugging these estimated reproductionnumbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate theevolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that ofthe real incident cases.[1].
