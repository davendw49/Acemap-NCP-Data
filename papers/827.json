However, its eefctiveness will beinuflenced by the initial experience and preparedness ofthe health-care system.6 Although there are observationaldata on the use of rescue ECMO during previousoutbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, mainly in thecontext of inuflenza A(H1N1) ARDS, the real need forECMO during such outbreaks is unclear. For reference,the incidence of ECMO use in patients with 2009inuflenza A(H1N1) ARDS in Australia and New Zealandwas estimated to be 2\u00b76 cases per million, whereas 5\u00b78%of the critically ill patients in Saudi Arabia were supportedwith ECMO for Middle East respiratory syndromecoronavirus-related ARDS.7,8 Therefore, the overall impactof the COVID-19 outbreak on potential ECMO use iscurrently unclear, but there could be an increased need forECMO worldwide.This outbreak is occurring at a time when worldwideECMO infrastructure and resources for education9 andresearch10 are considerably more evolved and organisedthan they were a decade ago. Most importantly, there isnow substantially more evidence to support the ecfiacyand safety of ECMO in patients with ARDS than duringECMO centres should maintain a dedicated manifest ofall members of their multidisciplinary team who are10500Adult Intensive Care Services, specifically trained in the care of patients receivingThe Prince Charles Hospital, ECMO.

As supply chains might becompromised by excessive demand, the componentsessential to operating an ECMO service should be centrallycoordinated. However, individual centres must focus onconservation of scarce supplies to ensure readiness incase of surges in demand and to support neighbouringhospitals. This strategy will require frequent reporting bycentres to the local or regional organising body.In the event that ECMO centres exceed their capacity, alist of regional expert centres with contact details anddirections that clearly delineate arrival areas withadequate infection control precautions should be readilyavailable. All ECMO centres should identify keyratelimiting factors to target in the event of a surge indemand with respect to the four key categories ofresource allocation (figure 2). It is probable that when allresources are stretched during an outbreak, the use ofECMO might be reconsidered and available resourcestargeted at caring for more patients with interventionsthat are less resource-intensive.6 Expert centres mightconsider ofering ECMO services to less experiencedcentres by sending in a satellite team or usingtelemedicine24 until resources are re-established in the expertcentre. A regional plan for monitoring available beds andsupplies could assist in coordinating the distribution oftransported patients to avoid overloading a referral site.For decisions involving resource allocation and complexinter-hospital transfers, a local and regional ECMOcoordinator could help to strengthen this model of care.The chain of command for dealing with high demand inevery ECMO centre should be established and widelypublicised with clear instructions, allocated roles, andappropriate simulation drills.25 The ECMO director wouldlead the team in managing patients receiving ECMO at aninstitutional level. The director should also identify teamsof doctors, perfusionists, nurses, respiratory therapists,and physiotherapists who can be rostered in groupsafter ECMO has been initiated. Multidisciplinary teaminvolvement with an infectious disease specialist should beseen as a minimum requirement to further patientmanagement, given the need for subspecialty knowledgeregarding testing, monitoring, therapeutics, andcontainment.26 We recommend that ECMO centres formulate aminimum and an ideal stanfig requirement andcommunicate them to the local, regional, and nationalnetworks to facilitate stanfig allocation in case ECMOteam members become ill or otherwise unavailable.A dedicated ECMO team should care for all patients, butongoing training to increase the number of stafmembers with less experience should be encouragedwhenever safe and feasible. This approach hastwo advantages: preventing burnout in the short termand improving preparation for future pandemics.Globally, technicians and biomedical engineers couldalso participate in such teams. As part of the clinicalinterdisciplinary team, a surgeon or clinician with anextended skillset (eg, experienced intensivist withcannulation skills) could be involved to enhance thesafety and success of cannulation while reducing theincidence of vascular complications on decannulation.Personnel training is essential to ensure preparednessand success in dealing with a pandemic. Ensuring stafsafety must be a high institutional priority.

Apart fromECMO-specicfi training, team members should becomefamiliar with general intensive-care managementpractices (largely supportive)26\u201329 of infected patients duringan outbreak. Training programmes should be led byexpert members of the ECMO team, with support fromother specialised staf (eg, infection control), andformulated into guidelines for clinical management; suchguidelines should be made available to all members of theECMO team. All ECMO team members should beeducated on the eligibility criteria of patients withemerging infectious diseases to receive ECMO support.From the reported clinical characteristics of patients withCOVID-19 thus far,2,30,31 patient selection and the decisionto initiate ECMO can be based on established criteria,such as those for severe ARDS from other causes.20,32The correct use of personal protection devices andhandling of infected bodily secretions and laboratoryspecimens are essential skills to empower health-careworkers and all other institutional staf to manage anypandemic. After adequate PPE training, use of allECMOrelated equipment must be practiced as a team in ahighifdelity simulation environment while wearing PPE orPAPR. Practice scenarios should simulate critical eventsthat might be stressful even without added burdens suchas accidental decannulation, pump failure, air in thecircuit, and cardiac arrest.

Since verbal communication, peripheral vision,and vision clarity through a respirator lens or face shieldare impaired, simulation training should also ensure thatthese nuances are not experienced for the first time at thebedside.Although ECMO can be a viable rescue strategy forsome patients,32 it is not a substitute for optimalconventional ARDS management. Typically, thismanagement includes ventilation with low tidal volumesand at least moderate positive end-expiratory pressure,while restricting plateau airway and driving pressures,33and accepting some hypercapnia. This strategy caninclude a neuromuscular blockade and should alwaysinclude prone positioning unless contraindicated ortechnically unfeasible. Some patients can be consideredtoo unstable for prone positioning and might have to beadministered rescue ECMO expeditiously if possible.Equally, in unstable patients and in patients who arelikely to deteriorate during transfer, ECMO can be used tofacilitate safe transport from a non-expert centre to anexpert centre.34 All infection control and personalprotection measures should be followed when ECMO isbeing initiated for a patient in extremis, as suchuncontrolled situations can put team members at highrisk of exposure to pathogens.Once the patient is safely administered ECMO, it isimportant to ensure that an ultra-protective mechanicalventilation strategy is used.11,35,36 There is no consensus onthe most appropriate ventilatory strategy for ECMO. Tworandomised trials of ventilation during ECMO for patientswith ARDS (EOLIA;11 plateau pressure of \u226424 cm H2Owhile applying a positive end-expiratory pressure of atleast 10 cm H2O; respiratory rate of 10\u201330 breaths per min)and conventional ventilatory support versus ECMO forsevere adult respiratory failure (CESAR;37 peak inspiratorypressure 20\u201325 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure10 cm H2O; respiratory rate of 10 breaths per min) couldserve as useful guides pending further evidence onventilation strategies for ECMO in patients with ARDS.Prone positioning could be considered during ECMO,although there are few data to support this practice.38The benetfis of ECMO for ARDS largely stem from itsability to confer lung protection, which is associated withdecreased adverse outcomes. It should be noted thatalthough extracorporeal CO2 removal for lung-protectiveventilation is feasible, it is neither evidence-based nor is ituniversally available.39 Occasionally, patients developconcomitant or discrete cardiac failure\u2014mainly frommyocarditis, myocardial infarction, or sepsis-relatedcardiomyopathy\u2014and might need venoarterial ECMO.Provision of ECMO in the setting of both pulmonary andcardiac dysfunction is particularly complex and, wherepossible, requires close liaison with an expertextracorporeal life support centre before ECMO initiation.ECMO-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR)can be considered in carefully selected patients whodevelop cardiac arrest. However, given the likelihood ofpoor outcomes and the considerable risk of infection tostaf responding to these patients, ECPR should beundertaken with great caution.Routine use of steroids is not recommended on thebasis of data from influenza studies that suggestpotential harm.40,41 Although the usefulness of antiviralmedications in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak isunclear, an understanding of altered pharmacokineticsand pharmacodynamics during ECMO42,43 will enableoptimal dosing of antiviral drugs.Frequent ECMO simulation exercises should also beconsidered outside a state of emergency to develop andreinforce cannulation skills, deal with circuit or pumpemergencies, and practise other troubleshooting exercisesall with PPE or PAPR donned.Infection control precautions are essential to preventfurther spread of emerging infectious diseases and tokeep the treating team, other patients, and familymembers safe.8 Areas of increased precaution should beclearly marked and visual and audio guidance (wherepossible) should be provided to staf trying to enter theseareas. Pre-existing security measures must be maintained(eg, swipe card and code access), and mask users mustalways check the seals before entry into any patient area.Additional security personnel to ensure staf and patientsafety in what can be a dificult and emotionally chargedenvironment might be necessary. The stations forpersonal protection devices must be strategically placedto enhance compliance.WHO recommends that health-care workersperforming aerosol-generating procedures such as endotrachealintubation and bronchoscopy should do them in anadequately ventilated room\u2014ie, with natural ventilation(airflow of at least 160 L/s per patient) or innegativepressure rooms (at least 12 air changes per h). Whenusing mechanical ventilation devices, a controlleddirection of airflow is required. Use of N95 or Fluid/FirmParticle-2 masks is essential and previous fit-testing isdesirable.44ECMO centres should revisit their existing infectioncontrol guidelines and protocols and ensure that allmembers of the ECMO team receive adequate training.44,45If ECMO needs to be initiated at another health centre,the team should either carry the PPE or PAPR resourceswith them or be familiar with using equipment at anotherhospital. Personnel performing ECMO cannulation mustwear sterile attire in addition to personal protectiondevices.To reduce the infection control resources required totransport highly contagious patients receiving ECMO,ECMO centres should consider developing facility-levelplans to group such patients.46 It would be desirable tohave harmonised infection-control practices in regionalhospitals so that ECMO teams are used to a standardisedapproach to personal protection devices.Expert centres should devise eligibility criteria (specicfi tothe current outbreak) for inter-hospital transfer and sharethem with referral centres. An experienced ECMOclinician should evaluate referrals and enact retrievalplans as required. If the rapidity of disease progressionfrom dyspnoea to ARDS is short or unknown, werecommend early transfer (eg, after tracheal intubation)to an ECMO centre, if feasible. If ECMO needs to beinitiated in a peripheral hospital, the ECMO team shouldbe aware of the local resources and make a concertedeofrt not to deplete their supplies. Guidance for preparingthe patient and the area for cannulation on the team\u2019sarrival should be forwarded to the local hospital to shortenturnaround time. Any rate-limiting steps should beidentiefid early by a dedicated ECMO retrieval coordinator.Eefctive communication and coordination will be crucialfor a successful and ecfiient interhospital transfer. 47Declined referrals should be clearly communicated to thetreating team.Patients receiving ECMO might also requiretransportation within the same institution to the radiology suite,cardiac catheterisation laboratory, or operating room. Therisk-benetfi prolfie of all transports must include thepossibility of disease dissemination to health-care workersand the public. This risk should be meticulously assessedbefore ECMO is initiated. Strict continuous adherence toinfection control policies is required, with immediatedisinfection of the route and transport vehicles, to preventand reduce the risk of cross-contamination.The natural history of COVID-19 pneumonia and themedian time to resolution are currently unknown. AllECMO centres should have standardised ECMO weaningprotocols,48,49 and team members should be trainedaccordingly. A successful weaning trial should be accompaniedby decannulation, and further rehabilitation should followstrict infection control measures with use of PPE orPAPR. Ambulation of the patient outside thenegativepressure room might not be possible as long as the patientis infectious. Follow-up of such patients is important toensure that their long-term outcomes are acceptable.50Weaning and decannulation simulation drills using PPEand PAPR should be considered. Possible exit strategies,including maintaining ECMO until recovery,transplantation, or palliation, should be actively deliberated inthe event of a requirement for prolonged ECMO, andoptions should be based on a realistic understanding ofavailable resources.Until further evidence is available, all deceased patientsshould be treated as infectious and appropriate precautionsadopted. Storage capacities of mortuary facilities in ECMOcentres should be mapped, and guidelines forpostmortem care reviewed.51 Decannulation of the deceased ifthey were treated with ECMO might carry a stronginfection risk and should be done while wearing PPE andPAPR. Waste should be disposed of following nationaland international guidelines on disposal of infectiousbiological hazardous materials.Flowcharts for post-mortem management of patientswith COVID-19 following ECMO decannulation shouldbe considered. Such flowcharts should include certification of death, notification of health authorities,and appropriate wrapping of the body. The bodyhandlers and the immediate family members shouldtake infection control precautions.Members of the ECMO team should be frequentlymonitored for their health and wellbeing, given the riskof infection transmission to health-care providers.Moderate-to-high staf attrition rates as a result ofincreased psychological stress should be anticipated andameliorated with provision of stress management andpsychosocial support for team members.51 Amultidisciplinary team of trained psychiatrists, psychologists,social workers, or psychiatric nurses would be ideal tomonitor and treat afected staf. A psychiatric hotlinecould be made available to staf members in need ofurgent attention.52 Centres need to review policies tomanage and retain staf trained in ECMO, includinginsurance, incentives, sick leave, and occupational healthand safety.Personnel who show symptoms of infection should bequarantined for a duration based on the maximalincubation period of the infection (eg, 2 weeks), with aclear follow-up and escalation plan in place if theircondition deteriorates. Additionally, protocols forcontacttracing of all non-infected patients who have been caredfor by an infected staf member must be available.Workplace policies for management of staf wellbeing,including ensuring the presence of staf support servicesto provide basic amenities, such as meals and drinks,showering facilities, rest areas, and a laundry service forused scrubs or uniforms, could be introduced. Trainingof staf not specialised in ECMO should be considered tofurther support crucial roles in the ECMO teams (eg,credentialling of nurses).16,51 Institutions might considersegregating teams treating highly infectious patientsreceiving ECMO from other patients in the intensivecare unit so that they can function independently of eachother to prevent cross-infection. Enhanced use ofteleplatforms for meetings and cancellation of educationaland recreational activities that bring large groups offrontline staf together should also be considered.Protection of junior and inexperienced staf frominvolvement in the management of such highlyinfectious patients in the initial stages of the outbreak isusually possible. However, if an outbreak escalatesrapidly, their participation might be necessary, andfasttrack training programmes should be devised to ensurereadiness in this instance.Ethical challenges53\u201355 will aefct decision making whenoefring ECMO therapy in an outbreak. There might beuncertainties regarding the potential benetfi and durationof ECMO in this context, which might be dynamic as theoutbreak evolves and would require regular review. Allaspects of a patient\u2019s treatment plan should be regularlyreviewed, including the need to continue or terminateECMO. The decision to stop treatment should not bemade purely on the basis of duration of ECMO therapybut only after achieving consensus within the treatingteam that the patient has minimal potential to recover.Unprecedented situations, such as too few ECMOmachines, might necessitate rationing of ECMO servicesand should involve predetermined consensus criteriaformulated to empower clinicians during times of crisiswhile upholding distributive justice. Distributive justice isonly invoked in circumstances in which rationingprecludes the ability to care for each individual optimally.56Appropriate opinions from hospital ethics, social work,and medicolegal committees might be required inethically challenging scenarios.57,58Shared decision making with family members on aspectsof ECMO initiation, continuation, and terminationwould be desirable. Surrogate decision makersconsenting to ECMO do so at a time of high stress related tothe disease severity. The involvement of social workersand ethics committee members might help to alleviatesome of the ethical hurdles encountered during themanagement of a patient receiving ECMO in suchhighpressure settings.57Quality assurance and clinical governance frameworksmust be maintained, and ECMO quality reviewedfrequently, to measure overall outcomes of ECMOadministration, identify problems, and formulate plansfor corrective actions. Validated quality metrics specificto ECMO use during outbreaks of emerging infectiousdiseases are yet to be developed. Lessons learned frommanagement of previous such outbreaks might help toclose any gaps in preparedness once they have beenidentified or to define a consistent approach forimproving quality of ECMO delivery. Collection andsharing of data are important to ensure preparednessand patient care, especially in parts of the world thathave not yet been afected by the outbreak. The ELSOregistry that currently collects de-identified patient dataon indication, demography, and haemodynamic andbiochemical variables before and after initiating ECMO,as well as details of patient outcomes and complicationsfrom more than 400 ECMO centres worldwide, can be auseful resource during an outbreak of an infectiousdisease, and modifications to existing data collection (eg,information specific to COVID-19 such as swabbingdetails or cycle threshold values for PCR) might providevaluable data for quality assurance and research.Research during outbreaks of emerging infectiousdiseases can be further facilitated by global researchcollaborations, such as the International ECMONetwork, International Severe Acute Respiratory andEmerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), and theExtracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for 2019 novelCoronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (ECMOCARD)collaborative. Having research proposals with ethicsapproval in place or developing pathways for anexpedient ethics review and approval are highly desirableto generate and disseminate knowledge that can benefitpatients globally.Periodic outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, suchas COVID-19, are now becoming inevitable in our wellconnected world. Such global outbreaks demand astrategic global response. Given the propensity of theseemerging infections to rapidly cause severe respiratoryfailure in many patients and, in the case of COVID-19, thehigh transmission rate of the virus and unclear overallcase-fatality rate, the critical care response should be partof a larger pandemic plan to reduce transmission andprevent deaths. These preparations for the COVID-19outbreak should involve the provision of ECMO insucfiiently resourced settings. Careful patient selectionfor ECMO is needed because patient age andcomorbidities appear to inuflence outcomes in criticallyill patients with COVID-19. Moreover, several variables,such as reversibility of the pulmonary disease process,risk of secondary pulmonary infections, and the role ofantiviral drugs and other disease-modifying factors,might aefct outcomes with ECMO. In addition to carefulpatient selection, strict adherence to standard intensivecare management practices and infection controlprotocols should be among the primary goals of care.Outside infectious disease outbreaks, ECMO forARDS is an evidence-based, yet resource-intensive,infrequently used service that is typically available onlyat specialised centres. Although many new centres havebeen created and ECMO retrieval services are nowincreasingly available, access to ECMO is restricted,especially in resource-poor settings. Establishinghuband-spoke models20,21 of care, in which severely illpatients who are eligible for high-end intensive caresupport including ECMO are managed at the hub mightenable improved stratification of critically ill patients.Well established ECMO retrieval programmes will be animportant resource if patients deteriorate in regionalcentres. Building sustainable systems that can be usedto rapidly transfer and group high numbers of criticallyill patients would be important to provide high-qualityECMO care during outbreaks of emerging infectiousdiseases such as COVID-19.Furthermore, much needs to be done through globalcollaboration to contain the disease and to prioritisevaccine production to alter the natural history ofthe pathogen.

A contemporaneous log of machines servicedHealMthetSreorvNicoer,thBrHisobsapnitea,lQaLnDd, and ready to deploy should be maintained. QLD 4032, Australiakiran.shekar@health.qld.gov.auFor the Extracorporeal LifeSupport Organization seehttps://www.elso.orgClustering patients with COVID-19 requiring ECMOwithin an expert centre should be considered for ease ofresource management.22 It would be desirable to have aregional outbreak response system that stratiefis theextent of the disease spread, the risk of extendedtransmission, and the eefct on the wider community 23 toallow hospital authorities to allocate appropriate resourcesand reduce elective services and admissions within asuitable timeframe. However, individual centres must focus onconservation of scarce supplies to ensure readiness incase of surges in demand and to support neighbouringhospitals. This approach hastwo advantages: preventing burnout in the short termand improving preparation for future pandemics. Globally, technicians and biomedical engineers couldalso participate in such teams. Since verbal communication, peripheral vision,and vision clarity through a respirator lens or face shieldare impaired, simulation training should also ensure thatthese nuances are not experienced for the first time at thebedside. The stations forpersonal protection devices must be strategically placedto enhance compliance. Use of N95 or Fluid/FirmParticle-2 masks is essential and previous fit-testing isdesirable.44ECMO centres should revisit their existing infectioncontrol guidelines and protocols and ensure that allmembers of the ECMO team receive adequate training.44,45If ECMO needs to be initiated at another health centre,the team should either carry the PPE or PAPR resourceswith them or be familiar with using equipment at anotherhospital. Personnel performing ECMO cannulation mustwear sterile attire in addition to personal protectiondevices. Expert centres should devise eligibility criteria (specicfi tothe current outbreak) for inter-hospital transfer and sharethem with referral centres. An experienced ECMOclinician should evaluate referrals and enact retrievalplans as required. Any rate-limiting steps should beidentiefid early by a dedicated ECMO retrieval coordinator. Eefctive communication and coordination will be crucialfor a successful and ecfiient interhospital transfer. AllECMO centres should have standardised ECMO weaningprotocols,48,49 and team members should be trainedaccordingly. Until further evidence is available, all deceased patientsshould be treated as infectious and appropriate precautionsadopted. Waste should be disposed of following nationaland international guidelines on disposal of infectiousbiological hazardous materials. Additionally, protocols forcontacttracing of all non-infected patients who have been caredfor by an infected staf member must be available. Enhanced use ofteleplatforms for meetings and cancellation of educationaland recreational activities that bring large groups offrontline staf together should also be considered. However, if an outbreak escalatesrapidly, their participation might be necessary, andfasttrack training programmes should be devised to ensurereadiness in this instance. Unprecedented situations, such as too few ECMOmachines, might necessitate rationing of ECMO servicesand should involve predetermined consensus criteriaformulated to empower clinicians during times of crisiswhile upholding distributive justice. Lessons learned frommanagement of previous such outbreaks might help toclose any gaps in preparedness once they have beenidentified or to define a consistent approach forimproving quality of ECMO delivery.
