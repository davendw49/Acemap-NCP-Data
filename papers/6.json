Processing and visualization of single cell RNA-seq dataThe downloaded unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrix was converted toSeurat object using the R package Seurat v.3.1.1.[                Cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interfacePlacenta and decidua are the main maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy, andvirus receptor ACE2 expression in placenta and decidual cells may play importantrole in promoting transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained single celltranscriptome data sequenced by 10X Genomics of early placenta (6~14 gestationalweeks) containing ~65,000 cells [                  As the essential elements of virus transmission, the expression of virus receptor ACE2in target organs is another determining factor for fetus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.We then screened the ACE2 expression in multiple fetal organs including heart, lungs,liver and kidneys based on the online published single cell transcriptome studies. In afetal heart single cell study covering early to late fetal stages[                    Since the respiratory system undergoes a series of structural and functional changesnecessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth, and lung is a major organ to beattacked by SARS-CoV-2 virus, the dynamic changes of pulmonary cells geneexpression is necessary to be investigated before and after birth to predict thepotential infection of fetal and neonatal individuals. Because atlas of human fetal lungis unavailable, we obtained mouse lung cell atlas from late pregnancy (E16.5, E18.5)to post-natal day (PND) 28 (Figure 3A).[                  As the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues, pregnant women may under high risks ofaffection due to under an immunosuppressive state and the affection status of mothersmay cause adverse maternal and neonatal complications and outcomes.[        This study demonstrates the expression of ACE2 in human maternal-fetal interfaceand the main fetal organs which indicates the potential factors for the infection ofSARS-CoV-2 to the fetus through the vertical transmission on the cellular level.This work was supported by the Project funded by China Postdoctoral ScienceFoundation and was also supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China(81872673).This study was conceived of and led by X.L..
