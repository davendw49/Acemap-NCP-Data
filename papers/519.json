OBJECTIVE To report the initial experience in Singapore with the epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak, clinical features, and management. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Descriptive case series of the first 18 patients diagnosed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at 4 hospitals in Singapore from January 23 to February 3, 2020; final follow-up date was February 25, 2020. EXPOSURES Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including PCR cycle threshold values from nasopharyngeal swabs and viral shedding in blood, urine, and stool. Clinical course was summarized, including requirement for supplemental oxygen and intensive care and use of empirical treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir. RESULTS Among the 18 hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age, 47 years; 9 [50%] women), clinical presentation was an upper respiratory tract infection in 12 (67%), and viral shedding from the nasopharynx was prolonged for 7 days or longer among 15 (83%). Six individuals (33%) required supplemental oxygen; of these, 2 required intensive care. There were no deaths. Virus was detectable in the stool (4/8 [50%]) and blood (1/12 [8%]) by PCR but not in urine. Five individuals requiring supplemental oxygen were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir. For 3 of the 5 patients, fever resolved and supplemental oxygen requirement was reduced within 3 days, whereas 2 deteriorated with progressive respiratory failure. Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir developed nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developed abnormal liver function test results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among the first 18 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore, clinical presentation was frequently a mild respiratory tract infection. Some patients required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent.", "type": "Original Investigation", "text": "T Wuhan, China, in December 2019.1 Phylogenetics hashe third novel coronavirus in 17 years emerged inindicated that severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is closely related to bat-derivedSARSlike coronaviruses.2 Early reports from Wuhan described theassociated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as aSARSlike atypical pneumonia in which 26% to 33% of patientsrequired intensive care and 4% to 15% died.1,3,4 A large caseseries of 72 314 infected individuals has since refined these initialestimates in China to severe disease in 14% and a case-fatalityrate of 2.3%.5        On January 2        While a proven effective antiviral treatment in COVID-19 isnot available, the antiretroviral drug lopinavir-ritonavir has beenproposed, as its potential effectiveness in the treatment of SARSwas suggested in 2 case series.7,8 In Middle East respiratorysyndrome, lopinavir-ritonavir also showed potential activity inmarmosets,9 but in a mouse model it did not reduce virus titeror lung pathology, although it improved lung function.10This case series describes the epidemiologic features,clinical presentation, treatment, and outcomes of the first 18patients in Singapore with confirmed COVID-19.On January 2, 2020, after first reports of an outbreak ofatypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China, the Singapore Ministry ofHealth issued a health alert that patients with pneumonia andrecent travel to Hubei Province should be screened forSARSCoV-2 infection. All individuals with suspected SARS-CoV-2infection were isolated with airborne and contact precautions,and attending staff wore personal protective equipment inaccordance with the US Centers for Disease Control andPrevention guidelines.11 Extensive contact tracing followed byquarantine of asymptomatic contacts and hospital isolation andscreening of symptomatic contacts was strictly enforced.Individuals confirmed to have COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) were eligible for inclusion in this study (eMethodsin the Supplement). Data were collected at the 4 hospitals thatprovided care for these patients.Waiver of informed consent for collection of clinical datafrom infected individuals was granted by the Ministry ofHealth, Singapore, under the Infectious Diseases Act as partof the COVID-19 outbreak investigation. Written informedconsent was obtained from study participants for collectionof biological samples after review and approval of the studyprotocol by the institutional ethics committee.Data from electronic health records were summarizedusing a standardized data collection form. Two researchersindependently reviewed the data collection forms for accuracy.Key Pointsdiagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Singapore betweenrespiratory tract infection with prolonged viral shedding from thenasopharynx of 7 days or longer in 15 patients (83%).among patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection inSpecimens (blood, stool, and urine samples;nasopharyngeal swabs) were collected at multiple time points in thefirst 2 weeks following study enrollment and tested byRT-PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR cyclethreshold values were collected. The cycle threshold valuecorrelates with the number of copies of the virus in abiological sample, in an inversely proportional and exponentialmanner. Sequencing of PCR products of the RNA-dependentRNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were used to constructphylogenetic trees (eMethods in the Supplement).As part of standard of care, complete blood cell count, testsof kidney and liver function, and measurement of C-reactiveprotein and lactate dehydrogenase levels were performed.Respiratory samples were tested for influenza and otherrespiratory viruses with a multiplex PCR assay.All patients received supportive therapy, includingsupplemental oxygen when saturations as measured by pulseoximeter dropped below 92%. Patients clinically suspected ofhaving community-acquired pneumonia were administeredempirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and oral oseltamivir.Coformulated lopinavir-ritonavir (200 mg/100 mg twicedaily orally for up to 14 days) was prescribed to selectedpatients at the treating physicians\u2019 discretion after shareddecision-making and provision of oral informed consent.Corticosteroids were avoided, reflecting increased mortalitywith their use in severe influenza.12Respiratory samples were sent daily for SARS-CoV-2PCR on clinical recovery. Deisolation was contingent on atleast 2 consecutive negative PCR assay results more than24 hours apart.          Between January 23 and February          Clinical features are summarized in the Table. Fever (13[72%]), cough (15 [83%]), and sore throat (11 [61%]) werecommon symptoms. Rhinorrhea was infrequent (1 [6%]), while 6patients (33%) had an abnormal chest radiograph finding orlung crepitations. No patients presented with a severe acuterespiratory distress syndrome, and only 1 requiredimmediate supplemental oxygen. Lymphopenia (<1.1 \u00d7109/L) waspresent in 7 of 16 patients (39%) and an elevated C-reactiveprotein level (>20 mg/L) in 6 of 16 (38%), while kidneyfunction remained normal.          The clinical course was uncomplicated for 12 patients(67%), but 6 patients (33%) desaturated and requiredsupplemental oxygen (Figure 1). Chest radiographs showed nopulmonary opacities at presentation in 12 patients (67%)and remained clear throughout the acute illness in 9 (50%).Three patients with initially normal chest radiographfindings developed bilateral diffuse airspace opacities; of these,2 had been persistently febrile for more than 1 week. Twoindividuals (11%) required admission to the intensive careunit because of increasing supplemental oxygenrequirements, and 1 (6%) required mechanical ventilation. Noconcomitant bacterial or viral infections were detected, andthere were no deaths as of February 2                    Of the 6 patients who required supplemental oxygen, 5received lopinavir-ritonavir (Figure 2). For 3 of 5 patients (60%),(Reprinted) JAMA Published online March          Two patients, however, deteriorated and experiencedprogressive respiratory failure while receivinglopinavirritonavir, with 1 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.Virus continued to be detected by nasopharyngeal swab orendotracheal tube aspirate for these 2 patients for theduration of their admission to intensive care.Four of the 5 patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavirdeveloped nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, and 3 developedabnormal liver function test results. Only 1 individualcompleted the planned 14-day treatment course as a result of theseadverse events.Median duration of viral shedding from first to last positivenasopharyngeal swab collected as part of clinical care was12 days (range, 1-24), and 15 patients (83%) had viralshedding from the nasopharynx detected for 7 days or longer.Daily serial RT-PCR cycle threshold values for all 18 patientsare shown in eFigure 3 in the Supplement. The time courseof serial cycle threshold values by day of illness for 12patients not receiving supplemental oxygen and 6 patientsreceiving supplemental oxygen (of whom 5 were treatedwith lopinavir-ritonavir) appeared similar (eFigure 4 in theSupplement).Virus was detected by PCR in stool (4/8 patients [50%])and in whole blood (1/12 [8%]); virus was not detected inurine (0/10 samples) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). ViralE4jama.comculture results were not available at the time of writing todetermine the viability of virus detected outside therespiratory tract.Sequences for phylogenetic analysis were available for 6viruses (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). All clustered togetherwith other SARS-CoV-2 sequences reported from China andother countries and are available in public databases.This descriptive case series reports the clinical features of thefirst 18 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2infection in Singapore, reporting epidemiologic features andclinical course in detail.Perhaps reflecting the intensive efforts at contacttracing, 28% of patients were without fever vs 1.4% to 17% in 3previously reported studies from Wuhan, China.1,4,13 In thecurrent study, 6 of 18 patients (33%) experienced oxygendesaturation to 92% or less, in contrast to the 76% to 90%supplemental oxygen use from the other 3 studies.1,4,13          In 4 of 8 patients, virus was detected in stool, regardlessof diarrhea, over 1 to 7 days.
