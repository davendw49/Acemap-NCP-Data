It hassince been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus, similar to SARScoronavirus and MERS coronavirus and named COVID-19. Asof        Here we review the basic reproduction number (R0) of theCOVID-19 virus. R0 is an indication of the transmissibility of avirus, representing the average number of new infectionsgenerated by an infectious person in a totally na\u00efve population. ForR0 > 1, the number infected is likely to increase, and for R0 < 1,transmission is likely to die out. The basic reproduction numberis a central concept in infectious disease epidemiology, indicatingthe risk of an infectious agent with respect to epidemic spread.        PubMed, bioRxiv and Google Scholar were accessed to searchfor eligible studies. The term \u2018coronavirus & basic reproductionnumber\u2019 was used. The time period covered was from        The first studies initially reported estimates of R0 withlower values. Estimations subsequently increased and then againreturned in the most recent estimates to the levels initiallyreported (Figure 1). A closer look reveals that the estimationmethod used played a role.The two studies using stochastic methods to estimate R0,reported a range of 2.2\u20132.68 with an average of 2.44.1, 9 The sixstudies using mathematical methods to estimate R0 produced arange from 1.5 to 6.49, with an average of 4.2.2, 4\u20136, 8, 10 The threestudies using statistical methods such as exponential growthestimated an R0 ranging from 2.2 to 3.58, with an average of2.67.3, 7, 11Our review found the average R0 to be 3.28 and median tobe 2.79, which exceed WHO estimates from 1.4 to 2.5. Thestudies using stochastic and statistical methods for deriving R0provide estimates that are reasonably comparable. However, thestudies using mathematical methods produce estimates that are,on average, higher. Some of the mathematically derived estimatesfall within the range produced the statistical and stochasticestimates. It is important to further assess the reason for thehigher R0 values estimated by some the mathematical studies.For example, modelling assumptions may have played a role. Inmore recent studies, R0 seems to have stabilized at around 2\u20133.R0 estimations produced at later stages can be expected to bemore reliable, as they build upon more case data and include theeffect of awareness and intervention. It is worthy to note thatthe WHO point estimates are consistently below all publishedestimates, although the higher end of the WHO range includesthe lower end of the estimates reviewed here.R0 estimates for SARS have been reported to range between2 and 5, which is within the range of the mean R0 forCOVID19 found in this review. Due to similarities of both pathogenand region of exposure, this is expected.

Theseestimates of R0 depend on the estimation method used as wellas the validity of the underlying assumptions. Due to insufficientdata and short onset time, current estimates of R0 forCOVID19 are possibly biased. However, as more data are accumulated,estimation error can be expected to decrease and a clearer pictureshould form. Based on these considerations, R0 for COVID-19 isexpected to be around 2\u20133, which is broadly consistent with theWHO estimate.J.R. and A.W.S. had the idea, and Y.L. did the literature searchand created the table and figure.
