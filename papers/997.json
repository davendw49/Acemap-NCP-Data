Of the 41 patients, 27 had direct exposure to theWuhan seafood market, which is thought to be the initialinfection site from an animal source [                ehT ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak has undoubtedly broughtback memories of the severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS)\u2013coronavirus (CoV) outbreak, which started 17\u00a0 yearsago [                However, according to the updated version (version 4)\u00a0 of anew coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control programpublished by China\u2019s National Health Commission [        Herein, we report the epidemiological features of a familycluster involving 4 2019-nCoV cases in Shanghai. Two casepatients were from Wuhan, but the other 2 had not left Shanghairecently. eTh evidence from our epidemiological investigationsuggests that 2019-nCoV may be infectious during theincubation period.        On 21 January 2020, 2 patients from the same family unit weretaken to hospital A\u00a0 in Shanghai with fever, respiratorysymptoms, and pulmonary infiltrates on their chest radiographs.Considering the serious outbreak in Wuhan, both cases werediagnosed as suspected 2019-nCov infection, according tothe epidemiological history and clinical features. The patientswere immediately isolated and reported to the local Center forDisease Control and Prevention.ehT investigators from the local center immediately conducteda face-to-face epidemiological survey for patients 1 and 2, andthey collected clinical and laboratory data, including results ofhematological, radiological, and respiratory pathogenexaminations. On 23 January 2020, another 2 patients from this familyunit were also taken to hospital A with fever.\u00a0Cases 3 and 4 wereinvestigated by telephone. Epidemiological information had beenprovided by the patients.

The relationships and demographic informationare shown in Figure\u00a01.Patient 1, an 88-year-old man, was incapacitated, and had hyp-ertension, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease. He lived in Shanghai year-round, with only his wife, patient4.\u00a0He had not left home for at least 2 weeks before illness onset,and had no contact with any other people except patients 2, 3,and 4. He had had no contact with wild animals or persons withfever or pneumonia, nor had visited a farmers market or localhospitals in Shanghai 2 weeks before illness onset.At about 11 am on 20 January, patient 1 had a poor appetiteand dry cough at home, and then a fever (body temperature,38.2\u00b0C). He was taken to hospital A\u00a0by ambulance at 5 pm on21 January (Figure\u00a02). Because of his serious illness, he wasadmitted to the intensive care unit with supportive treatment,including oxygen and uflids.Preadmission examination showed a body temperature of38.2\u00b0C and normal blood test results, with a white blood cellcount of 7.16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L and an absolute lymphocyte count valueof 1.19\u00a0 \u00d7\u00a0 109/L; the C-reactive protein level was also normal.Computed tomography showed interstitial hyperplasia withinfection in both of the patient\u2019s lungs, especially the posteriorsegment of the upper lobe of the right lung and the posteriorbasal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung, chronicbronchitis, emphysema, pulmonary bullae of lingual segment ofthe left lung, pulmonary hypertension in both lungs, increasedheart shadow, and calcification of the aorta and aortic wall.Both inuflenza A\u00a0and B antigen tests had negative results.Patients 2 and 3, married and living in Wuhan, visited patients1 and 4 in Shanghai by high-speed train on 15 January. (Patient2 was patient 4\u2019s sister.) From 1 to 19 January, about 2 weeksbefore illness onset, patients 2 and 3 lived as they normally did.They did not eat out, come into contact with wild animals, orvisit a farmers market, such as the Huanan seafood wholesalemarket. They were not exposed to patients with fever orpneumonia and did not visit local hospitals in Wuhan.

Here are ourrecommendations. First, the epidemiological exposure history shouldbe taken as the most important reference for judging thepotential source of infection, and isolation and protection measuresshould be further strengthened for the relevant persons withclear risk factors for exposure history. Second, thedetermination of close contacts should also include those who are exposedto case patients during their incubation. Third, research intoand development of a high-sensitivity rapid diagnostic reagentfor 2019-nCoV should be accelerated, to facilitate the screeningof infected persons among clinical and close contacts. Fourth,health education should be further strengthened, and protectiveequipment should be properly used to reduce the exposure to2019-nCoV. Finally, if possible, the isolation and medical obse-rvation of close contacts should be centralized under the premiseof the safely transport, such as masks, single-person transferand transport vehicle disinfection,\u00a0et al. It is important toestablish a community supervision mechanism when home isolationand observation are needed.Acknowledgments. eTh authors thank Dr Lihong Huang forher valuable advice and assistance during the draft and revisionof this manuscript; the Shanghai Center for Disease Control andPrevention for the 2019 novel coronavirus nucleic acid tests; andJinma Ren and AME Editing Service for editing the manuscript.We appreciate all individuals and healthcare departments whohave provided help and contributions to this study.4 \u2022 jidFinancial support.
