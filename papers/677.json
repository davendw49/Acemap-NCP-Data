Here wereport that a novel SARS-CoV-2 mutation appears to be spreading worldwide, whichdeserves close attention.We detected 95 SARS-CoV-2 samples from Sichuan Province of China using nextgeneration sequencing and acquired 13 whole genomes sequences, which wereanalyzed for sequence variation and evolution against 199 SARS-CoV-2 genomespublicly released in the GISAID EpiFluTM database (https://www.gisaid.org/) and 7genomes download from NGDC database (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). This study wasapproved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of SichuanUniversity (reference no. 193, 2020) and written informed consent was obtained from allpatients.Based on 10 high frequency mutations (mutant allele frequency >5%), theseSARS-CoV-2 genomes can be classified into 5 main groups: original stain 1 and 4variants with different mutations groups and clustering. The most common variants(Figure A, Group 1) exhibited both a missense mutation (ORF8:c.251tTa>tCa; presentin 31.58% of the isolates) and a synonymous mutation (orf1ab:c.8517agC>agT; foundin 30.62% of the isolates), suggesting a possible linkage between these two sites. Also,3 subgroups were evolved in the main Group 1 by other 3 mutations. Group 2 wasclustered together with 3 mutants including missense variant S: c.1841gAt>gGt,orf1ab upstream gene variant and synonymous_variant orf1ab: c.2772ttC>ttT. Group3 viral isolates were much less frequent (11.48%) and characterized by a missensemutation (orf1ab:c.10818ttG>ttT). Group 4 viral isolates contained a novel missensemutation (ORF3a:c.752gGt>gTt) first found in a Chinese family. Notably, however,Group 4 viral isolates were most frequently found outside mainland China (23.28%;27/116; p<0.01 by Fisher\u2019s exact test). Additionally, Group 2 and Group 4 showedobvious aggregation in non-Chinese countries and regions.The family in which the Group 4 variant was first observed in China (an older female6566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293and two young family members) returned to their hometown in Sichuan from Wuhanon January 20, 2020. By January 23, the mother had a fever and cough, and her twochildren developed these symptoms in the following days. Nucleic acid assaysperformed on their throat swabs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on January 25. Noneof these individuals traveled outside of China between the start of the COVID-19epidemic and their return to Sichuan, but there the Group 4 variant first observed inthis family has now demonstrated global dissemination.We performed a timeline analysis using the sample collection dates reported in theGISAID EpiFluTM database, and found that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2strain containing the Group 4 ORF3a mutant had reached the West Coast of theUnited States (Orange County, California) by January 22, 2020 at the latest.Immediately afterwards, and preceding or at nearly the same time as first Group 4cases in Sichuan, additional isolates (Figure B) of this strain were reported in China(Taiwan), France (Paris), and Australia (Sydney and Clayton). According to theofficial records, these individuals either traveled frominternationally prior to their disease onset. Group 4 ORF3a mutants weresubsequently found in several other countries, including Singapore, South Korea, theUnited Kingdom and Italy. It should be noted that this mutant virus strain appears tobe the most prevalent form of SARS-COV-2 in France, Italy,Brazil, and Singapore(Figure C).Virus genome data from France indicate that SARS-CoV-2 strains carryingORF3a:c.752gGt>gTt often have a S:c.1099Gtc>Ttc mutation in their S gene, whichinteracts with ACE2 to mediate viral entry into its host cells3, and is regarded as acritical factor for viral transmission and virulence4, 5. It is not clear if this mutationenhances host cell entry but this information would be of great importance inassessing the potential for increased virulence of Group 4 SARS-CoV-2 strainscarrying this mutation. It is also not known how common this mutation is in Group 4viral isolates from different geographical regions. Given the prevalence of Group 4isolates in multiple countries, including France, Italy and South Korea, which isexperiencing a rapidly growing epidemic, this information should be of significant9596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121interest.At present, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in China seems to be diminishing in responseto control efforts, but the rapid global spread of this new virus, and its mutants, hasbecome a major health concern. Very little is known about how rapidly theSARS-CoV-2 genome mutates and how this affects transmission or disease severity.Better understanding of these factors should be useful in efforts to curtail the globaland regional spread of this virus.Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.Funding/Support: This study was funded by Science & Technology Department of SichuanProvince (Grant number: 2020YFS0004) and West China Hospital of Sichuan University(Grant number: HX-2019-nCoV-066).Additional Contributions: We thank Dr Wan Xiong for polishing the manuscript language.We also thank Shuo Guo and Yanbing Zhou for collecting literature.Reference\uff1awww.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/Shu Y, McCauley J.
