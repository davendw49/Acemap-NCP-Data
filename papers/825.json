We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing eofrts) be unsuccessful. Findings For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1\u00b75, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000-320 000), corresponding to 7\u22194% (IQR 6\u00b75-8\u00b75) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000-776 000) when R0 was 2\u00b70, corresponding to 19\u22193% (17\u22198-20\u22196) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000-1 249 000) when R0 was 2\u00b75, corresponding to 32% (30\u22199-33\u22191) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most efective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\u22193% (IQR 92\u22196-99\u22199) when R0 was 1\u00b75, by 93\u00b70% (81\u22195-99\u22197) when R0 was 2\u00b70, and by 78\u22192% (59\u00b70 -94\u22194) when R0 was 2\u00b75. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50\u00b70%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1\u00b75. Interpretation Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention efectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for efective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.", "text": "In December, 2019, several health facilities in theChinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) reportedclusters of individuals with pneumonia1 whose clinicalpresentations resembled the symptoms of severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), whichemerged in 2002 in the nearby Guangdong province andled to outbreaks worldwide.2 On Jan 7, 2020, a novelstrain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was isolated, confirmingthe circulation of a new respiratory illness, coronavirusdisease 2019 (COVID-19), with evidence suggesting thatthe Huanan seafood wholesale market was the initialtransmission site.3 On Jan 1, 2020, the market was closedfor environmental sanitation and disinfection to preventfurther transmission.4 Cases of COVID-19 have sincebeen reported in health-care workers3 and family clustersin China,5 with 67 794 cases and 3805 deaths confirmedAt present, in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China,an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isongoing, caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previouslycalled 2019-nCoV). Evidence to date has suggested rapid spreadof the virus: at the time of writing, imported cases have beenreported in 143 countries and territories, including Singapore.243 confirmed cases have been reported in Singapore; however,this number is expected to increase substantially in thefollowing weeks. In 2003, SARS-CoV, which also originatedfrom mainland China, established locally, causing 33 deathsafter 238 cases were confirmed. Therefore, there is considerableconcern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of COVID-19 havealready been confirmed in mainland China, which surpasses thenumbers observed in the SARS-CoV outbreak. 2020 LunarNew Year celebrations have now ended, marking a periodof extensive travel between China and Singapore, and acorresponding high risk for case importation. Despiteheightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspectedto have COVID-19 and confirmed cases, the risk is ongoing,with the number of cases continuing to increase in Singapore.Immediate deployment of interventions will be required tocontain the outbreak in the event that significant secondarylocal transmission is observed within the community. Wesearched PubMed from database inception to Feb 26, 2020,for articles using the search terms \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d,\u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, and \u201ccoronavirusinterventions\u201d. Our search yielded three relevant articles.in Hubei province as of March 15, 2020.6 Olderindividuals (aged >60 years) and people with chronicunderlying health conditions are particularly susceptibleto severe disease.5 Rapid spread of the virus compelledthe Chinese Government to restrict movement inafected cities, with the cessation of public transport 7 andcancellation of flights. 8 Despite extensive eforts toprevent onward spread, 143 countries and territoriesoutside of mainland China have now reported importedcases.6Internationally, ongoing local transmission ofSARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in 81 countries andterritories.6 In Singapore, 243 individuals have testedpositive for SARS-CoV-2, 121 have been hospitalised andare stable, 13 are in a critical condition, and 109 havebeen discharged at the time of writing.9 The first case inSingapore was identified on Jan 23, 2020, and wasimported from China;10 a further 68 cases were imported,with the remaining 175 cases most likely the resultof transmission within Singapore.11 All imported caseswere travellers who had returned from Wuhan beforeFeb 4, 2020, with transmission to close contacts recordedwithin families at a church and shop in three smalltransmission clusters.11Two articles investigated the efects of travel restrictions inWuhan during the early stages of the outbreak; one of thearticles additionally investigated the efects of quarantine inChina, and the other article estimated the efectiveness ofairport screening for the detection of infected travellers.We found no articles assessing the eficacy of immediatenational control measures outside of China.This study is the first to investigate the use of isolation forindividuals with COVID-19 and quarantine of family members,school closures, and workplace distancing as interventions forthe immediate control of COVID-19 in the event of secondarylocal transmission using a simulation model. We found that acombined approach (incorporating quarantine, school closures,and workplace distancing) could prevent a national outbreak atlow levels of infectivity and reduce the number of totalinfections considerably at higher levels of infectivity. Suchcontrol measures should be deployed in countries outside ofChina with evidence of imported cases and evidence of localtransmission.The results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore andother countries with evidence to begin the implementation ofrelatively standard outbreak control measures that couldmitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployedefectively and in a timely manner.As of March 16, 2020, inpatients with COVID-19 inSingapore are isolated at the hospital they present to or atthe National Centre for Infectious Diseases, a specialisedfacility designed to facilitate infectious disease outbreakresponse.10 A government-wide taskforce has beenestablished to increase surveillance at borders andprepare the public in terms of awareness and education.10The Ministry of Health Singapore has implementedcontact tracing eofrts to identify potential cases amongpeople travelling with, or in close proximity to, individualswith COVID-19.12 Despite these eofrts and nationwideprecautionary measures, including the dispensing ofmasks to households and public hospital emergencydepartments being on high alert for an outbreak response,the number of suspected and imported cases in Singaporeis expected to increase due to the high volume ofincoming travellers.10 Preliminary estimates indicate thatthe ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5\u22191% (95% CI4\u22198\u20135\u22195);13 however, high levels of under-reporting andmisdiagnosis due to dicfiulties in identifying cases makeit challenging for policy makers to prepare a large-scaleresponse. Consequently, following the recommendationsmade by Wu and colleagues,14 modelling studies areneeded to estimate the potential impact of interventionsin the early phase of the outbreak when uncertainty ishighest, which is crucial should local transmission beginto increase.In this study, we aimed to develop a national spatialmodel of COVID-19 transmission in Singapore toestimate the distribution of cases across time and spaceand to assess the potential impact of interventions onoutbreak size should local containment eforts fail.We used FluTE,15 an agent-based inuflenza epidemicsimulation model, which accounts for demography, hostmovement, and social contact rates in workplaces, schools,and homes to estimate the likelihood of human-to-humantransmission of SARS-CoV-2 should local containmentfail. The FluTE simulation model requires a syntheticpopulation to build the contact and transmission network.Therefore, we used the geographical, demographic, andepidemiological model of Singapore (hereafter referredto as GeoDEMOS-R, where R represents respiratoryillness),16 a modelling framework that aims to recreate asynthetic but realistic representation of the Singaporeanpopulation at the household and individual level. Wegenerated the synthetic population using national 2010census data17,18 to tfi multiple attributes of the population atthe household and individual level. The generatedhouseholds contained demographic characteristics, such as age,marital status, religion, and ethnicity, of householdmembers. Individuals were then allocated to workplacesor educational facilities on the basis of local transportationdata and home addresses according to 2010 censusdata.19 The contact behaviour of individuals in the areaof their home (ie, between family members and their localcommunity; denfied as the home community), workplace,and school, where applicable, were recorded with potentialtransmission events as a function of infectivity. We ran themodels for 80 days to investigate the early stages of anepidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly amongthe resident population at 0 days, representing a fewgenerations of local transmission at the time of scenarioimplementation (ie, when contact tracing has failed toidentify cases within the community and unknown localtransmission has started). A full description of the modelis available in the appendix (pp 1\u20135).Within the FluTE infection model, we assumed that noindividual had existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Sincedata (ie, infectiousness, the cumulative distributionfunction for the incubation period, and the durationof hospital stay) on SARS-CoV-2 were unavailable atthe time of designing this study, we used SARS-CoVparameters to estimate the infectivity profile ofSARS-CoV-2. These parameters included how infectiousan individual is over time,20 the proportion of thepopulation assumed to be asymptomatic (7\u00b75%),21 thecumulative distribution function for the mean incubationperiod (with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 having thesame mean incubation period of 5\u00b73 days),3,22 and theduration of hospital stay after symptom onset (3\u00b75 days).20Asymptomatic individuals were able to infect at a50% reduced rate compared with their symptomaticcounterparts based on estimates from Nishiura andcolleagues.23We also investigated four alternate asymptomaticproportions: 22\u00b77%, as reported by Furuya-Kanamoriand colleagues24 for influenza A H1N1 in a pooledprevalence study; and 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%, aspotential but theoretical proportions to investigateintervention eficacy with a high fraction of infectionsthat are cryptic and undetectable.Three values for the basic reproduction number (R0)were chosen for the infectiousness factor (1\u22195, 2\u00b70, and2\u22195) on the basis of analyses of Wuhan case data by Wuand colleagues.14For the baseline scenario (ie, no interventions), we ran1000 epidemic simulations to account for the stochasticityin infection contact networks and to calculate CIsacross time. Four intervention scenarios were proposedfor implementation after failure of local containment,following policy options currently being assessed by theSingaporean Ministry of Health, as standard interventionsfor respiratory virus control: isolation of infectedindividuals and quarantine of their family members(hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plusimmediate school closure for 2 weeks; quarantine plusimmediate workplace distancing, in which 50% of theworkforce is encouraged to work from home for 2 weeks;and a combination of quarantine, immediate schoolclosure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred toas the combined intervention). Quarantine of infectedindividuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onsetin a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 bedsat maximum capacity (during the early stage of theoutbreak) and is fully equipped to handle full quarantinemeasures (ie, negative pressure isolation rooms, fullpersonal protective equipment use by sta)f so that theindividual is unable to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to otherinpatients. At full capacity, the remaining individuals See Online for appendixare isolated at home after receiving treatment. Familymembers of infected individuals are quarantined at homefor 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school orinfect the wider community at their residential address.However, transmission within families is possible asa result of the presence of an isolated and infectedindividual. Each of these intervention scenarios had1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded thelocation of infection as the home community, workplace,or school (appendix pp 3\u20134).Each of the 1000 epidemic simulations had a set ofparameters, and was run for baseline and the four1412)sdsan 10uoh(tsn 8oitifcen 6foreb 4muN2040)sdn 30asuoh(tsiton 20iffcenorebum10N050)s 40dnasuo(tsh 30noitceiffn 20orebmuN 10the same parameters, not the medians of each grouping.We calculated IQRs as the 25th and 75th simulation interms of cumulative case count at 80 days. We used Rstatistical software (version 3.6.3) to plot graphs and forall analyses. We chose to present intervention data forthe scenario in which R0 is 2\u00b70, because this represents amoderate and likely outbreak for policy planners. Therelatively mild (R0 =1\u00b75) and severe (R0 =2.5) outbreakscenarios are presented in the appendix (pp 9\u201310).The funders had no role in study design, datacollection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writingof the report. The corresponding author had full accessto all the data in the study and had final responsibilityfor the decision to submit for publication.        For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1\u00b75, the mediancumulative number of infections on day 80 was 279 000(IQR 245 000\u2013320 000; gfiure 1, table), which correspondsto 7\u22194% (IQR 6\u22195\u20138\u22195) of the population. For thequarantine intervention, the median cumulative numberof infections at day 80 was reduced to 15 000 (800\u201330 000;table; appendix p 9), which is a 94\u22198% decrease(90\u00b72\u201399\u00b77) in the number of infected individualscompared with the baseline scenario. School closure andworkplace distancing reduced the median cumulativenumber of infections on day 80 to 10 000 (                When R0 was 2\u00b70, the proportion of the Singaporeanpopulation infected under the baseline scenario increased to19\u22193% (IQR 17\u22198\u201320\u22196), with a median cumulative numberof infections on day 80 of 727000 (IQR 670000\u2013776000;gifure 1, table). On day 80, quarantine resulted in a cumulative median of 130000 cases (38000\u2013244000), schoolclosure 97000 cases (14000\u2013219000), workplace distancing67000 cases (11000\u2013145000), and the combined intervention50000 cases (2000\u2013143000; gfiure 2, table). The maximumnumber of daily infections was 27800 (IQR 27300\u201328000)for the baseline scenario, 11000 (4100\u201318600) for thequarantine scenario, 8400 (        For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 2\u00b75, 32%(IQR 30\u22199\u201333\u22191) of the Singaporean population wereinfected, with a cumulative median of 1 207 000 cases(IQR 1 164 000\u20131 249 000) on day 80 (figure 1, table). A tthis level of transmission, quarantine resulted in amedian of 520 000 cases (268 000\u2013754 000), schoolclosure 466 000 cases (175 000\u2013728 000), workplacedistancing 320 000 cases (116 000\u2013558 000), and thecombined intervention 258 000 cases (65 000\u2013508 000;table; appendix p 10). The maximum number of dailyinfections was 42 800 (IQR 41 400\u201343 500) for thebaseline scenario, 37 900 (25 900\u201341 800) for thequarantine scenario, 36 400 (18 100\u201341 400) for theschoolclosure scenario, 29 800 (12 500\u201340 500) for theworkplace-distancing scenario, and 25 200 (7700\u201339 200)for the combined intervention (figure 1; appendixp 10). Compared with baseline, the combined approachresulted in the greatest reduction in cases (78\u00b72%[IQR 59\u00b70\u201394\u00b74]).For all simulations, the median age of infection was37 years (IQR 26\u201349). The location of infection (school,workplace, or home community) was determinedaccording to the site where individuals were exposed tothe virus (table). Owing to behaviours of schoolabsenteeism and work-distancing presenteeism, thenumber of infections acquired at work consistentlyexceeded those at school, although students could betransmitting the virus within the home community(table). Such patterns of transmission are particularlyevident for the combined intervention at higher levels ofinfectivity (R0=2\u00b75), with a median of 1300 infectionsacquired at school (IQR 300\u20132800), 124 000 at theworkplace (31 000\u2013241 000), and 132 000 (34 000\u2013265 000)in the home community.The median number of daily infections across timeshowed that when R0 was 1\u00b75 or 2\u00b70, the epidemic peakwas unlikely to occur during the 80-day timeframe,whereas when R0 was 2\u00b75, a peak in cases was observedapproximately 9 weeks after reaching 100 communityinfections (gfiure 1). When R 0 was 2\u00b75, the interventionshad a suppressive eefct on the number of new cases eachday, although the number of cases continued to increaseat day 80, indicating a delayed intervention eefct ratherthan a preventive eefct as observed when R 0 was 1\u00b75(gfiure 2; appendix pp 9\u201310). Geospatially, the number ofcases across Singapore at day 80 show a high number ofhome community infections in highly residential areasand considerable infection-source mixing (gfiure 3;appendix p 11). The combined intervention had thegreatest eefct on the number of infections, with auniversal reduction across Singapore when R0 was1\u00b75 (gfiure 3). The combined intervention had a smallereefct when R0 was 2\u00b70 or 2\u00b75, with a relativelyhomogeneous distribution nationwide, although denseresidential clusters in the north of Singapore, in areasnear the Malaysia border, indicate strong comparativepersistence of the virus despite the use of the combinedapproach (gfiure 3).Our models assumed that 7\u00b75% of cases wereasymptomatic. Considering a higher asymptomatic proportionof the total infected population of 22\u00b77%, owing toisolation of fewer infected individuals and quarantine offewer family members, for the quarantine scenario whenR0 was 1\u00b75, an additional 100 000 cases (IQR 41 800\u2013152 000)would be observed at 80 days (appendix p 7). Similarly, ahigher asymptomatic proportion resulted in a highermedian cumulative number of cases for theschoolclosure, work-distancing, and combined interventionwas 2\u00b70, assuming an asymptomatic proportion of 22\u00b77%,an additional 381 000 cases (IQR 250 000\u2013474 000) wereobserved for the quarantine scenario, 400 000 cases(275 000\u2013509 000) for the school-closure scenario,316 000 cases (175 000\u2013433 000) for theworkplacedistancing scenario, and 294 000 cases (162 000\u2013430 000)for the combined interventions scenario (appendix p 13).When R0 was 2\u00b75, an additional 577 000 cases(IQR 382 000\u2013777 000), 557 000 cases (372 000\u2013785000),567 000 cases (379 000\u2013775 000), and 599 000 cases(394 000\u2013804 000) were observed for the quarantine,school-closure, workplace-distancing, and combinedintervention scenarios, respectively (appendix p 14). Themedians of the number of infections and location ofinfection for the 22\u00b77% asymptomatic fraction ispresented in the appendix (p 7).The median number of infections and location ofinfection for the higher theoretical asymptomatic proportionsare presented in the appendix (p 8). At higherasymptomatic proportions of 30\u00b70%, 40\u00b70%, and 50\u00b70%, furtherincreases were observed (appendix pp 8, 15\u201319). We onlyran the analysis at higher asymptomatic rates at the lowerlevel of infectivity (R0=1\u00b75), because we observedsubstantial increases in the number of cases observed,reeflcting poor case control that would otherwise beexacerbated and lead to containment failure at higherinfectivity. When R0 was 1\u00b75, interventions causedsubstantial reductions in the number of infections atasymptomatic fractions of 7\u00b75% and 22\u00b77%. Forquarantine, by comparison with the number of casesobserved for the 7\u00b75% asymptomatic proportionassumption when R0 was 1\u00b75, the median number ofcases increased by 172 000 (IQR 113 000\u2013221 000) for a30\u00b70% asymptomatic proportion. This number increasedto 253 000 (209 000\u2013294 000) for a 40\u00b70% asymptomaticfraction, and to 314 000 (276 000\u2013343 000) for a 50\u00b70%asymptomatic fraction (appendix pp 15\u201317). At anasymptomatic proportion of 30\u00b70%, increases comparedwith a 7\u00b75% asymptomatic proportion of 172 000(IQR 104 000\u2013221 000), 124 000 (53 100\u2013170 000), and114 000 cases (36 300\u2013172 000) were observed for schoolclosure, workplace distancing, and the combinedinterventions, respectively (appendix pp 15\u201317). Increasesfor school closure, workplace distancing, and combinedinterventions were 253 000 (IQR 206 000\u2013287 000), 203 000(153 000\u2013251 000), and 196 000 cases (134 000\u2013244 000),respectively, for an asymptomatic proportion of 40\u00b70%and 312 000 (278 000\u2013340 000), 269 000 (215 000\u2013308 000),and 267 000 cases (216 000\u2013307 000), respectively, foran asymptomatic proportion of 50\u00b70% (appendixpp 16\u201317).        Concerns about COVID-19 becoming a global epidemicare increasing on the basis of previous epidemics, such asSARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndromecoronavirus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza. The introduction of cases into new countries, regions and cities islikely to continue in areas where local establishmentcould form, depending on the ongoing level of controlmeasures. In the event that local containment isunsuccessful, our findings suggest that national outbreakcontrol is feasible provided that R0 is low (\u22641\u22195), with acombination of the proposed intervention measures(quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing)being most efective. Under this scenario (R 0=1\u00b75),workplace distancing reduced the median numberof cases from 279 000 (IQR 245 000\u2013 320 000) to 4000(        At the start of the outbreak, the risk of repeatedimportation of SARS-CoV-2 into Singapore was deemedto be considerable given that around 3\u22194 million peopletravel from Wuhan to Singapore annually.27 Furthermore,the start of the epidemic coincided with the 2020 ChineseLunar New Year holiday, with the expectation that thenumber of individuals arriving from China would besimilar to that for the 2018 celebrations (around800 000 tourists from China).27 The high influx ofincoming travellers exacerbated the risk of local diseaseestablishment, bringing at least 18 initial confirmedimported cases into Singapore before Feb 4, 2020, whenthe first four local transmission cases were confirmed. 11These four cases had contact with at least two infectedtourists at a shop, who were identified through intensivecontact tracing eforts. Although travel is now reduced, atleast 175 subsequent locally-acquired infections havebeen reported at the time of writing across a diverserange of residential and commercial sites despite efortsby the Singaporean Government to quarantine andisolate infected individuals. On March 16, 2020, 11 of the17 confirmed cases were imported with travel historiesincluding the UK, Indonesia, Portugal, Spain, the USA,France, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium.11 OnMarch 17, 2020, a further 17 of 23 cases were reported tobe imported.11 With the risk of disease establishmentremaining high from the continued importation of cases,workplace distancing and school closure remain ascritical interventions that can avert a significant numberof cases.        We found that these two interventions, when used incombination with quarantine, would be highly eefctive atlow infection rates (ie, R0 of 1\u00b75), with median of10 000 cases (IQR 200\u201328 000) observed for schoolclosures and 4000 cases (        Scale-up of ongoing surveillance programmes andrigorous contract tracing12,28 are thus required to assist inthe maintenance of a low number of unidentiefidinfections at this time, with school closure and workplacedistancing being potentially eefctive strategies fordeployment nationwide should local transmission, withmultiple transmission events recorded between individualsin the resident population, begin. Our simulation model,which examined hypothetical infection spread with100 unidentiefid Singaporean cases as a seed population,showed that for the baseline scenario (ie, no controlinterventions) by day 80, when R0 was 1\u00b75, around279 000 individuals would be infected, when R0 was 2\u00b70,around 727 000 individuals would be infected, and when R0was 2\u00b75, around 1 207 000 individuals would be infected.In the event that suppression of transmission throughquarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins,which has currently been observed in other countries on asmall scale,29,30 policy makers in Singapore should deployalternate measures, such as school closure and workplacedistancing, in a timely manner. School closure has beenused in the past in Singapore to limit the spread ofhand, foot, and mouth disease, and was associated with adecrease of up to 53% in secondary cases,31 probablybecause children generally have high contact rates withtheir peers in the school environment. Given this historicalexperience, a similar programme for COVID-19 could beestablished reasonably quickly. However, at present, dataon the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection,the number of infected children in Singapore, and theprobability of children becoming symptomatic are limited,making school closure less desirable than workplacedistancing.The continually high percentage contribution ofworkrelated infections despite work distancing being efectivesuggests that the workplace is a key infection site inSingapore, whereby reductions in workplacetransmission averts cases at all other sites. The efects ofschool closure and quarantine were comparable, sincethe displacement of students to the home communitywill then rely on quarantine as a measure of preventinginfection. However, asymptomatic cases, assumed toaccount for 7\u22195% of the infected population, wouldcontinue to contribute to transmission, and the identificationof these individuals presents a challenge.        Increasing the asymptomatic proportion in our modelfrom 7\u00b75% to 22\u00b77%, which is reeflctive of inuflenza AH1N1,24 resulted in limited infection control withconsiderable stochasticity, whereby the failure of earlyquarantine led to outbreaks similar in size to those observedfor the baseline scenario, even when R0 was 1\u00b75. Under thisassumption, the median number of cases averted comparedwith baseline ranged from 219 000 to 282 000 cases(64\u00b74\u201382\u00b79% reduction) depending on the interventionscenario. For the quarantine, school-closure,work-distancing, and combined intervention scenarios, assumingan asymptomatic proportion of 7\u00b75% and an R0 of 1\u00b75, amedian of 264 000\u2013277 200 cases (94\u00b76\u201399\u00b74% reduction)would be averted compared with the baseline scenario.Thus, considering the diefrences in number of casesaverted by proportion of asymptomatic individuals in thepopulation, additional interventions, such as vaccination(where research is rapidly ongoing) or the prescribing ofexisting antiviral drugs that are eefctive for the treatmentof related viral infections, should be considered. Contactinhibition remains important, but the high proportion ofasymptomatic and undocumented infections and missedopportunities to quarantine will make control challenging.Even at a low infectivity (R0 \u22641\u00b75), a high asymptomaticproportion is problematic, with with 411 000 infections(IQR 223 000\u2013540 000) occurring at an asymptomaticproportion of 22\u00b77% compared with 1800 infections(        Regardless of the proportion of individuals in thepopulation with asymptomatic infection, all the proposedinterventions should be used in addition to othermeasures, such as rapid diagnosis and appropriate casemanagement, if local containment fails. Currentgovernment-led outbreak control measures will only besuccessful with public cooperation through exercisinggood hygiene, infection prevention in shared spaces, andadequate education to understand when symptomsmight be indicative of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection.Public complicity is particularly crucial for olderindividuals (>60 years), individuals who areimmunocompromised, and people with comorbidities who are athigh risk of severe complications.5 During the 2003SARS outbreak, 238 probable SARS cases were reportedand 33 individuals died in Singapore, with the highestproportion of deaths (45%) reported among people aged65 years and older.32 The same observation is thusexpected for COVID-19 should local transmission occursince the median age of infection in our models was37 years (IQR 26\u201349), with comparatively few childrenbecoming infected because of school closure andawareness among parents to quarantine children with fever.Singapore has one of the highest employment ratesamong older individuals (aged \u226565 years) of all countrieswithin the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD)33 and a culture of eating atsocalled hawker centres (ie, food courts), with around75% of people visiting a hawker centre at least once aweek.34 Consequently, many older people are expected tobe exposed to infection at work or within their homecommunities, which could be mitigated in part byimplementation of workplace distancing and, if possible,incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplacedistancing, specifically for older individuals.At present, the quarantining of family and close contactsof conrfimed cases is crucial, as shown by the substantialincrease in infection rates among individuals who sharedliving spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 H1N1inuflenza pandemic in China, despite the regulardisinfection of these areas.35 The protocols in place atpresent, including the use of specialist ambulances,negative pressure isolation rooms, and ultravioletdisinfection, will assist in isolating the infection andpreventing transmission events at health-care facilities, aswas seen during the 2003 SARS outbreak.21 Since at least15 medical staf in Wuhan have contracted the virus, 3Singapore has provided full personal protective equipmentfor health-care workers; however, the results of our studysuggest that community transmission will substantiallycontribute to transmission should local containment faildespite these measures. The main control measures atthis time are surveillance, standard testing procedures,36and quarantine of individuals who are conrfimed positivefor the virus. Such measures have been used in the pastfor suspected cases of MERS-CoV, which has a 34\u22194%casefatality rate,37 with no cases of MERS-CoV reported inSingapore to date, and for Zika virus, which establishedlocally in 2016, with only ten cases reported in 2019.38 Suchsuccesses in preventing local outbreaks are attributed torobust disease surveillance in Singapore. Nevertheless,dengue outbreaks are ongoing in Singapore,39 whichhighlights the dicfiulties in disease control that are in partdue to undocumented spread and individuals who areasymptomatic; these issues are likely to aefct the controlof the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic since many importedcases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry tocountries.9 The implementation of school closure andworkplace distancing can therefore be considered as apotential secondary control response in the event ofinfection quarantine failure and the establishment ofcommunity transmission.Our study has several limitations. First, sinceGeoDEMOS-R is validated against census data, errorsexist in our estimations of population features that arebased on data that have been sample enumerated.Second, a large population of migrant workers whotravel from Malaysia to Singapore each day, visitingtourists, and long-term visa owners were not accountedfor in our infection dynamics. Third, the epidemiologicalcharacteristics of COVID-19 remain uncertain in termsof the transmission and infectivity profile of the virus;therefore, estimates of the time between symptom onsetand admission to hospital, how infectious an individualis over time, and the asymptomatic rate were based onSARS-CoV. Once this information becomes available forCOVID-19, a full sensitivity analysis should be done.Fourth, the contact patterns between individuals arehighly dynamic and heterogeneous across thepopulation; therefore, our simulated work, school, and homepopulations serve as a general estimation of infectionspread. Fifth, efectiveness of the interventions mightvary depending on the ongoing seeding of importedcases, which we did not account for, and will also rely onintervention compliance. Sixth, multiple indirect efectsfrom the interventions and modifications to humanbehaviour are likely, which are dificult to quantify andmeasure. The optimum times to implement eachintervention and how long they should be run for toachieve long-term epidemic control should be explored.Finally, there are multiple unforeseen factors thatremain challenging to assess at this time, such asincreased infection rates at mass gatherings, delays inquarantining as a result of individuals not seeking healthcare at symptom onset, alternate contact events inlocations such as public transport, potential transmissionevents in the health-care setting, and the efects ofcommunity-wide behavioural shifts in response toknowledge of the outbreak.Pandemic planning is crucial at the early stages to avert anationwide outbreak. In this study, we investigated the useof interventions that aim to restrict contact betweenindividuals at important mixing sites: schools, workplaces,and at home. We found that, especially for lower infectionscenarios (R0 of 1\u00b75), a combined approach comprisingquarantine (for infected individuals and their families),school closure, and workplace distancing is eefctive andcould prevent 99\u00b73% of infections (IQR 92\u22196\u201399\u22199) whencompared with the baseline scenario. At higher infectivityscenarios, outbreak prevention becomes considerablymore challenging because although eefctive, transmissionevents still occur: for the combined approach scenario, amedian of 50 000 cases were estimated at R0 of 2\u00b70 and258 000 cases at R0 of 2\u00b75. These combined interventionsshould therefore be implemented rapidly uponconrfimation of second-generation local transmissionoccurring within the resident population to suppressincreases in the national R0. At higher asymptomatic rates,public education and case management becomeincreasingly important, with a need to develop vaccinesand existing drug therapies.ContributorsJRK, BLD, and ARC designed the experiments.

The maximumnumber of daily infections was 27800 (IQR 27300\u201328000)for the baseline scenario, 11000 (4100\u201318600) for thequarantine scenario, 8400 (        For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 2\u00b75, 32%(IQR 30\u22199\u201333\u22191) of the Singaporean population wereinfected, with a cumulative median of 1 207 000 cases(IQR 1 164 000\u20131 249 000) on day 80 (figure 1, table). The location of infection (school,workplace, or home community) was determinedaccording to the site where individuals were exposed tothe virus (table). The combined intervention had a smallereefct when R0 was 2\u00b70 or 2\u00b75, with a relativelyhomogeneous distribution nationwide, although denseresidential clusters in the north of Singapore, in areasnear the Malaysia border, indicate strong comparativepersistence of the virus despite the use of the combinedapproach (gfiure 3).Our models assumed that 7\u00b75% of cases wereasymptomatic. When R0 was 1\u00b75, interventions causedsubstantial reductions in the number of infections atasymptomatic fractions of 7\u00b75% and 22\u00b77%. The introduction of cases into new countries, regions and cities islikely to continue in areas where local establishmentcould form, depending on the ongoing level of controlmeasures. On March 16, 2020, 11 of the17 confirmed cases were imported with travel historiesincluding the UK, Indonesia, Portugal, Spain, the USA,France, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium.11 OnMarch 17, 2020, a further 17 of 23 cases were reported tobe imported.11 With the risk of disease establishmentremaining high from the continued importation of cases,workplace distancing and school closure remain ascritical interventions that can avert a significant numberof cases. Our simulation model,which examined hypothetical infection spread with100 unidentiefid Singaporean cases as a seed population,showed that for the baseline scenario (ie, no controlinterventions) by day 80, when R0 was 1\u00b75, around279 000 individuals would be infected, when R0 was 2\u00b70,around 727 000 individuals would be infected, and when R0was 2\u00b75, around 1 207 000 individuals would be infected. In the event that suppression of transmission throughquarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins,which has currently been observed in other countries on asmall scale,29,30 policy makers in Singapore should deployalternate measures, such as school closure and workplacedistancing, in a timely manner. Given this historicalexperience, a similar programme for COVID-19 could beestablished reasonably quickly. The efects ofschool closure and quarantine were comparable, sincethe displacement of students to the home communitywill then rely on quarantine as a measure of preventinginfection. Increasing the asymptomatic proportion in our modelfrom 7\u00b75% to 22\u00b77%, which is reeflctive of inuflenza AH1N1,24 resulted in limited infection control withconsiderable stochasticity, whereby the failure of earlyquarantine led to outbreaks similar in size to those observedfor the baseline scenario, even when R0 was 1\u00b75.
