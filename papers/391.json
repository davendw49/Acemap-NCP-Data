A707172737475767778798081828384858687888990novel CoV instigating swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS) emerged sinceAugust 2016. It is associated with HKU2-related Rhinolophus bat CoV withdeath rate up to 90% in piglets 5 days or younger in Guangdong territory pigbreeding farms and accounted for the killing of around 25,000 piglets [                CoVs from various genera display evident serotypes, for the most part,because of the dissimilarity of their envelope-anchored diversified S proteins.S protein is of around 1300 amino acids, has a place with class I viralcombination protein, including SARS-CoVs, human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) envelop glycoprotein 160 (gp160), influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA),paramyxovirus F and Ebola virus glycoprotein [                The envelope trimeric S protein is vital for identifying host tropism andtransmission limit. It intercedes receptor binding to approach host cell cytosolutilizing acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of S protein by a cathepsin,TMPRRS2, or additional protease ensued by fusion of the membrane [        pathogenesis. Numerous \u03b1-CoVs, for example, human CoV (HCoV-229E),utilize aminopeptidase N (APN) as its receptor, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and          employangiotensin-convertingenzyme2 (ACE2), andMERS-CoV ties to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4). However, receptorinvestigation of SADS-CoV demonstrated that none of the known CoVreceptors, i.e., APN, ACE2, and DPP4, is crucial for cell entry that shows thedivergence and significance of S protein in SADS-CoV infection [          Notwithstanding the significance of the S protein in viral entry and hostimmunity, high-resolution structural details of this enormous macromolecularmachine have been hard to acquire. In this study, a cryo-EM structure ofSADS-CoV S glycoprotein at 3.55 \u00c5 resolution is determined. Correspondinglyin the present investigation of SADS-CoV, we portrayed the general structureof the S protein and the organization of its structural components. In light of the114115116117118119120121122123124125126127structures and functions of these essential components, we detail theevolutionary perspective of SADS-CoV S in comparison with S proteins fromdifferent CoV genera. In our study, SADS-CoV S forms a \u201clying down\u201dconformation following transition from inactive to active state and ACE2 is notthe receptor of SADS-CoV. The structural alignment suggests that SADS-CoVS is located between \u03b1-CoV and \u03b2-CoV clade. Hence, our results extend theunderstanding of critical structural and evolutionary insights into SADS-CoV Scomprising the CTD/RBD essential for receptor recognition and viral entry.This study provides the epidemiological and evolutionary information of thisnovel virus in China which is deteriorating economically important swineindustry, and highlights the urgency to develop effective measures to controlSADS-CoV.129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149        In order to investigate the role of SADS-CoV S in its invasion, we aimed tosolve the high-resolution structure of SADS-CoV S. SADS-CoV S ectodomainwas secretory expressed and purified from media of insert cells after 3 days ofinfection by baculovirus. A fusion peptide of General control protein GCN4 atthe C-terminal end of S was used to promote the protein forms a trimer [        The central helicase N(CH-N) and C (CH-C) of S2 from each subunit form a six-helix bundle in thecore of S trimer. Heptad repeats N (HR-N) contains four helices connected bythree loops locked between the S1 and S2 subunit at the outside of the S2stalk, while part of the HR-C is missed in the structure (Fig. 1G). Eachmonomeric subunit of S1 contains two major domains, S1-NTD and S1-CTDwhich are used to bind attachment sialic acid receptors or protein receptorsand play a key role in the coronavirus entry, and two subdomains, SD1 andSD2 whose function are not very clear (Fig. 1H-1I, Movie S1).Fig. 1.

Thiskind of conformation represents an inactive state (Fig. 2H). The CTDs in ourstructure keep a \u201clying down\u201d state and the receptor-binding moieties arepartially concealed. It needs to \u201cstand up\u201d on the spike trimer and release thesteric clash for efficient receptor binding. The linker between CTDs and S1subdomains workes as a hinge to facilitate the conformation change of CTDsfrom \u201clying down\u201d to \u201cstand up\u201d, furthermore, transit the receptor-bindinginactive state to active state (Fig. 2F).        It is noteworthy that stronger interactions in SADS-CoV spike trimer mayobstacle conformational change and dissociation of S1-CTD in prefusionprocess (Fig. S5). Moreover, to probe the intrinsic mobility of the CTD/RBD ofS trimer in the apo form (or to see whether the CTD/RBD of S trimer canspontaneously expand to an open state), we performed 2000 ns-longcoarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A Martini [                For the NTDs, the core structure consists of two six-stranded antiparallel\u03b2-sheet layers stacked together which takes the same galectin fold as humangalectins and the NTDs from the other genera. Besides the core structure,NTD of SADS-CoV S1 also has a loop (residues 133-150) formed as a partialceiling-like structure that resembles the partial ceiling of \u03b3-coronavirus ratherthan the other \u03b1- and \u03b4-coronavirus which do not have a ceiling-like structure,or the \u03b2-coronavirus which has a reinforced ceiling-like structure (Fig. 2I-M).Based on the structural similarity between the NTDs from four different CoVsgenera, the sugar-binding site in SADS-CoV S1-NTD might also be located inthe pocket formed between the core structure and the partial ceiling (Fig. 2I).Compared with other CoVs, the structure of the subdomain under the coredomain of SADS-CoV S1-NTD has the same situation of the partial ceiling-likestructure (Fig. 2I-M). Previous study gave the idea that NTDs from the fourgenera form an evolutionary spectrum in the order of \u03b1-, \u03b4-, \u03b3- and \u03b2-genera,with \u03b1-CoVs NTD probably being the most ancestral [                For the CTDs, despite there are dramatic sequential differences betweenSADS-CoV S1-CTD and other CTDs, all of them share the similar structuraltopology [        (N-R).

Notably, SADS-CoV uses the variant loop region as355 its RBM which is consist with the insertion domain of SARS-CoV andMERS-CoV, HKU1 and OC43 (Table S2). Taken together, these results areconsistent with that of the sequence alignment.Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we compared the CTDs ofSADS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by the sequence and structure. Thewhole SADS-CoV S ectodomain is only approximately 30% sequence identitywhen compared with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which obstructsstructural alignment between SADS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.Especially there is no significant homologous CoV S CTD found in the PDBwhen the SADS-CoV S CTD sequence as the inquiry. Interestingly, theSADS-CoV S CTD is smaller (about 130 residues) than other CoV CTD (about170 residues) (Fig. 3A). To further investigate the differences between the S ofSADS and other CoVs, and deduce the hypothesis of SADS pathogenicmechanisms, we focused on CTD and performed structural alignments using349 the complexes of CTD (SARS-CoV-2)-ACE2, CTD (SARS-CoV)-ACE2, CTD350 (NL63-CoV)-ACE2 (Fig. 3B-3D) and the CTDs of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV336337338339340341342343344345346347348351352356SARS-CoV-2 CTDs that is formed by two \u03b2 sheets and several loops (Fig. 3E).Meanwhile, compared with the \u03b2-CoVs SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the358359360361362363364365366367368369370\u03b1-CoV NL63 also use its loops to bind ACE2. Although the loops of SADS-CoVand NL63 CTDs share structural similarity, SADS-CoV cannot use the ACE2as its receptor. These features imply that both of the variant sequence and thelocal structure of these loops are combined to determine the receptor bindingspecificity.Fig. 3.

Red andpurple ribbons indicate ACE2 binding motif (insertion domain).As a protein located on the surface of the virus, the spike proteins mediateviral entry into host cells and also undergo the immune pressure from theimmune system of host at the same time. The structure of SADS-CoV Sprovides some hints on the immune evasion strategies of SADS-CoV.        On one hand, the SADS-CoV S has a classical compact structure as other\u03b1-CoVs, which uses the intra-subunit packing mode (Fig. 2A-2B). As a result,this kind of architecture can maximally reduce the surface area of the spikeprotein to the immune system. Moreover, all of the NTDs and CTDs in a \u201claydown\u201d station (closed conformation) can further reduce immune pressure (Fig.2F). Nevertheless, the NTDs and CTDs still have the chance to expose forreceptor binding. Furthermore, they can also be selected as single- ortwo-RBD system [                On the other hand, as one of the immune evasion strategy, masking ofepitopes by glycan shielding is usual in coronavirus evolution [        Fig. 4.

As a new coronavirus which was responsible for a\nlarge-scale outbreak of fatal disease in piglets in China, swine acute diarrhea\nsyndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) originated from the same genus of\nhorseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as SARS-CoV and possesses a broad species\ntropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse\nspecies. Given the importance of the spike glycoprotein (S) protein in viral\nentry and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the\nSADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 \u00c5. Our\nstudies reveal that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary\npacking mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together\nby facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other\nfour genera gives the suggestion of the evolutionary procedure of the\nSADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural\nfeatures, i.e., more compact architecture of S trimer, masking of epitopes by\nglycan shielding, which may facilitate to viral immune evasion. These data\nprovide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and\nwould deepen our understanding of their structural and functional diversity\nwhich will facilitate to vaccine development.\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68", "one_words_summarize": "2728293031323334353637383940414243444546The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has aroused greatpublic health concern.

Although the loops of SADS-CoVand NL63 CTDs share structural similarity, SADS-CoV cannot use the ACE2as its receptor. Structural alignment of SARS-CoV-2 (colored gray and red), SARS-CoV372373(colored gray and purple) and SADS-CoV CTD (colored green). As a result,this kind of architecture can maximally reduce the surface area of the spikeprotein to the immune system. Moreover, all of the NTDs and CTDs in a \u201claydown\u201d station (closed conformation) can further reduce immune pressure (Fig.2F).
