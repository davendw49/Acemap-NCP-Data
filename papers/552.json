We identify 48transmission events including 21 in Hong Kong and 27 in Shenzhen, among which 40 eventscontain the gender information of the primary cases. The last onset date of the primary casesamong all collected transmission events is February 2, 2020.To explore the temporal patterns and the gender-specific difference of SI, we adopt tworegression models as follows.Model (1): log-linear form for the percentage change, E[ln(SIi,t)] = \u03b11Gi + \u03b12t + \u03b10;\uf0b7\uf0b7andModel (2): linear form for the unit change, E[SIi,t] = \u03b21Gi + \u03b22t + \u03b20.The E[\u2219] is the expectation, and the \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the regression coefficients. The SIi,t representsthe SI of the i-th primary case whose onset date is the t-th day. The Gi denotes the gender ofthe i-th primary case. Hence, the [exp(\u03b12) \u2013 1] \u00d7 100% quantifies the percentage change, and\u03b22 quantifies the unit change (day) in the SI, namely change per day in the calendar date. Thegender-specific difference can be interpreted similarly. We fit both models via the standardleast square approach.In Fig 1, we find that SI had been decreasing by 0.4 (95%CI: 0.1\u22120.7) per day, or 6.2%(95%CI: 0.4\u221211.6%) in percentage, from January 10 to February 2 in Hong Kong andShenzhen. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the SI and calendar date is estimatedat \u22120.37 with p-value < 0.01. The SI of male primary cases is 3.5 days (95%CI: 1.2\u22125.7)shorter than that of a female primary case, or 49.7% (95%CI: 15.3\u221270.1%) less in percentage.To verify, we additionally conduct Cox proportional hazard modelling analysis using similarformula as in models (1) and (2), and calculate the hazard ratio estimates. We find theassociation between SI and calendar date as well as gender-specific difference holdconsistently and significantly.The shortening in SI over time is likely due to the strengthening of the public health controlmeasures. The contact tracing and timely isolation of confirmed COVID-19 infections couldlead to shorter observed SI due to right censoring \u2018bias\u2019 [6, 7]. As such, we call the observedSI under the effects of control measures the effective SI, which has a mean 5.2 days from ourdataset. This appears slightly but not significantly shorter than the previous estimated`intrinsic\u2019 SI with a mean 7.5 days [1]. The mechanism behind the gender difference remainsuncovered, but may be partly due to that male cases are more severe than female cases(\u201cofficials recorded a 2.8% fatality rate for male patients versus 1.7% for women\u201d [8]).
