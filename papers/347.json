Lastly, healthcare-resource-adjusted vulnerability indexes to the 2019-nCoVoutbreak for city i, Vi were obtained as follows: Vi = IDi / Bi, where Bi represents the totalnumber of reserved beds in the designated hospitals.The Figure presents the estimated number of infected individuals, as well as thehealthcareresource-adjusted vulnerability to the 2019-nCoV outbreak across mainland China, as ofJanuary 29, 2020. The epidemiological parameters may have changed after January 23, 2020,when the lockdown measure was implemented. Thus, we only use the data by January 23,2020 and produce the estimation till January 29, 2020 to accommodate the six-day incubationperiod identified by Wu et al.5.The ten most vulnerable non-Hubei cities are also listed in the figure. Note that thecities in Hubei (which are being aided by other provinces) are not presented here because oftheir significantly higher vulnerability as compared to others. Among the ten most vulnerablenon-Hubei cities, Changsha, Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai are major metropolises with alarge number of estimated infected individuals. Xinyang, Jiujiang, Nanchang and Yiyang aremedium-sized cities neighboring Hubei. In particular, Xinyang appears to be in a particularvulnerable situation because of the large number of people traveling from Wuhan and itsinsufficient healthcare resources.The reported vulnerability analysis informs public health response to the 2019-nCoVepidemic in multiple ways. For the identified cities with high vulnerability, it is important toincrease the reserve of healthcare resources or have contingent plans. In particular, some ofthese cities already contributed significant healthcare resources to Hubei, leaving themselvesinadequately prepared for the localized outbreak. Our analysis revealed that severalmedium-sized cities, particularly those neighboring Hubei, are highly vulnerable due to thelack of healthcare resources.1. World Health Organizations.
