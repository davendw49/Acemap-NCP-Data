The outbreak is still on-going with an increasing trendin daily new cases.3, 4 Before the Wuhan lockdown (officialtravel restriction) on January 23, virtually all cases found inother major cities were exported cases from Wuhan. Populationflow data between major cities in mainland China areavailable online due to the rapid development of internet in recentdecades, see https://qianxi.baidu.com/ (in Chinese). In this work,we quantified the association between the domestic travel loadand the number of cases exported from Wuhan to othercityclusters in mainland China. Our city-clusters are the pool oftop five cities in the top 10 provinces (in number of cumulativecases). Thus, we included 10 city-clusters in the analysis, and thedetails of the selected city-clusters can be found in SupplementaryData S1.        We examined the association between the load of domesticpassengers departed from Wuhan and the number of confirmedcases to the 10 city-clusters (including the three municipalities,Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing). Data sets of the daily numbersof domestic passengers were obtained from the location-basedservices database of Baidu company from January 1 to 20.We selected the top 10 provincial regions (except Hubei)with the largest cumulative number of cases, which accountsfor 68% of all cases reported outside Hubei, before theimplementation of the city lockdown, on 23 January 2020.Cases from other provinces are scattered and showed no clearpattern. The daily numbers of passengers from Wuhan to thecity-clusters of each province were adopted to measure theload of domestic passengers departed from Wuhan to thatcluster. From now on, province means the city-clusters in thatprovince. The daily number of cases time series are obtainedvia the online outbreak situation reports.3, 4 Daily cases foreach cluster are scaled from daily province total. The detail isgiven in Supplementary Data. The association was formulated3 days4 days5 days6 days7 daysas follows:log E ci,t= \u03b1i \u00b7 provincei + \u03b2 \u00b7 \u03bei,t\u2212\u03c4 \u00b7 \u03b5t\u2212\u03c4 .(        Here, ci,t represents the daily number of new cases in theith provincial region on day t. The function E(\u00b7) is theexpectation; the \u2018provincei\u2019 denotes the dummy variable for the ithprovincial region in accounting for the heterogenicity amongdifferent provinces, and thus, \u03b1i is a locality-varying interceptionterm. Term \u03be i is the daily number of passengers from Wuhanto the ith province. The time index was denoted by t, and theterm \u03c4 modelled the delay from exposure to being detected.The \u03b5 represented the daily number of new cases in Wuhan.Hence, the product term (\u03be \u00b7\u03b5) was proportional to the rate ofcases exported from Wuhan to other places, and this setting wasconsistent with the framework in Imai et al.,9 which estimatedthe outbreak size through exported 2019-nCoV cases overseas,as well as in more complex frameworks.10 The \u03b2 is theregression coefficient to quantify the association between the load ofpassengers multiplied by the local infectivity in Wuhan and thenumber of cases reported outside Wuhan. Hence, the change rate,denoted by \u0394 = [exp(\u03b2 \u00d7 100) \u2212 1] \u00d7 100%, may be interpretedas the expected percentage change in the daily number of casesoffsite found associated with per 100 increase in the daily numberof passengers departed from Wuhan where there was one newcase daily. We estimated \u03b2 for three means of transportation,and the P-value less than 0.05 was considered as statisticalsignificance.        We also considered a baseline version of the model byreplacing term \u2018\u03b2\u00b7\u03be i,t\u2212\u03c4 \u00b7\u03b5t\u2212\u03c4 \u2019 in Equation (                The likelihood ratio (LR) test was adopted to justify themodel structure in Equation (                The LR test yielded statistically significant outcomes, whichsuggests that the model in Equation (        This analysis has limitations. The data used in this study arein the early phase of the outbreak and may not representsubsequent waves. We aim at quantifying the association betweendomestic travel and 2019-nCoV exportation in China. Althoughthe differences in case ascertainment in different cities clustersare considered in the model by the dummy term \u2018provincei\u2019,the association could also bear heterogeneity. Temporal andspatial correlations were not addressed in this simplemodelling analysis due to lack of data. The 2019-nCoV surveillancedata were too scattered and short at this early stage toconsider temporal and spatial correlation. The correlation betweenpopulation flow, number of cases offsite detected, and sourceinfection prevalence was addressed in this work. Our modellingframework would be extended to a more complex and realisticform for exploring the potential spatial correlations, and benefitfrom more detailed disease surveillance and travel populationflow data.D.H. was supported by General Research Fund (Grant Number15205119) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of HongKong, China.
