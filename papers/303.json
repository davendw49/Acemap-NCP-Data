Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.22%) for COVID19 cases outside of China. The new coronavirus (COVID-19) appears to be fairly transmissible [1], and is spreading in China. Disease severity is a particularly important parameter for understanding this new disease [1], but unfortunately, the case fatality risk (CFR) data from China is difficult to interpret owing to likely missed mild cases (including due to a lack of appropriate test kits early in the epidemic) and also the likely delay in deaths occurring. Such a prolonged time course is suggested by a case series of 138 cases from Wuhan, China with cases enrolled between 1-28 January 2020. For this group on 3 February, 62% were still hospitalised and 31% (11/36) of those admitted to ICU were still there (6 had died) [2]. In jurisdictions outside China (and excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) the CFR as detailed in the 13 February WHO Report [3] was 1/447 = 0.22% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.40% to 1.26%). But this estimate also did not account for possible missed mild cases in those countries or the lag time between hospitalisation and death. One possible way to get a better estimate of the CFR is to consider the proportion of cases currently in intensive care units (ICUs) in settings outside China where the healthcare system is working relatively normally (ie, is not over-burdened by the epidemic). As per Table 1 we estimated that 4.0% (14/349) of identified cases were in ICUs in all the countries outside of China that had 20+ cases.", "text": "5033Estimatedproportionin ICU16% (8/50)1/33(assumed asper \u201cseriouscondition\u201d)conveyance(specificallythe cruiseship\u201cDiamondmoored inConfirmedcases as of13 February[3]2928174 (updatedto 218 lateron 13Estimatedproportionin ICU0/250/23 (seecomments)5/218 (seecomments)4.0%(14/349)currently isolated are in stable condition.\u201d\u2026\u201done patientwas discharged from a hospital yesterday after he wascured\u201d. Based on a news report on 6 February [7].Based on a news report on 13 February [8]: \u201cKato saidfive people from the ship are currently in seriouscondition in hospital\u201d. A prior report on 12 February inthe same news source gave more detail for the first fourpeople where the Health Minister (Katsunobu Kato) wasreported saying: \"At this point, we have confirmed thatfour people, among those who are hospitalised, are in aserious condition, either on a ventilator or in an intensivecare unit.\" [9]Next we considered the typical survival of people admitted to ICUs with severe respiratoryconditions. We used data from a meta-analysis of trials comparing higher vs lower levels ofpositive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in adults with acute lung injury or acute respiratorydistress syndrome (ARDS) [10]. This study found 374 hospital deaths in 1136 patients(32.9%) assigned to treatment with higher PEEP and 409 hospital deaths in 1163 patients(35.2%) assigned to lower PEEP (with no significant difference between these two groups).Combining these data suggests a CFR in such patients with acute lung injury of 34.1%(783/2299). This estimate is a little less than one case series of ICU patients with acuterespiratory failure from Influenza A (H1N1) and requiring mechanical ventilation, who had aCFR of 46% (156/337) [11]. Another study of such ICU patients with influenza found alower overall CFR of 26% (492/1859) [12] and another one reported a CFR of 24%(177/733) [13]. Furthermore, in a group of 340 ICU patients with ARDS, the CFR at 90 dayswas 32% in a group given a neuromuscular blocker and 41% in the placebo group [14].We then applied the 34.1% value from the meta-analysis to the data in Table 1, giving anestimated CFR of 1.37% ([14 x 34.1%]/349) for COVID-19. The 95% confidence interval(CI) of this estimate is 0.57% to 3.22%. This estimate can be considered a symptomatic CFR(sCFR) as it likely to be based on a denominator who had symptoms and were tested andlaboratory-confirmed as cases. This estimate is almost invariably higher than theinfectionfatality risk (IFR) which can only be estimated when serological testing becomes available toidentify all of those infected [15].Decision-makers and disease modellers might still be best to assume that the \u2018true\u2019 CFR isless than our estimate here as mild cases may not be identified. Furthermore, if a specifictreatment is identified in the near future, then cases could have improved survival and theCFR might decline. On the other hand, if health systems became overloaded with theCOVID-19 epidemic, then the CFR could likely increase for both the community and inhospital cases. As there is further progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, ongoing work willbe needed to better clarify both transmissibility and the CFR, so that the likely mortalityburden can be estimated. The method we have used here for CFR estimation will only bevalid prior to healthcare systems becoming overloaded, after which they are likely to changetheir ICU admission policies.Our provisional CFR estimate for COVID-19 is less than that estimated for MERS-CoV andSARS-CoV, but is broadly comparable with two of the three previous influenza pandemics(when considering the range of estimated values) (Table 2).CFR34.4%9.6%0.5% to5.3%dependingonagegroup1.5% (0.6%to 3.5%)0% to 1.2%(but mainly0.05% to0.005%)old (70 to 74 years, 5.3%) [18].

Nevertheless, \u201cmost of the estimates in thiscategory [symptomatic cases] fell in the range of 5 to 50deaths per 100,000 cases.\u201d0.2%10.11.12.13.Cowling BJ, Leung GM.
