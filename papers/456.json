Otherhuman coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratoryinfections (eg, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43,and HCoV-HKU1). MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV andSARS-CoV-2, can cause highly lethal disease in humans.MERS-CoV is a large single-strand positive-sense RNAvirus (gfiure 1). 14\u201318 The 30\u201331 kb coronavirus genomeencodes a large number of proteins, which might conferversatility in adapting to new environments and enhancecross-species transmission. MERS-CoV has four structuralproteins: spike (S) protein, envelope (E)protein, membrane(M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein.

Dromedary camels are a hostreservoir species for the MERS-CoV (appendix pp 3\u20135).20\u201323Humans can acquire MERS-CoV through direct orindirect contact with infected dromedary camels orinfected patients19\u201330 (figure 4A). However not all casesinfected in the community report contact withdromedary camels (appendix p 4\u20135). The transmission ofMERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans isnow well documented in the Arabian Peninsula,23\u201325 butthe extent to which this transmission is occurringin countries outside the Arabian Peninsula requiresdefinition. Experimental infections have shown thatinfected dromedaries shed MERS-CoV from their nasalsecretions with minimal signs of illness, which islimited to rhinorrhoea.27\u201329 Full-genome phylogeneticanalysis indicates that evolution of diverse MERS-CoVlineages in camels have caused human infections,perpetuating a low barrier for interspeciestransmission.21,29,30 However, African MERS-CoV lineages incamels imported into Saudi Arabia have not establishedthemselves in camels in Saudi Arabia,9,30 indicatingpotential diferences in transmission dynamics andselection pressure.

Individuals with severe primaryMERS-CoV infections are often older than 65 yearswith comorbidities, and symptoms can present late.Individuals with mild primary MERS-CoV infections areoften missed by current surveillance systems since theyusually do not present to health-care facilities.Secondary cases have resulted from human-to-humantransmission among close contacts. To date, secondarytransmission has occasionally occurred between closecontacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmedMERS-CoV in household settings.33,34 However, secondarytransmission in health-care facilities has repeatedlyoccurred in several countries and has, on occasion,resulted in large outbreaks (appendix p 5)\u2014such asIncubation periodMean: 5\u00b72 days(95% CI 1\u00b79\u201314\u00b77)Range 2\u201314 daysSex distributionMales 64%, females 36%Abnormal investigationsImaging: chest x-ray and CT changesLeucopeniaLymphopeniaThrombocytopeniaElevated LDHElevated ALTElevated ASTComplicationsSevere acute respiratory syndromeRespiratory failureLiver failureRenal failureMultiorgan failureSeptic shockFactors associated with increased mortalityComorbidities:DiabetesChronic lung disease (COPD, asthma)Chronic kidney diseaseChronic liver diseaseChronic heart diseaseMalignanciesImmunosuppressive drugsAge >65 yearsPresence of pleural effusionLow serum albuminCase fatality rateOverall (global): 36\u00b70%Saudi arabia: 41.8% (22%\u201369%)South korea: 20\u00b74% (14\u00b75\u201347%)MERS-CoV host cell DPP4 receptor found in:broncial epithelium, lung parenchyma, interstitium (endothelial cells),kidneys, intestines, liver, thymus, haemopoetic cells (leukocytes,macrophages, dendritic cells, mononuclear lymphoid cells)InhalationIngestionOther routes(haematogenous or lymphaticspread to other organs)Presenting symptomsGeneralFever (>38oC)Chills or rigoursLethargyAnorexiaMalaise, lethargyMyalgiaBody achesCNSHeadacheConfusionUpper respiratory tractRunny noseSneezingSore or tickly throatLower respiratory tractCough (dry or productivewith sputum)Shortness of breathChest painHaemoptysisGastrointestinal tractDecreased appetiteNauseaVomitingDiarrhoeaAbdominal painAbdominal discomfortAnimal and environmental sourcesMERS-CoV-infected camelsCamel nasal secretionsCamel excreta (urine, saliva andfaeces)Camelid birth products (amnioticfluid, fetal membranes and placenta)Camel food products (milk, meat)Other unknown?Human sourcesSymptomatic and subclinicalMERS-positive individuals in:The communityFamily householdsFamily compoundsHostelsHealth-care facilities and hospitalsCamel farmsUp to 25% report direct or indirectcontact with camels and approximately50% are the result of human-to-humantransmissionKnown risk factors for MERS-CoV acquisition,transmission, and outbreaks are noted (panel 1). MERS patientdata reported to WHO includes information onexposures and known risk factors during the 14 days beforesymptom onset, or during the 14 days before laboratoryconfirmation was reported (in the case of asymptomaticinfection). Exposure data include travel history toMERS-CoV endemic countries, direct or indirect contactwith dromedary camels or their products, contact withhumans with MERS-CoV infection, and visits tohealthcare facilities containing patients infected withMERSCoV are risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV infection(appendix pp 4\u20135).2,24,25,31\u201345 MERS-CoV has been detectedin camel products (eg, raw milk, meat, blood, urine, orbirth products); however, genomic studies to definitivelyshow transmission from these products to humans havenot yet been done. Human primary intestinal epithelialcells, small intestine explants, and the intestinal tract arehighly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain viralreplication. After infection of mice transgenic for theexpression of the host DPP4 receptor, histologicalexamination showed MERS-CoV enteric infection in allinoculated mice with progression to infection of thelung tissues, indicating the development of sequentialrespiratory infection.39Transmission via contact with contaminated hospitalenvironments is possible during outbreaks, althoughgenomic studies providing an evidence base are lacking.Since environmental contamination is a potential sourceof infection, it is prudent to take precautionary infectioncontrol measures.Health-care-associated outbreaks of MERS-CoV afectinginpatients, health-care workers, and visitors arecharacteristic of MERS (panel 2) and account for approximately50% of reported cases.2,20,21,33,40\u201345 Large nosocomialoutbreaks have occurred in Abu Dhabi in United ArabPanel 1: Risk factors for MERS-CoV infection, transmission, and outbreaks21,34,38,132\u2013138Community risk factors\u2022 Indirect or direct contact with MERS-CoV-infected camels, camel nasal secretions,milk, urine, faeces, meat, or birthing products\u2022 Travel to the Middle East and contact with camels or attendance at a health facility\u2022 Exposure to, or contact with, patients with MERS-CoV in the community, or athealthcare facilities\u2022 Underlying chronic medical conditionsNosocomial risk factors for human-to-human transmission and outbreakamplification\u2022 Late diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection\u2022 Lack of awareness in health-care workers of the possibility of MERS in patients with afever\u2022 Overcrowded or contaminated health-care facilities, especially emergencydepartments, dialysis units, and crowded inpatient wards\u2022 Exposure of hospital staf or other patients to symptomatic patients with MERS\u2022 Delayed implementation of infection control measures\u2022 Poor compliance with MERS-specific infection control guidelines (hand hygiene,droplet and contact precautions, environmental cleaning)\u2022 Poor compliance with appropriate personal protective equipment when assessingpatients with febrile respiratory illness\u2022 Aerosol-generating procedures or invasive procedures in patients with MERS(eg, nebulisers, resuscitation, intubation, and ventilation)\u2022 Lack of proper isolation room facilities\u2022 Distance between patient beds of less than 1 m\u2022 Friends and family members staying as caregivers in overcrowded health-carefacilitiesMERS=Middle East respiratory syndrome.

The 2013 outbreak inAl Hasa, Saudi Arabia, involved 23 people in threediferent hospitals and was linked to poor infectioncontrol practices, aerosol-generating procedures,continuous positive pressure ventilation, andcardiopulmonary resuscitation.42 In June, 2017, an outbreak of34 MERS-CoV cases (including 17 in health-care workers)occurred in a hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,43 wherethe primary case was a 47-year-old man admitted foremergency intubation. Before a diagnosis of MERS, thisindividual had contact with 220 health-care workers,patients, and visitors. Another 2017 outbreak in Riyadhinvolved three hospitals, with 44 MERS cases in patients,health-care workers, and family members. The outbreakarose from three severely ill people who were diagnosedwith MERS late in the disease course, and involved in asuperspreading event.44 In 2015, South Korea had thelargest MERS-CoV outbreak outside the Middle Eastwith 186 cases reported, resulting from a single importedcase from an individual who had returned fromtravelling in the Middle East. The outbreak included185 secondary cases who acquired infection in 16healthcare facilities and 80% of transmission events wereattributed to five superspreading events. 45The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis ofMERS-CoV remain to be defined because autopsies aregenerally not done either for religious and culturalreasons or to prevent environmental contamination withsubsequent infection of health-care workers. Therefore,there are few data on the histopathological changes inpatients with MERS-CoV infection, even in severedisease.46,47 The only two autopsies available show thatviral infection was confined predominantly to the respiratory tract, although viral particles were detected in thekidney in one of the reports.47 Further, ex vivo humankidney cultures were shown to support productiveMERS-CoV infection.48 However, it is not known whetherinfection of this organ contributes to worse outcomescompared with infections confined to the respiratorytract. Viral RNA, but not infectious MERS-CoV, wasdetected in the blood for at least 2 weeks after diagnosis.Whether this viral RNA represented an extrapulmonaryinfection is not clear, since MERS-CoV neutralisingantibody was detected in the serum at the same time insome patients.49Pathological changes in the lungs include evidenceof focal haemorrhagic necrotising pneumonia withexudative difuse alveolar damage, indistinguishablefrom findings detected in severe pneumonia caused byother viral agents.Several experimentally infected animal models forMERS have been developed (appendix p 6).50,51 Methodsfor gene silencing and editing are being furtherdeveloped, therefore it is likely that additional viral andhost factors important in MERS-CoV pathogenesis willbe identified.MERS-CoV pathogenesis reflects a balance betweencoronavirus-induced protective and pathogenic hostimmune responses and direct cytotoxic efects of thevirus.52 According to studies of patients infected withSARS-CoV and of mice and other animals infectedexperimentally with MERS-CoV, successful resolutionof MERS and long-term protection from re-infectionlikely requires well coordinated innate and adaptiveB-cell and T-cell responses. In patients with SARS,innate immune responses characterised by an extendedperiod of cytokine secretion (eg, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) wascorrelated with delayed antibody responses and poormanagement outcomes; this prolonged innate responsehas not yet been shown in patients infected withMERS-CoV.53 MERS-CoV productively infects activatedhuman T cells and induces delayed cytokine responsesafter infection of human myeloid cells in vitro, both ofwhich could impair virus clearance and the developmentof an efective immune response. 54\u201356During the acute phase of MERS, robust virus-specicfiCD8 T-cell responses were detected in most patients withsevere or moderate disease, with antibody and CD4 T-cellresponses appearing later in the disease course.57 T-celland antibody responses were reliably detected 2\u20133 weeksafter diagnosis, although they were detected earlier insome patients.49,57 Studies of MERS survivors showedthat MERS-CoV-specicfi antibody responses tended to belower and transient in patients with mild or subclinicaldisease when compared with patients with severe disease,in whom MERS-CoV-specicfi antibody responses weredetected for at least 2 years.57\u201360 In contrast, T-cell responseswere detected in all MERS survivors for at least 2 years.59The transitory nature of the antibody response in milddisease and greater stability of the T-cell response suggestthat induction of both will be required for optimallongterm protection; the measurement of both will enhancethe accuracy of prevalence studies.The specicfi exposures that lead to sporadic MERS-CoVinfections are unknown, therefore it is impossibleto estimate the incubation period in primary cases.However, based on data from cases of human-to-humantransmission, the incubation period is a median of5\u20137 days, with a range of 2\u201314 days (median 5\u00b72 days[95% CI 1\u00b79\u201314\u00b77]).2,10,21,61\u201363 Immunocompromised patientscan present with longer incubation periods of up to20 days.64The clinical presentation of patients infected withMERS-CoV ranges from asymptomatic or mild upperrespiratory illness to rapidly progressive pneumonitis,respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome,septic shock, and multiorgan failure with fatal outcome(figure 5). 2,10,11,61\u201370 It is not possible to distinguish patientswith a legitimate asymptomatic MERS-CoV infectionfrom those who develop mild disease because reportsto WHO provide signs and symptoms informationonly at the time of reporting. Many individuals remainasymptomatic whereas some go on to develop milddisease, which is why WHO classifies these individualsas mild or asymptomatic. Asymptomatic-to-mildinfection rates of 25\u201350% have been reported.The signs and symptoms associated with MERS arenon-specicfi, with or without multisystem involvement,and thus could be mistaken for other causes of respiratorytract or gastrointestinal illnesses.2,10,11,61\u201370 Therefore, theclinical diagnosis of MERS can be easily missed. Patientswith MERS can typically present with fever, chills, rigors,headache, a non-productive cough, sore throat, arthralgia,and myalgia followed by dyspnoea. Other associatedsymptoms include coryza, nausea, vomiting, dizziness,sputum production, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain.Some patients with MERS can present with atypicalsymptoms of mild respiratory illness without a fever and agastrointestinal illness that precedes the development ofpneumonia.64,67,68 Neuromuscular manifestations include\u2022 Anti-viral therapeutics including host-directed therapies or immune-based therapiesare in development.\u2022 Vaccinating dromedary camels, the source for primary human infection, is a proposedapproach to preventing human infection.\u2022 A recombinant camelpox virus expressing the S protein has been shown to induceneutralising antibodies in camels.\u2022 As compared to older camels, juvenile camels have higher rates of viral shedding.Past infection is not protective.\u2022 Basic hand hygiene practices.\u2022 Gloves and face masks when handling infected camels and camel products.\u2022 Pasteurising camel milk.\u2022 Avoid ingesting raw camel meat, dairy products, or urine.\u2022 Vaccine development for people with high camel exposure.Human cases\u2022 High clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection and making earlydiagnosis.\u2022 Isolate suspected cases early and institute infection control measures.\u2022 Face masks and hand hygiene measures for all HCW and family contacts.\u2022 Occupationally exposed people have a higher risk of infection compared to the generalpublic.

Acuteand severe respiratory illness (ie, a fatal outcome aftermultiorgan failure) has been noted in only two of38 reported paediatric cases and these were in boysaged 9 months and 2 years with comorbidities (infantilenephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis, respectively). 71\u201374Data on the prevalence of MERS-CoV in pregnantwomen are limited to case reports, and the clinicalpresentations and mortality rates are similar tononpregnant women.75MERS should be kept on the diferential diagnosis listfor ill travellers returning home from MERS-CoVendemic areas who present with acute febrile illness(temperature \u226538\u00b0C), aches and pains, headache, cough,dyspnoea, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, unexplainedleucopenia (white blood cell count <3\u00b75 \u00d7 110\u2079/L), andthrombocytopenia (platelets <150 \u00d7 10\u2079/L)\u2014either withor without prominent respiratory symptoms.2,10,11,61\u201370 It isimportant that clinicians are alert to the possibility thatpatients could have MERS in all health-care settingswhere the virus is circulating so that an accuratediagnosis can be made and infection control measuresimplemented eficiently. 76The type and quality of the clinical specimen are importantin the laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection.Both upper respiratory tract specimens (oropharyngeal ornasopharyngeal swabs) and lower respiratory tractspecimens (sputum, endotracheal aspirate or lavage) should beanalysed whenever possible.77\u201379 Patients with MERS mightnot shed the virus during the early stage of their illness;thus, initial negative results from upper respiratory samplesdo not rule out the possibility of MERS and patients shouldbe retested using a lower respiratory tract sample. Severalstudies of MERS-CoV viral load measurements show thatupper respiratory tract specimens have lower viral loadsthan lower respiratory specimens.11,12,79,80 MERS-CoV RNAhas been detected in blood, urine, and stool\u2014but at muchlower viral loads than in the respiratory tract.81,82Clinical specimens must be collected by trained stafusing appropriate personal protective equipment\u2014eg, when taking nasopharyngeal and oropharyngealspecimens, Dacron or rayon swabs specifically designedfor collecting specimens for virology must be used.77,78,83These swab kits should contain virus transport medium.A single negative test result does not exclude thediagnosis and repeat sampling and testing is stronglyrecommended.83 A minimum of two samples, preferablyfrom the lower respiratory tract, are needed to excludeMERS-CoV after initial assessment. To confirm clearanceof the virus, respiratory samples should be collectedsequentially (every 2 to 4 days) over ensuing days untilthere are two consecutive negative results at least 24 hapart in people who are clinically recovered.77WHO guidelines for testing should be followed.77MERS-CoV testing must be performed in appropriatelyequipped biosafety laboratories by staf trained in therelevant technical and safety procedures. National orWHO guidelines on the laboratory biosafety should befollowed in all circumstances.83Three real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for routinedetection of MERS-CoV have been developed targetingupstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open readingframe (ORF)1b and ORF1a. The assay for the upE targetis considered highly sensitive and is recommended forscreening, with the ORF1a assay (ORF1a assay isconsidered more sensitive than ORF1b assay).77An updated roadmap for MERS-CoV productdevelopment lists all available diagnostics and other diagnosticsin the developmental phase.84 Several diagnostic tests areunder development to accelerate turnaround times fromsample analysis to result.85\u201387 A 2018 rapid and specificassay for the detection of MERS-CoV combines thereverse transcription loop-mediated isothermalampliifcation technique and a vertical flow visualisationstrip (RT-LAMP-VF) to detect the nucleocapsid gene ofMERS-CoV.86 The RT-LAMP-VF assay provides detectionof MERS-CoV within 35 min and is easier to performthan the WHO-recommended rRT-PCR method.86Several serological assays are available for detectionof MERS-CoV: ELISA, recombinant spikeimmunolfuorescent assay, and spike pseudoparticle neutralisationand microneutralisation assay.87\u201390 A case confirmedby serology requires evidence of seroconversion intwo samples, ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by ascreening (eg, ELISA, immunofluorescence assay) and aneutralisation assay.77,78A range of abnormal but non-specific chest x-rayifndings are seen in patients with MERS. 91,92 Theseabnormalities include unilateral or bilateralbronchovascular shadowing, interstitial infiltrates, reticularopacities, reticulonodular shadowing, nodules, pleuralefusions, and patchy to confluent consolidation(appendix pp 18\u201319). Lower lobes tend to be afectedmore than upper lobes early in the course of MERS andrapid opacification of lungs and progression to acuterespiratory distress syndrome can occur.High-resolution CT might show ground glass opacities(gfiure 5B) in early CT nfidings (with or without consolidation) followed by interlobular septal and intralobularinterstitial thickening with peripheral and lower lobeinvolvement93,94 within the rfist week of MERS-CoV infection. During subsequent weeks, a so-called crazy-pavinglung abnormality, cavitation, tree-in-bud pattern andcentrilobular nodules, constrictive obliterative bronchiolitis,bronchiolitis obliterans, peribronchiolar air-trapping,thickened peripheral bronchioles, and organising pneumoniahave been observed.95Currently, there are no specicfi anti-MERS-CoV therapiesavailable for human use. The mainstay of clinicalmanagement of MERS cases is mostly symptomfocused, providing supportive care10,61 with pain and fevermanagement, treating concomitant or secondarybacterial infections, and supporting vital organ functions.Mild MERS cases can be managed at home.96 Predictivefactors for development of pneumonia include older age(>56 years), high fever, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia,C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL, and ahigh viral load in sputum (threshold cycle value ofrRT-PCR <28\u00b75).10,70 Respiratory failure and acute kidneyinjury (with haematuria and proteinuria) are commonamong patients admitted for hospital care because ofthe severity of their disease and who require mechanicalventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, anddialyses.10,61,70Several empirical treatments have been studied inseverely ill patients. Therapies used for severely illpatients with MERS have included convalescent plasma,corticosteroids, antiviral agents (eg, interferons andribavirin), and protease inhibitors, or combination ofmembers from these groups. A systematic review of30 publications on therapeutic agents used for MERStreatment in various outbreaks showed a completeabsence of an accurate evidence base and emphasisedthe need for controlled trials.97Several agents have shown inhibitory efects againstMERS-CoV in cell cultures, including interferons,ribavirin, ciclosporin, and mycophenolic acid.98\u2013105 Empiricallopinavir\u2013ritonavir, pegylated interferon alfa-2a, andribavirin have been used for serious cases, but no eficacydata are yet available. There is an ongoing randomisedclinical trial in progress in Saudi Arabia (the MIRACLEtrial; NCT02845843) comparing lopinavir\u2013ritonavir,recombinant interferon beta, and standard supportivecare against placebo and standard supportive care inpatients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiringhospital admission. This recursive, multicentre,placebocontrolled, double-blind, randomised controlled trial isdesigned to include two components, each consisting oftwo stages. The first two-stage component is designed toadjust sample size and determine futility stopping,but not eficacy stopping (n=34). The second two-stagecomponent is designed to determine eficacy stoppingand possibly readjustment of sample size.The use of plasma from patients with MERS who havemade a full recovery (convalescent plasma) requiresclinical trial evaluation. Preclinical animal data showthat transfer of serum samples fromMERS-CoVimmune camels to infected mice resulted in reducedweight loss and lung histopathology,106 thus suggestingtherapeutic potential. In the 2015 Korean outbreak,three of 13 patients with MERS with respiratory failurewere given four infusions of convalescent plasma.107Two of three showed neutralising activity. Donorplasma with a plaque reduction neutralisation test(PRNT) titre of 1/80 had a meaningful serologicalresponse after convalescent plasma infusion, while thatwith a PRNT titre of 1/40 did not. The authors concludethat for efective convalescent plasma infusion inpatients with MERS, donor plasma with a neutralisationactivity of a PRNT titre greater than or equal to 1/80should be used.Antibiotic therapy is commonly started empirically inseriously ill patients. A retrospective study of 136 patientswith MERS found that macrolide therapy resulted inno reduction in mortality or faster MERS-CoV RNAclearance compared with those who were not treatedwith macrolides.108For serious cases, hospital inpatient care is required toreduce the risk of complications such as organ failureand secondary infections. Non-invasive ventilation isassociated with a high failure rate (92%) in patients withacute hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to MERS-CoVinfection.109 Patients with severe symptoms might needto be managed in an intensive care unit, wherelungprotective ventilatory strategies for acute respiratorydistress syndrome, inotropic support, antimicrobial therapyfor co-infections, and renal replacement therapy foracute renal failure can be provided.Studies show no benetfi from the use of systemiccorticosteroids.

A phase 1,rfist-inhuman, single site, randomised, double-blind,placebocontrolled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of singleascending doses of a co-administered monoclonal antibodiesREGN3048 and REGN3051 administered intravenously inhealthy adult volunteers (NCT03301090) is ongoing andstudy duration will be approximately 16 months. Anotherstudy is comparing patients who received extracorporealmembrane oxygenation (ECMO) support with those whodid not receive ECMO support (NCT02627378). Severalmonoclonal and polyclonal neutralising antibodyproducts, including novel chimeric camel or humanheavychain antibodies, are protective in animal models,110\u2013112 andtheir potential use for pre-exposure or post-exposureprophylaxis in outbreak management requires evaluationsin controlled trials.In a mental health study, 7\u00b76% of 1656 patients whowere quarantined showed symptoms of anxiety, and6\u00b74% reported feelings of anger during the 2 weeks ofquarantine.113 Mental health support, accurateinformation, and appropriate supplies, including food, clothes,and accommodation, should be provided to people whofeel isolated.Several studies have reported disease severity andmortality risk factor data from patients in the MiddleEast and South Korea.11,12,21,114\u2013117 Ahmed and colleaguescollected the daily information on MERS-CoV casesposted online by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Healthbetween Dec 2, 2014, and Nov 12, 2016, and reviewed660 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS. 114 They showedmortality at day 3 (13\u00b78%), day 30 (28\u00b73%), and overall(29\u00b78%). Patients older than 60 years were more likely todie (45\u00b72% mortality) from their infections than wereyounger patients (20%).          Several factors are associated with severe disease andhigh mortality rates in patients with MERS. These factorsinclude male sex, comorbid pre-existing illnesses (suchas obesity, diabetes mellitus, cancer, chronic heart, lung,and kidney disease, and immunocompromised states),low serum albumin, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia,concomitant infections, and positive plasma MERS-CoVRNA. DPP4 receptors are upregulated in the lungs ofsmokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease, which might explain why patients withcomorbid lung diseases are prone to severe illness.1          \u2022 Creation of a One Health multidisciplinary consortia inMiddle Eastern and African countries to tackle zoonoticspread of MERS-CoV between animals, humans, and theenvironment and to monitor, respond to, and preventmajor outbreaks\u2022 Establishing efective One Health research and surveillancecollaborations between a range of expertise including publichealth oficers, physicians, veterinarians, animal husbandryspecialists, agriculturalists, ecologists, phylogeneticists,trialists, and basic scientistsPriority studies in dromedary camels:\u2022 Natural history studies that evaluate evidence of re-infection\u2022 Value chain and production system analyses\u2022 Improving surveillance to evaluate any seasonal or temporalvariation in viral shedding\u2022 Identifying important points for interventions andinterruption of within-species and zoonotic transmission\u2022 Accelerating the development of camel vaccine candidatesPriority studies at the animal\u2013human\u2013environmentalinterface:\u2022 Real-time mapping of virus circulation and geographicalrange of MERS-CoV infection in humans and dromedarycamels\u2022 Development of new accurate and accessible point-of-carediagnostic tests for outbreak containment, casemanagement, and surveillance\u2022 Evaluating geographical extent of spillover from animals tohumans in Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia\u2022 Animal and human serological, virological, and genomicstudies in specific locations to evaluate risk factors forhuman infection and exact routes of zoonotic transmission,including food and oral routes\u2022 Social science and anthropological studies to describe andquantify exposures to dromedary camels and identifyopportunities for risk-mitigating interventionsPriority studies in human populations:\u2022 Accelerating research and development, implementation,and evaluation of medical countermeasures to reducemorbidity and mortality associated with MERS (especially inhigh risk comorbid populations)\u2022 Identifying optimal interventions for reducing infectionamong health-care workers in hospital settings\u2022 Determining the role of asymptomatic cases in transmissionof infections in humans and whether any specificbehaviours can result in human infection from non-humansources\u2022 Targeted epidemiological studies in clinical settings tobetter understand immune response and duration ofinfectiousness and address the long-term medical andpsychological complications in MERS survivors\u2022 Integrating testing for MERS-CoV into existing respiratorydisease surveillance systems to identify extent andspectrum of mild infection in the communityPriority studies for vaccines, therapeutics, and rapiddiagnostics:\u2022 Accelerating the development of human MERS-CoV vaccinecandidates\u2022 Accelerating development of MERS-CoV therapeuticpipeline and host-directed therapies\u2022 Development of new accurate and accessible diagnostictests for outbreak containment, case management, andsurveillance\u2022 Increased donor investment into research and developmentfor: novel point-of-care testing options, syndromic panelsfor diferential diagnosis, a greater understanding of viraland antibody kinetics, improved access to clinicalspecimens, and establishment of international referencestandardsAdapted from the FAO-OIE-WHO MERS Technical Working Group\u2019s report on MERS(2018). MERS=Middle East respiratory syndrome. 31MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratorysyndrome coronavirus.19\u00b74% (36 of 186 patients), 7-day mortality (fromsymptom onset) was 3\u00b78% (seven of 186), and 28-day mortalitywas 17\u00b77% (33 of 186).11,12 Host factors associated withmortality in this outbreak were older age (>60 years),smoking history, pre-existing pneumonia, abnormalrenal function, and comorbidity. Low albumin, alteredmentality, and high pneumonia severity index score atadmission were risk factors for mortality.In a study of long-term efects after recovery fromMERS,119 patients with severe illness who were admittedto intensive care reported higher limitations in somemeasure of their quality of life than patients with lesssevere illness who were managed in medical wards. Thelong-term consequences of MERS illness on survivorsappear to be similar to those caused by other viral causesof severe acute respiratory infections such as influenza, parainfluenza, and metapneumovirus. 120 Follow-upimaging studies of patients who recover from MERSindicate that lung fibrosis might develop in a substantialnumber of patients.95The prevention of transmission of MERS-CoV in thecommunity and in health-care settings is crucial topreventing outbreaks and further spread. Several substantivereviews and WHO guidelines are available on thesubject.21,61,76,96It is important to maintain good personal andenvironmental hygiene, and to implement stringentcontact and droplet precautions among health-careworkers. To prevent community transmission, contacttracing, quarantine or isolation of close contacts, andthe Middle East and in humans at high risk of acquiringcommunity and nosocomial MERS-CoV infection.public education are important measures.20,60In hospitals, early case detection followed by isolationis essential, ideally in negative pressure isolation rooms.The main infection prevention and control measures formanaging patients with MERS are well documentedfrom the SARS epidemic and from experiences frommanaging MERS outbreaks (appendix pp 7\u20138).Advances in technology, vaccine platforms, clinical trialdesigns, and bioinformatics are supporting MERS-CoVvaccine development (appendix 8\u20139). WHO target productprolfies for MERS-CoV vaccines calls for the developmentof three types of MERS vaccines: a human vaccine forlong-term protection of people at high exposure risk, suchas health-care workers and those working with potentiallyinfected camels; a human vaccine for reactive use inoutbreak settings; and a dromedary camel vaccine toprevent zoonotic transmission.121 Multiple types of vaccinecandidates are in development including inactivatedwhole virus, live attenuated virus, viral vectored vaccines,subunit vaccines, and DNA vaccines.121,122 Most vaccinesuse the S protein or the domain of the S protein requiredfor binding to host DPP4 as an immunogen, sinceneutralising antibodies are mostly directed to the receptorbinding domain.WHO, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, andWorld Organization for Animal Health, in consultationwith global MERS community, identiefid knowledge gapsand priorities for MERS research, surveillance,management, and control (panel 4).31Several recent publications have highlighted theimportance of a one-human-environmental-animal-health(One Health) approach to tackle and control the spread ofMERS-CoV (appendix p 9).31,121\u2013126MERS-CoV is a pathogen with epidemic potential thatcontinues to cause sporadic human disease and remainson the WHO Blueprint 2020 priority list.4 Given thatMERS-CoV appears to be highly endemic amongdromedary camels from geographically widespread areas of theMiddle East and Africa, zoonotic transmission withconsequent risk of human epidemics will most likelycontinue for years to come.8,9 MERS-CoV endemic andat-risk countries must invest more in surveillance, inpublic health research, and in medical interventions\u2014including human and camel vaccine development. Thecontinued risk of human MERS-CoV outbreaks 7 yearsafter its first discovery, efective human and camelMERS-CoV vaccines appear to be the ideal way to preventcontinuing spread of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels inContributorsThis paper was conceptualised by ZAM and AZ.

MERS-CoV is a large single-strand positive-sense RNAvirus (gfiure 1). 19DPP4 is less abundant in the nasal cavity and epithelialcells of the upper airways but is highly expressed on the Geographical distributionepithelial cells of the distal airways and type I and II Laboratory-conrfimed MERS-CoV human infections 19 arepneumocytes in the lung alveoli, non-ciliated bronchial reported to WHO as a requirement under the Internationalepithelial cells, endothelial cells, and some haemopoietic Health Regulations (2005). reported by Saudi Arabia (2106 cases, 780 deaths).The origin of all primary human MERS-CoV infectionsremains unknown. 2 Primary cases often report direct orindirect contact with dromedary camels and presentacross a wide clinical spectrum from mild to severefulminant disease. Secondary cases have resulted from human-to-humantransmission among close contacts. Exposure data include travel history toMERS-CoV endemic countries, direct or indirect contactwith dromedary camels or their products, contact withhumans with MERS-CoV infection, and visits tohealthcare facilities containing patients infected withMERSCoV are risk factors for acquiring MERS-CoV infection(appendix pp 4\u20135).2,24,25,31\u201345 MERS-CoV has been detectedin camel products (eg, raw milk, meat, blood, urine, orbirth products); however, genomic studies to definitivelyshow transmission from these products to humans havenot yet been done. Human primary intestinal epithelialcells, small intestine explants, and the intestinal tract arehighly susceptible to MERS-CoV and can sustain viralreplication. Since environmental contamination is a potential sourceof infection, it is prudent to take precautionary infectioncontrol measures. Emirates, Seoul in South Korea and several cities inSaudi Arabia (appendix p 5). Therefore,there are few data on the histopathological changes inpatients with MERS-CoV infection, even in severedisease.46,47 The only two autopsies available show thatviral infection was confined predominantly to the respiratory tract, although viral particles were detected in thekidney in one of the reports.47 Further, ex vivo humankidney cultures were shown to support productiveMERS-CoV infection.48 However, it is not known whetherinfection of this organ contributes to worse outcomescompared with infections confined to the respiratorytract. Asymptomatic-to-mildinfection rates of 25\u201350% have been reported. The signs and symptoms associated with MERS arenon-specicfi, with or without multisystem involvement,and thus could be mistaken for other causes of respiratorytract or gastrointestinal illnesses.2,10,11,61\u201370 Therefore, theclinical diagnosis of MERS can be easily missed. A single negative test result does not exclude thediagnosis and repeat sampling and testing is stronglyrecommended.83 A minimum of two samples, preferablyfrom the lower respiratory tract, are needed to excludeMERS-CoV after initial assessment. Antibiotic therapy is commonly started empirically inseriously ill patients.
