Involved in the formation of thecoronavirus replication complex, the viral main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) represents anattractive target for therapy. We determined the crystal structure of the unliganded Mpro at 1.75 \u00c5resolution and used this structure to guide optimization of a series of alpha-ketoamide inhibitors.The main goal of the optimization efforts was improvement of the pharmacokinetic properties of thecompounds. We further describe 1.95- and 2.20-\u00c5 crystal structures of the complex between theenzyme and the most potent alpha-ketoamide optimized this way. These structures will form thebasis for further development of these compounds to antiviral drugs.Since December 2019, a new coronavirus has been emerging in the city of Wuhan, thecapital of Hubei province in China. Whereas at the beginning of the outbreak, cases were connectedto the Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan, efficient human-to-human transmission led toexponential growth in the number of cases, with the count standing at >71,000 as of today, with a~2.4% case-fatality rate. The RNA genome of 2019-nCoV features an identity of about 82% to thatof the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV); both viruses belong to clade b of the genus Betacoronavirus.Hence, it has been proposed to rename the new virus as SARS-CoV-2 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020).One of the best characterized drug targets among coronaviruses is the main protease (Mpro,also called 3CLpro). Along with the papain-like protease(s), this enzyme is essential for processingthe polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA (Hilgenfeld, 2014). The Mpro operates at noless than 11 cleavage sites on the large polyprotein 1ab (replicase 1ab, ~790 kDa); the recognitionsequence at most sites is Leu - Gln\u00af(Ser,Ala,Gly) (\u00af marks the cleavage site). Inhibiting the activityof this enzyme will block viral replication. Since no human proteases with a similar cleavagespecificity are known, chances are that inhibitors will exhibit low toxicity.Here we report the crystal structure of the Mpro of 2019-nCoV in the unliganded form andthe usage of this structure to design new a-ketoamide inhibitors, compounds 13a and 13b. Thesecompounds were developed on the basis of our first-generation peptidomimetic a-ketoamides,which we designed as broad-spectrum antivirals targeting the Mpros of beta-CoVs and alpha-CoVs,as well as the 3C protease of enteroviruses (Zhang et al., 2020). Compared to other inhibitors ofcysteine proteases, a-ketoamides have the advantage of bearing a relatively mild electrophilicwarhead that interacts with the catalytic center of the target enzyme through two hydrogen bondsrather than one, in addition to the covalent bond formed by nucleophilic attack of the catalyticcysteine onto the a-keto moiety.The 1.75-\u00c5 crystal structure of the unliganded 2019-nCoV Mpro (Fig. 1) reveals the highsimilarity to the SARS-CoV Mpro that was to be expected from sequence comparisons (Zhou et al.,2020; Wu et al., 2020). The r.m.s. deviation between the two free-enzyme structures is 0.53 \u00c5 for allCa positions of the molecule but the isolated domains exhibit r.m.s. deviations of only 0.31 \u00c5(domain II) - 0.42 \u00c5 (domains I, III) (comparison between the novel coronavirus Mpro structure andSARS-CoV Mpro, PDB entry 2BX4 (Tan et al., 2005)). The chymotrypsin- and picornavirus 3Cprotease-like domains I and II (residues 10-99 and 100-182, respectively) are six-strandedantiparallel b-barrels that harbor the substrate-binding site between them. Domain III (residues198303), a globular cluster of five helices, is involved in the regulation of dimer formation of the Mpro(Shi & Song, 2006). 2019-nCoV Mpro forms a tight dimer (contact interface, predominantly betweendomain II of molecule A and the NH2-terminal residues of molecule B (\"N-finger\"): ~1394 \u00c52),with the two molecules oriented perpendicular to one another (Fig. 1). Dimerization of the enzymeis necessary for catalytic activity, because the N-finger of each of the two protomers interacts withGlu166 of the other protomer and thereby helps shape the S1 pocket of the substrate-binding site(Anand et al., 2002). To reach this interaction site, the N-finger is squeezed in between domains IIand III of the parent monomer and domain II of the other monomer. Interestingly, in the SARS-CoVbut not in the 2019-nCoV Mprodimer, there is a polar interaction between the two domains IIIinvolving a 2.60-\u00c5 hydrogen bond between the side-chain hydroxyl groups of residue Thr285 of eachprotomer, and supported by a hydrophobic contact between the side-chain of Ile286 and Thr285 Cg2.In 2019-nCoV, the threonine is replaced by alanine (indicated by the black sphere in Fig. 1), and theisoleucine by leucine. It has previously been shown that replacing Ser284, Thr285, and Ile286 byalanine residues in SARS-CoV Mpro leads to a 3.6-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity of theprotease, concomitant with a slightly closer packing of the two domains III of the dimer against oneanother (Lim et al., 2014). According to that study, this is accompanied by changes of the structuraldynamics of the enzyme that transmit the effect of the mutation to the catalytic center. Indeed, theThr285Ala replacement observed in the 2019-nCoV Mpro also allows the two domains III to approacheach other a little closer (the distance between the Ca atoms of residues 285 in molecules A and Bis 6.77 \u00c5 in SARS-CoV Mpro and 5.21 \u00c5 in 2019-nCoV Mpro and the distance between the centers ofmass of the two domains III shrinks from 33.4 \u00c5 to 32.1 \u00c5).the dimer is shown in light blue, the other one in orange. Amino-acid residues of the catalytic siteare indicated as yellow and blue spheres, for Cys145 and His41, respectively. Black spheres indicatethe positions of Ala285 of each of the two domains III (see text). Chain termini are labeled N and Cfor molecule A (light blue) and N* and C* for molecule B (orange).In the active site of 2019-nCoV Mpro, Cys145 and His41 form a catalytic dyad. Like inSARSCoV Mpro and other coronavirus homologues, a buried water molecule is found hydrogen-bonded toPreviously, we have designed and synthesized peptidomimetic a-ketoamides asbroadspectrum inhibitors of the main proteases of betacoronaviruses and alphacoronaviruses as well asthe 3C proteases of enteroviruses (Zhang et al., 2020). The best of these compounds (11r; seeScheme 1) showed an EC50 of 400 picomolar against MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells as well as lowmicromolar EC50 values against SARS-CoV and a whole range of enteroviruses in various cell lines.In order to improve the half-life and the solubility of the compounds in human plasma, and toreduce the binding to plasma proteins, we have modified the compound by hiding the P3 - P2 amidebond within a pyridone ring and by replacing the cinnamoyl group. For a compound related to 11rbut modified this way (compound 13a), the half-life in human plasma was increased by 50%,solubility was improved, and plasma protein binding was reduced from 99% to 94%. There was nosign of toxicity in mice. In addition, 13a showed good metabolic stability using mouse and humanmicrosomes, with intrinsic clearance rates Clint_mouse= 32.00 \u00b5L/min/mg protein and Clint_human= 20.97\u00b5L/min/mg protein. This means that after 30 min, around 80% for mouse and 60% for humans,respectively, of residual compound remained metabolically stable. Pharmacokinetic studies in CD-1mice using the subcutaneous route at 20 mg/kg showed that 13a stayed in plasma for up to only4 hrs, but was excreted via urine up to 24 hrs. The Cmax was determined at 334.50 ng/mL and themean residence time was about 1.59 hrs. Although 13a seemed to be cleared very rapidly fromplasma, it was found at 24 hrs at 135 ng/g tissue in the lung and at 52.7 ng/mL in broncheo-alveolarlavage fluid (BALF) suggesting that it was mainly distributed to tissue. In the light of the currentCoV outbreak, it is advisable to develop compounds with lung tropism such as 13a. However,compared to 11r, the structural modification led to some loss of inhibitory activity against the mainprotease of 2019-nCoV (IC50 = 2.39 \u00b1 0.63 uM) as well as the 3C proteases of enteroviruses. Toenhance the antiviral activity against betacoronaviruses of clade b (2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV),we sacrificed the goal of broad-spectrum activity including the enteroviruses for the time being andreplaced the P2 cyclohexyl moiety of 13a by cyclopropyl in 13b, because the S2 pocket of thebetacoronavirus main proteases shows a pronounced plasticity enabling it to adapt to the shape ofsmaller inhibitor moieties entering this site (Zhang et al., 2020). Here we present X-ray crystalstructures in two different crystal forms, at 1.95 and 2.20 \u00c5 resolution, of the complex betweenaketoamide 13b optimized this way and the Mpro of 2019-nCoV (Fig. 2). One structure is in spacegroup C2, where both protomers of the Mpro dimer are bound by crystal symmetry to have identicalconformations, the other is in space group P212121, where the two protomers are independent ofeach other and free to adopt different conformations. Indeed, we find that in the latter crystalstructure, the key residue Glu166 adopts an inactive conformation (as evidenced by its prolongeddistance from His172 and the lack of H-bonding interaction between Glu166 and the P1 moiety of theinhibitor (see below)), even though compound 13b is bound in the same mode as in molecule A.This phenomenon has also been observed, in a more pronounced form, with the SARS-CoV Mpro(Yang et al., 2003) and is consistent with the half-site activity described for this enzyme (Chen et al.,2006). In all copies of the inhibited 2019-nCoV Mpro, the inhibitor binds to the shallowsubstratebinding site at the surface of each protomer, between domains I and II (Fig. 2).Mpro, in the monoclinic crystal form (space group C2). 2Fo-Fc electron density is shown for theinhibitor (contouring level: 1s). Carbon atoms of the inhibitor are magenta, oxygens red, nitrogensblue, and sulfur yellow. Note the interaction between the N-terminal residue of chain B, S1*, andThrough the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic Cys145 onto the a-keto group of the inhibitor,a thiohemiketal is formed in a reversible reaction. This is clearly reflected in the electron density(Fig. 2); the stereochemistry of this chiral moiety is S in all three copies of compound 13b in thesestructures. The oxyanion (or hydroxyl) group of this thiohemiketal is stabilized by a hydrogen bondfrom His41, whereas the amide oxygen of 13b accepts a hydrogen bond from the main-chain amidesof Gly143, Cys145, and partly Ser144, which form the canonical \"oxyanion hole\" of the cysteineprotease. The P1 g-lactam moiety, designed as a glutamine surrogate (Dragovich et al., 1999; Tan etal., 2013), is deeply embedded in the S1 pocket of the protease, where the lactam amide nitrogendonates a three-center (bifurcated) hydrogen bond to themain-chain oxygen of Phe140(3.20/3.10/3.28 \u00c5; values for the structure in space group C2/space group P212121 molecule A/spacegroup P212121 molecule B) and to the Glu166 carboxylate (3.35/3.33/ - \u00c5), and the carbonyl oxygenaccepts a 2.57/2.51/2.81-\u00c5 H-bond from the imidazole of His163. The P2 cyclopropyl methyl moietyis embraced by the S2 subsite, which has shrunk by 28.4 \u00c53 compared to a complex betweencompound 13a with P2 = cyclohexyl methyl and the SARS-CoV Mpro (LLZ et al., unpublished).The pyridone in the P3 position of the inhibitor occupies the space normally filled by the substrate'smain chain, its carbonyl oxygen accepts a 2.89/2.99/3.00-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the main-chainamide of residue Glu166. Further, the P3 amide donates a 2.83/2.96/2.87-\u00c5 H-bond to themainchain oxygen of Glu166. Embedded within the pyridone, the P2 nitrogen can no longer donate ahydrogen bond to the protein; however, our previous crystal structures showed that the P2mainchain amide of the linear a-ketoamides does not make a hydrogen bond with the protein in all cases,so this interaction does not seem to be essential (Zhang et al., 2020). The Boc group does notoccupy the canonical S4 site of the protease, but is located near Pro168 (at a distance of3.81/4.17/3.65 \u00c5); due to this interaction, the latter residue is \"pushed\" by >2 \u00c5 (compared to thestructure of the free enzyme). This contact explains that removing the Boc group weakens theinhibitory potency of this compound by a factor of about 2. Interestingly, there is a space betweenthe pyridone ring of 13b, the main chain of residue Thr190, and the side-chain of Gln189, which isfilled by a DMSO molecule in the C2 crystal structure and a water molecule in the P212121 structure.This suggests that P3 moieties more bulky than pyridone may be accepted here.Compound 13b inhibits the purified recombinant 2019-nCoV Mpro with IC50 = 0.67 \u00b1 0.18\u00b5M. The corresponding IC50 values for inhibition of the SARS-CoV Mpro and the MERS-CoV Mproare 0.9 \u00b1 0.29 \u00b5M and 0.58 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b5M, respectively. In a SARS-CoV replicon (Kusov et al., 2015),RNA replication is inhibited with EC50 = 1.75 \u00b1 0.25 \u00b5M. In human Calu3 cells infected withMERS-CoV, the compound showed excellent antiviral activity (Lucie Sauerhering & StephanBecker personal communication).As the next steps in the development of compound 13b towards a potential drug targeting2019-nCoV or other coronaviruses, we will undertake tests in virus-infected cell cultures and in asmall-animal model (once it will become available for 2019-nCoV). Meanwhile, our crystalstructures may be used by others for virtual screening and de-novo design of inhibitors.Anand K., Palm G. J., Mesters J. R., Siddell S.
