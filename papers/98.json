Themain protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be anattractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 smallmolecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease byhigh-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugshave been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which mayserve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.Keywords: 2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV; main protease; therapeutic drugs.        Since December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged inWuhan, China. Genome sequencing of samples from these patients confirmed that theculprit of these infections was a beta-coronavirus that has never been reported before,which was later named as 2019-nCoV [                The discovery and clinical application of specific drugs against 2019-nCoV is aneffective means to alleviate the current epidemic. However, there are no clinicallyeffective drugs for this virus for the moment. Although 2019-nCoV is significantlydifferent from SARS-CoV, which breakout in Beijing 17 years before [        In order to screening the possible drug candidates that were able to prevent orcure the infection, high-throughput screening was performed based on the 8,000clinical drug libraries using the online software Vina and SeeSAR, combined with ourin-house automatic processing scripts and screening programs, and 4 small moleculardrugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease were identified.These drugs were widely used in clinical practice, so the safety was guaranteed. Inview of the activity and safety of these wildly used drugs, it is feasible to conductclinical exploratory treatment in special cases such as the outbreak of 2019-nCoV.Here we report the identify and structure of these molecules.        The CDS and proteins of Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus (Accession:NC_045512.2) were obtained from NBCI database. The structures and sequences ofSARS-CoV main protease were downloaded from PDB database. Nearly 8000molecules were obtained from Drugbank [        Molecular similarity search was performed by using a strategy based on thesimilar sequences ofthe structure-revealed molecules. The NCBI-blast v2.9 wasinstalled in local machine, then a local database was established by the molecularsequences of SARS-CoV main protease from PDB. The blastp was ran by defaultparameter.        The AutoDock vina was obtained from website of scripps.edu [        The candidates harvested from docking were deeply analyzed for atom-basedaffinity contributions and physical-chemical properties by SeeSAR (version 9.2;BioSolveIT GmbH, Sankt Augustin, Germany, 2019, www.biosolveit.de/SeeSAR).        The 3D molecule images were displayed by PyMOL v2.3 [        The affinities of Vina less than -7.7 kcal/mol were harvested initially. Then thosemolecules were removed such as toxin, experimental and unapproved ones, and thosewith strong side effects. Finally, the candidate drugs were selected with betteraffinities in Vina and SeeSAR.We downloaded the sequences of a total of 103 SARS-CoV main proteaseswithdifferent origins from PDB and built a local library for homology alignment. Theresult revealed that the similarity between the region at 3264 ~ 3570 aa of 2019-nCoVORF1 ab protein and SARS-CoV main protease 5n5o was up to 96.1% (Fig. 1). Thus,the main protease is highly conserved and main protease 5n5ocan be used as ahomologous target for screening of possible drugs against 2019-nCoV.There were three binding pockets detected in the viral main protease bycomputation, as labeled in Fig.2C. In comparison to the dimer and monomer structureof the protein (Fig.2A and B), we could figure out that the pocket 1 was the bindingsite with natural substrate, pocket 2 was the joint groove between two monomers, anda small pocket 3 was located in the C terminal.At first, we harvested 690 molecules with possible binding capacity withSARS-CoV main protease, but most of them were dyes, toxins and antitumor drugswith strong side effects, about 50 molecules were left after excluding these moleculesand other neurologic drugs, and then we selected marketable drugs from them forfurther kinetic and bio-chemical analysis. Finally, 4 molecules were identified,including No. 6651 molecule (Prulifloxacin), No. 6589 molecule (Bictegravir), No.0097molecule (Nelfinavir) and No. 6626 molecule (Tegobuvi).The binding energies of No. 6651 molecule (Prulifloxacin, Fig. 3A) to viral mainprotease were -8.2 Kcal/mol, -8.2 Kcal/mol, -7.9 kcal/mol at three binding sites,respectively (Fig. 3B), which were the cave adjacent to the N-terminal, the dimer jointgroove and its back side. Moreover, at several docking poses, all of the estimatedaffinitiesof binding were between \u03bcM to mM. The evaluations of ligand-lipophilicityefficiency (LLE), torsion and clash were also satisfied.The binding sites between bictegravir and the main protease was displayed at Fig.4B, the binding energy between Bictegravirand major protease was -8.3 kcal/mol atthe joint groove, but only -7.3 kcal/mol at the active site, and the estimated affinity issatisfied (Fig. 4C).The results showed that the binding site between Nelfinavir and the main proteasewas located at the joint groove (Fig. 5B). The binding energy between Nelfinavir andmajor protease was -8.6 kcal/mol, but the estimated affinity seemed not high enough(Fig. 5C).Tegobuvir was docked into the joint groove of main protein, the binding energybetween them was -8.9 kcal/mol, and the estimated affinity is satisfied (Fig. 6C). Thebinding sites was displayed at Fig. 6B.        Although coronaviruses are under extensive mutagenesis, some key proteins,especially replication-related enzymes, are highly conserved [        In the current study, based on the results from bioinformatics analysis, thestructure of SARS-CoV 5n5o protein was selected as a homologous target formolecule screening. Then, in silico high throughput screening strategy and automaticpipeline have been established by using classic docking software and our in-houseprogram, which greatly accelerates the screening process.Among the four        molecules identified in this study, prulifloxacin is achemotherapeutic fluoroquinolone antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity, it has beenapproved for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections,community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Italy and gastroenteritis, includinginfectious diarrheas, in Japan [        Our results clearly showed that all the four molecules showed reasonable bindingconformations with the viralmain protease. Among them, Prulifloxacin exhibited threebinding sites with main protease, two of which were the same as Nelfinavir andBictegravir. Further, molecule Prulifloxacin and Bictegravir are preferable toNelfinaviras confirmed by affinity and physical-chemical properties analysis usingSeeSAR. Based on the pockets\u2019 functions of target protein, it suggested that thesemolecules should possess the abilities to block the active sites or interrupt the dimerformation of viral protein. Therefore, they may sever as promising candidates for drugrepurpose and development against 2019-nCoV.mainFig. 2.Pockets and functional sites of viral protease.
