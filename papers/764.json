We found that the number of MHC class I and class II binders,weighted by the HLA allele frequency in the Chinese population, are not spatially uniform acrossthe viral genome. And there are a small number of genomic regions that showed high peaks ofimmunogenicity corresponding to a large number of MHC binders in a small neighborhood,which could be better potential vaccine targets (Sup. Table 1). The MHC binding peptideprofiles of a different racial population (i.e. European ancestry) are shown in Sup. Fig. 1.Interestingly, the T cell epitope intensities (number of binders weighted by allele frequency) arehigher overall in the European population than the Chinese population, suggesting that theChinese population                We also examined the potentials of the viral proteins to encode linear epitopes that can elicitantibody responses, by using the BepiPred 1.0 software (14). For the current analyses, wefocused on linear epitopes, rather than conformational epitopes, because linear epitopes are moresuitable for vaccine design (15, 16). Similarly s                For comparison, we also computed the immune vulnerability maps of SARS (Fig. 1e) and MERS(Fig. 1f), which are the two most aggressive                Coronaviruses are all RNA virus (18), and RNA viruses generally have very high mutation rates(19).

The selection of good vaccination epitopes should focus on parts of viral proteins withgood potentials of generating immunogenic epitopes, and with less chance of mutations.

The reference genomeannotation was acquired from NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947. Thecomplete genome SARS and MERS sequences are also downloaded from NCBI:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=txid694009%5BOrganism%3Anoexp%5D+and+complete+genome andhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=txid1335626%5BOrganism%3Anoexp%5D+and+complete+genomeNetMHCpan (v4.0) (20) and NetMHCIIpan (v3.2) (13) with default threshold options were usedto predict peptides, from the viral proteins, that bind to human MHC class I and II proteins for allthe available HLA alleles. Only strong binders (<0.5% percentile rank) were retained. The HLAallele population frequency for the Chinese population was acquired from Kwok et al (21) andpopulation frequency for the European population was from Mack et al (22). The B cell epitopepredictions were made by the BepiPred 1.0 software (14) with default parameters. Amino acidswith B cell epitope prediction scores >0.6 are regarded as having good likelihood of generatinglinear antibodies.The command-line version of MUSCLE (v3.8.31) (23, 24) was used to perform multiple genomesequence alignment with diagonal optimization (-diags). The default number of iteration and thedefault maximum number of new trees were applied during the alignment. The protein sequencealignment between the S proteins, YP_009724390.1 (2019-nCoV) and NP_828851.1 (SARS),was performed using EMBOSS needle (25) with the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix.        The Immune Viewer is a dynamic website. It is developed using the HTML (HyperText MarkupLanguage), JavaScript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Specifically, we used the D3.js libraryto allow users to interactively explore the mutation rates or immunogenic scores across the viralgenomic regions. We also used the D3.phylogram.js to visualize the phylogenetic tree and theSelect2 library to facilitate use        All computations and statistical analyses were carried out in the R computing environment. Forall boxplots appearing in this study, box boundaries represent interquartile ranges, whiskersextend to the most extreme data point which is no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range,and the line in the middle of the box represents the median. For the line plots, the viral genomeswere binned by every 60 nucleotide, and the number of T cell and B cell epitopes falling intoeach window is calculated. For T cell epitopes, a sum of the number of epitopes weighted by thecorresponding ethnic population\u2019s HLA allele (A, B, C, and DRB1) frequency is calculated toform the T cell and B cell immunogenicity strength for that population. The genetic variation rateat each nucleotide is calculated by examining all viral strains and counting the proportion ofstrains with a different nucleotide or with an insertion/deletion, with respect to the referencegenome. The genetic variation rates are also binned by the same length of windows andaveraged.
