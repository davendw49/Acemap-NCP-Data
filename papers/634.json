Lover, Thomas McAndrew", "title": "Sentinel Event Surveillance to Estimate Total SARS-CoV-2 Infections, United States", "type": "preprint article", "abstract": "Human infections with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were first identified via syndromic surveillance in December of 2019 in Wuhan China. Since identification, infections (coronavirus disease-2019; COVID-19) caused by this novel pathogen have spread globally, with more than 180,000 confirmed cases as of March 16, 2020. Effective public health interventions, including social distancing, contact tracing, and isolation/quarantine rely on the rapid and accurate identification of confirmed cases. However, testing capacity (having sufficient tests and laboratory throughput) to support these non-pharmaceutical interventions remains a challenge for containment and mitigation of COVID-19 infections. We undertook a sentinel event strategy (where single health events signal emerging trends) to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 in the US. Data from a recent national conference, the Conservative Political Action Conference, (CPAC) near Washington, DC and from the outbreak in Wuhan, China were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total number of incident SARSCoV-2 infections in the United States on March 1, 2020, and to forecast subsequent infections potentially undetected by current testing strategies. Our analysis and forecasting estimates a total of 54,100 SARS-CoV-2 infections (80 % CI 5,600 to 125,300) have occurred in the United States to March 12, 2020. Our forecast predicts that a very substantial number of infections are undetected, and without extensive and far-reaching non-pharmaceutical interventions, the number of infections should be expected to grow at an exponential rate.", "text": "To date, testing for COVID-19 cases (clinical and otherwise) has been limited in the US. Hospitals and healthcarefacilities that do have tests have limited the testing criteria to those with highest potential risk, to optimize the use ofscarce resources [1]. Where widespread testing has occurred, increased prevalences in high-risk groups have been found[2, 3].Evidence-based public health programming depends on data-driven estimates of disease burden to develop interventions.As such, accurate estimate of the underlying burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the US can provide criticalinformation for hospital administrators, county- and state-level Departments of Health, and the US Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) to optimize and prioritize resource allocation.https://www.umass.edu/sphhs/person/faculty/andrew-loveryhttp://www.thomasmcandrew.com/The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), that took place Feb. 26-29, 2020 outside Washington DCis a large annual event that draws approximately 20,000 participants from across the entire US, thus serving as arepresentative national sample. A single person was reported as \u2019presumptive positive\u2019 for COVID-19 on Mar 7, 2020,and exposure was reported to be prior to the CPAC event [4].The point incidence of COVID-19 in this defined cohort was used to estimate the national incidence during this period,and subsequent forecasting of current SARS-CoV-2 infections across the entire US. The number of attendees andnumber of confirmed cases were used to fit a simple exponential growth model to estimate the total COVID-19 infectionsper day throughout the United States up to March 15th, 2020.2This analysis proceeded in three stages. Firstly, the point incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated for theCPAC cohort. Secondly, With an assumption that this group was a near-random sample of Americans, this proportion(daily incidence rate) was then extrapolated to the entire US population (329 million persons) to provide an estimatednational daily incidence on March 1, 2020. Finally, this estimate with appropriate error structures, was projectedforward in time using epidemiological parameters from the epidemic in Wuhan, PRC to forecast cumulative infectionson March 12, 2020.Data for this analysis were complied from routine sources; press reports from CPAC; and parameters estimated frommodeling studies for the early (exponential growth phase) of the epidemic in China. The number of attendees and thenumber of confirmed COVID-19 cases at CPAC was collected from press reporting. The epidemic doubling time wastaken from previous work which estimated from data on the outbreak in Wuhan, China. This doubling time from theWuhan data was estimated to be 6.4 days, (95 CrI 5.8\u20137.1), and we used a lognormal distribution for D followingliterature values for other doubling times [5, 6].3Projecting this total infection burden forward (Fig. 1) using doubling time parameters from Wuhan gives a nationalcumulative incidence estimate of 54,145 infections (80 % CI 5,647 to 125,274) across the United States up until March12, 2020. This total includes all infections- asymptomatic, subclinical and clinical cases.200,0002Vo y-C lla150,000S nR ioA tS al nta ,s 100,000o nt iod te ct feam in 50,000itsE0point estimates80% CIPerkins et al., 202095% PPIr 2aMr 4aMr 6aMr 8aMr 10aMr 12aMr 14aMr 16aMCPAC conference Feb. 27-29, 2020.This forecasted cumulative number of infections is consistent with those of Perkins et al., from independent data sourcesand with entirely different modeling frameworks, and greatly strengthens the validity of both sets of estimates [7]. Thelarge number of predicted infections compared against the currently reported total confirmed COVID-19 cases in theUnited States suggest an important proportion of infections may be currently undetected, while entering a phase ofpotentially very rapid growth of the epidemic.4This analysis is not without limitations. Our forecasts are based on parameter estimates using best-available dataat the time of analysis to inform public health policy (coined \u201coutbreak science\u201d [8]). Demographic data for CPACattendees was not available, so we are unable to assess how representative this sentinel event may be for the entire USpopulation. This analysis also relies on simplistic models that assumes a well-mixed population, and uses data derivedfrom transmission scenarios that may not represent transmission within the US. The upper limit of total infectionsshould be interpreted with caution, as small uncertainties early in the projections also accumulate exponentially. Finally,this analysis does not account for spatial heterogeneity and diverse population mixing patterns throughout the UnitedStates, which are a critical driver of observed transmission.55.1The modelWe assumed that cumulative infections up to day t, denoted by It, followed an exponential growth model:where I0 is the number of initial infections, t is the time, in days, since March 1, 2020, and D is the doubling time (indays). Estimates of I0 and D are needed to forecast the cumulative number of infections at time t.5.2Estimating I0We estimated total incidence among the US population on March 1st, denoted by I0, as follows,It = I0 2t=D;(1)I0 = PI(CPAC)0P (CPAC) ;where P denotes the size of the US population (329M, [9]), I0(CPAC) the incidence among CPAC attendees and P (CPAC)the number of CPAC attendees. The parameter I0 represents the assumed fraction of the US population that is infectedwith COVID19. The incidence estimated from CPAC was extrapolated to the US population based on the assumption ofequal incidence in CPAC attendees and the US population.The initial relative incidence I0(s)=P was assumed to follow a beta distributionI(s)0(s)= P(s);BI(CPAC) + I0(CPAC); P (CPAC)0I(CPAC) + 10I(CPAC) !0P (CPAC):with a prior over , the probability of infection, equal to a BI(CP AC); 10I(CPAC)P0(CPAC) . The prior is generated byhaving observed one sample from the general population with incidence \u201cas observed in the CPAC population\u201d5.3Estimating DThe doubling time of the disease was taken from previous work using data on the outbreak in Wuhan, China, and wasestimated to be 6.4 days, (95 CrI 5.8\u20137.1) and lognormally distributed [5, 6]log D(s)N log(6:4); (1:3=4)2 :Model-based projectionsPoint estimates for projected incidence were obtained directly using Eq. 1 and the point estimates of doubling time andinitial incidence. Uncertainty in the number of infections was obtained by taking 30; 000 Monte Carlo samples of I0and D according to their probability densities, and constructing a probability mass function for trajectories, It,p(It = I)N 1 X 1I I0i 2t=Dj :i;jSpecifically, the 80% projection interval for It is given by the 10th and 90th percentiles of samples fIt(s); It(2); : : : ; It(S)g.Analysis was performed using R [10] for a 16-day window after March 1, in 1-day intervals. Standard 95% and 80%confidence intervals were constructed across the forecast period.6The authors are grateful for feedback and insightful suggestions from Nick Reich and Leontine Alkema(UMassAmherst).[2] US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
