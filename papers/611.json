Master student in Public Health and Epidemiology at the Pasteur-CNAM School in Paris. pneumonia named COVID-19 has started from Wuhan (China) has led to 254 996 confirmed cases until midday March 20, 2020. Sporadic cases have been imported worldwide, in Algeria, the first case reported on February 25, 2020 was imported from Italy, and then the epidemic has spread to other parts of the country very quickly with 90 confirmed cases until March 19, 2020. Methods: It is crucial to estimate the cases number growth in the early stages of the outbreak, to this end, we have implemented the Alg-COVID-19 Model which allows to predict the incidence and the reproduction number R0 in the coming months in order to help decision makers. The Alg-COVIS-19 Model initial equation (1) estimates the incidence (cases number) at (t) prediction time using two parameters: the reproduction number (R0) and the serial interval (SI) Results: We found R0=2.56 (95% CI 2.16-2.98) based on actual incidence at the first 23 days, using the serial interval SI= 4,4 and the prediction time t=23. The herd immunity HI estimated is HI=61%. Also, The Covid-19 incidence predicted with the Alg-COVID-19 Model fits closely the actual incidence during the first 23 days of the epidemic in Algeria (Fig. 1.A) which allows us to use it. According to Alg-COVID-19 Model, the number of cases will exceed 5000 on the 40th day (April 5th) and it will double to 10000 on 43th day of the epidemic (April 8th), thus, exponential phase will begin (Table 2; Fig.1.B) and increases continuously until reaching \u00e0 herd immunity of 61% unless serious preventive measures are considered. Discussion: This model is valid only when the majority of the population is vulnerable to", "text": "reported four cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology (unknown cause), the next day, thefound to have a link with Huanan seafood and animal market in Wuhan, the Centers for Disease(2019-nCoV) and its gene sequence was quickly submitted (GenBank 2019), the coronaviruswas renamed COVID-19 by WHO on February 12, 2020. It has since been identified as azoonotic coronavirus, similar to SARS and MERS coronaviruses.

In Algeria, the first case of COVID-19 was reported oncountry, a few days later, on March 1, 2020, two cases were reported in Blida region in thefor holidays, they were detected positive after their return to France, since then, a COVID-19outbreak has started in this region (Blida) that form a cluster of more than 5,4 million inhabitantswith the surrounding cities (Algiers, Boumerdes, Tipaza) (Algerian Ministry of Health 2020,        2020, the Algerian authorities have declared 93 confirmed cases with a fatality rate of 9.6% (9deaths) (Table 1)        the COVOD-19 reproduction number (R0) has been estimated in various studies, they found,        range from 1.5 to 6.49 with an average of 4.2.

Itcan be also understood as the average number of infections caused by a typical individual duringthe early stage of an outbreak when nearly all individuals in the population are susceptible toinfection. The basic reproduction number reflects the ability of an infection spreading under nocontrol, it has three components        The approach implemented to estimate the basic reproduction numbers (R0) in this model is tocalculate the average R0 using the real chronological incidence (case number) during the first23 days of the COVID-19 Algeria epidemic between February 25 and March 19, 2020, so that,we used the equation (3) derived from the equation (1). The R0 will be used also to calculatethe herd immunity (HI) needed to stop the epidemic spontaneously based on the equation 4.R0 = [\u2211HI = (1 \u2212(1] \u00f7 23 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 (3)) \u2217 100 .\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(4)predicted COVID-19 incidence at any time of the epidemic using Alg-COVID-19 Model(equation 1), based on three parameters, namely, the average reproduction number based on theactual incidence at the first 23 days R0=2.5685 (95% CI 2.16\u20132.98) (equation 3), the serialinterval (SI=4.4) and the prediction time (t) we are looking for. The herd immunity (HI)estimated using the (equation 4) is HI=61%.The estimations presented by this Model are based on the first 23 days data and cover the nextmonths of COVID-19 epidemic in Algeria, according to that, the number of cases will exceed5000 on the 40th day (April 5th) and it will double to 10000 on 43th day of the epidemic (Aprilreaching \u00e0 herd immunity of 61% or a serious preventive measures are considered.Time (days)Alg-COVID-19 modelActual casesAB500450400350300250re            Time (days)al. 2020), also, it is in the range of reproduction numbers of other studies mentioned below(Shen, et al. 202            infection, since it does not take into account the herd immunity acquired ongoing epidemic.contact rate, this will obviously reduce the R0 and the reproduction number after preventivemeasures (R1) can be calculated to estimate the implemented preventive actions effectiveness,and Alg-COVID-19 Model can be updated to fit the new R1 values.announced, consequently, the response to the epidemic will change from trying to curb thespread of viruses on the territory to a strategy that lead to mitigate the effects of the epidemicwave, so that, after R0 and SI update, the model can be used to predict the hospitalization andAlgerian Ministry of Health. 2020. http://covid19.sante.gov.dz/carte/.CDC. 2020. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019.html.Chong, You, et al. \u201cEstimation of the Time-Varying Reproduction Number of COVID-19 Outbreak inChina.\u201d medRxiv, 2020.Cooper, BS., RJ.
