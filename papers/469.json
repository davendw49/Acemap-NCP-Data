Therefore, few onlinemental health services were providedfor those in need.4 The popularisationof internet services and smartphones,and the emergence of fifth generation(5G) mobile networks, have enabledmental health professionals andhealth authorities to provide onlinemental health services during theCOVID-19 outbreak. Fast transmissionof the virus between people hinderstraditional face-to-face psychologicalinterventions. By contrast, provisionof online mental health services issafe. To date, several types of onlinemental health services have beenimplemented widely for those in needduring the outbreak in China.Firstly, as of Feb 8, 2020, 72 onlinemental health surveys associatedwith the COVID-19 outbreak could besearched for via the WeChat-basedsurvey programme Questionnaire Star,which target different populations,including medical staff (23 of thesurveys), patients with COVID-19(one survey), students (18 surveys),the general population (nine surveys),and mixed populations (21 surveys);in Hubei province (five surveys), otherprovinces (15 surveys), all provinces,municipalities, and autonomousregions (36 surveys), and unspecifiedareas of China (16 surveys). Onesuch multicentre survey involving1563 medical staf, with our centre atNanfang Hospital, Southern MedicalUniversity (Guangzhou, China) asone of the study sites, found theprevalence of depression (defined as atotal score of \u22655 in the Patient HealthQuestionnaire-9) to be 50\u00b77%, ofanxiety (defined as a total score of \u22655in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7)to be 44\u00b77%, of insomnia to be 36\u00b71%(defined as a total score of \u22658 in theInsomnia Severity Index), and ofstressrelated symptoms (defined as a totalscore of \u22659 in the Impact of EventsScale-Revised) to be 73\u00b74%. Thesefindings are important in enablinghealth authorities to allocate healthresources and develop appropriatetreatments for medical staf who havemental health problems.Secondly, online mental healtheducation with communicationprogrammes, such as WeChat, Weibo,and TikTok, has been widely usedduring the outbreak for medical stafand the public. In addition, severalbooks on COVID-19 prevention,control, and mental health educationhave been swiftly published and freeelectronic copies have been providedfor the public. As of February 8,29 books associated with COVID-19have been published, 11 (37\u00b79%)of which are on mental health,including the \u201cGuidelines for publicpsychological self-help and counsellingof 2019-nCoV pneumonia\u201d, publishedby the Chinese Association for MentalHealth.Finally, online psychologicalcounselling services (eg, WeChat-basedresources) have been widely establishedby mental health professionals inmedical institutions, universities,and academic societies throughoutall 31 provinces, municipalities, andautonomous regions in mainlandChina, which provide free 24-hservices on all days of the week. Onlinepsychological self-help interventionsystems, including online cognitivebehavioural therapy for depression,anxiety, and insomnia (eg, on WeChat),have also been developed. In addition,several artificial intelligence (AI)programmes have been put in use asinterventions for psychological crisesduring the epidemic. For example,individuals at risk of suicide can berecognised by the AI programme TreeHoles Rescue,5 by monitoring andanalysing messages posted on Weibo,and alerting designated volunteers toact accordingly.I n g e n e r a l , o n l i n e m e n t a lhealth services being used for theCOVID-19 epidemic are facilitatingthe development of Chinese publicemergency interventions, andeventually could improve the qualityand effectiveness of emergencyinterventions.We declare no competing interests.", "ref_list": [[], ["The mental health of medical workers in Wuhan, China dealing with the 2019 novel coronavirus"], [""], ["Guidelines for psychological assistance hotlines during 2019-nCoV pneumonia epidemic"], [""], [""], ["The Chinese suicides prevented by AI from afar"], [""], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "ref_authors": [[], ["L Kang", "Y Li", "S Hu"], [], [], [], [], ["Wang Y."], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []], "fir_para": "At the start of 2020, the 2019\ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19),\noriginating from Wuhan in Hubei\nprovince, started to spread throughout\nChina.
