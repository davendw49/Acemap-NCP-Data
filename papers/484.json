Morerecently, outbreaks of the severe acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus, in2002, and the Middle East respiratorysyndrome coronavirus, in 2012, havebeen characterised byhuman-tohuman transmission and highincidence of acute respiratory failure. Thegrowing alarm for the novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) spreading from Chinabrings back the spectre of the rapidlydiufsing pandemics of the past. 2Non-invasive ventilation is anefective and common treatment forpatients with mild to moderate acuterespiratory failure.3 It is associated withmortality reduction compared to eitherspontaneous breathing or mechanicalventilation by endotracheal tube assupported by several randomised trials.4Emergency departments and intensivecare units are increasingly applyingnon-invasive ventilation.3 When usedto treat acute respiratory failure,noninvasive ventilation is applied to thepatient mainly by face mask or helmet.3Since coronavirus diffusion takesplace by droplet transmission,2aerosolisation during hospital procedureslike intubation or bronchoscopy mightrepresent a big concern, exposingother patients and health-care staf toan increased risk of infection, as duringthe flu pandemia.1 Aerosolisationwith nosocomial amplification of theinfection can also potentially happenaround the face mask duringnoninvasive ventilation, as demonstratedin different simulation studies.5Accordingly, the eficacy and safety ofnon-invasive ventilation during viralpandemic infection are still debated.However, during pandemics, thenumber of intensive care unit bedsfor mechanical ventilation throughtracheal intubation could rapidlybecome insufficient,1 whereasnoninvasive ventilation can be oefred alsooutside the intensive care unit.4To increase safety duringnon-invasive ventilation, use of a helmet as anon-invasive ventilation interface canbe considered to avoid aerosolisationwhen the helmet is connected tothe ventilator without air dispersionthrough a spring-valve; unfortunately,a helmet costs more than most facemasks. Accordingly, when facing apatient with acute respiratory failureof suspected viral nature (and, aboveall, during pandemics), we recommendthe adoption of helmets and avoidanceof face masks as the non-invasiveventilation interface. Moreover, wesuggest that manufacturers shoulddevelop cheap and safe non-invasiveventilation interfaces to be used duringviral pandemics.We declare no competing interests.2019-nCoV, fake news,and racismPublished OnlineThe novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) February 11, 2020outbreak has had a significant Sh0tt1p4s0:/-/6d7o3i.6or(g2/01)03.01305176-/3impact on global health.
