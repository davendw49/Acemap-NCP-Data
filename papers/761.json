This cell line is being widelyused to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed usinga recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viraltranscripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication andtranscription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected insubgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identifiedin over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furincleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoproteininto functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein canbe a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Alliedto this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteinspredicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique tothe deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion inthe furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and otherregions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance giventhe interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation thatthe furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis ofthis virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growthof viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinicalsamples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity andmortality.Since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARSCoV-2) as a human pathogen at the end of 2019, the virus has spread globally,causing > 312 000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 13,400 deaths as of the 22ndMarch, 20201. Although vaccines are under rapid development to preventSARS-CoV2 infection, little is known of either the immune correlates of protection or the ability ofthe virus to avoid the host immune response through mutation and recombination2.The genome sequence was rapidly determined and revealed that SARS-CoV-2 ismost closely related to bat coronavirus RaTG13 and clusters with SARS-CoV, thatemerged in 2002, in the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae3,4. Basedon homology to other known coronaviruses3,4, the genome sequence was used forviral transcript prediction and the annotation of ORFs. Coronaviruses use a complexstrategy to express their genetic information5, and transcription is initiated from defined(and sometimes cryptic) transcription associated sequences6. Similar, to othercoronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 29.9 kB RNA genome contains two large ORFs,ORF1a and ORF1ab, predicted to be initially translated into the polyproteins, pp1a,and pp1ab that arises by ribosomal frameshifting (Figure 1A). The polyproteins arepost-translationally processed by viral encoded proteases to produce 16 proteins thatare conserved between coronaviruses and proposed to function in the synthesis ofviral RNA and immune evasion7. During viral genome replication a set of \u201cnested\u201dsubgenomic mRNAs are produced that are predicted to encode the structural proteinsspike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) and at least nine smallaccessory proteins, some of which are unique to SARS-CoV-23,4. The subgenomicmRNAs have a common 5\u2019 leader sequence and are 3\u2019 co-terminal with a polyA tail.This feature is likely to be added by viral encoded proteins in the cytoplasm of aninfected cell.Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome has been examined using direct RNAseq(dRNAseq)8,9. Furthermore, a recent proteomic study showed that a number of thepredicted viral proteins are produced in infected cells, but not all of the predicted viralproteins were detected10. We pioneered the use of combining transcriptomics andproteomics to study viral infections in vitro and in vivo, initially using the wellcharacterised respiratory virus, adenovirus but also respiratory syncytial virus andhighly pathogenic zoonotic viruses such as Hendra virus11-13. More recently we havefocussed on the latest technologies to study the transcriptome of viruses, includingdirect RNA sequencing on nanopore devices using long read length sequencing. Inparticular, we developed a novel ORF-centric pipeline to analyse the very largeamounts of transcriptomic data generated by this technique14. This pipeline was firstused on data generated from adenovirus infected cells. The approach rapidlyreproduced transcript maps that correlated highly with the previously describedtranscriptome maps of adenovirus which have been carefully curated over severaldecades.The SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs encoding the structural proteins and theirexpression profiles are of particular interest as the encoded proteins are likely targetsof a protective immune response. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is present as ahomotrimer, protruding from the surface of the virion. It is a key determinant of viraltropism and the major antigenic target15,16. The S glycoprotein is a class I fusionprotein comprised of two domains, S1 and S2, responsible for receptor binding andthe fusion of viral and cellular membranes respectively17,18. The coronavirus Sglycoprotein of coronaviruses is primed for cell entry by host cell proteases that cleavethe protein at one or more positions. Cleavage of a \u201cS1/S2\u201d site at the boundary of theS1 and S2 domains occurs for some coronaviruses whilst cleavage at a \u201cS2\u201d site iscommon to all coronaviruses and results in activation of a highly conserved fusionpeptide immediately downstream of the S2 site19-21. Although the SARS-CoV-2 Sglycoprotein shares 97% identity with that of bat coronavirus RaTG1322, an importantdifference is the presence of a four amino acid insertion (681PRRA684) at the S1/S2cleavage site that introduces a potential furin-like cleavage site23,24. The furin cleavagesite is also not found in other \u201clineage B\u201d betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, buthas been detected in betacoronaviruses in other lineages, suggesting that this regionhas arisen during natural evolution25.Here we used a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach to produce acorrelated transcriptome and proteome map of SARS-CoV-2 in the African Greenmonkey kidney cell line Vero E6. This cell line is routinely used globally to propagateviruses from clinical samples as well as to generate stocks of virus for academicresearch, drug susceptibility testing and vaccine challenge studies. There was a closecorrelation between predicted viral transcriptome and proteome maps as well as noveltranscripts that encoded for proteins detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Finally,evidence was gathered for an in-frame deletion inside the S glycoprotein that removedthe proposed furin cleavage site.Complete characterisation of a novel and dangerous pathogen at a molecular level ishighly desirable. Although analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome enables highconfidence prediction of potential transcripts and ORFS, there is a pressing need tohave the predictions confirmed and novel transcripts identified and assessed forbiological significance and role in virulence and pathogenesis. At the same time,independent confirmation that viral transcripts were expressed was achieved bytandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics. This provided direct observation of thewhole range of viral proteins and helped resolve ambiguities in the transcriptomic data.Finally, identification of phosphorylation sites provided an invaluable list of therapeutictargets based on kinase inhibitors. Using proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT)11 on duplicate infected cells offered a rapid and high resolution approach to these keymolecular virology questions.Long read length sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION on polyA+ RNA fromcells infected with SARS-CoV-2 was used to characterise viral RNA species. Thistechnique has recently been used to study herpes viruses, coronaviruses andadenovirus transcriptomes 14,26,27. In total, 1,588,330 sequences were base called andpassed QC, of those 527,401 were mapped to the BetaCoV/England/02/2020 genomeusing minimap2 (Figure 1b). In addition, an average polyA tail length for eachtranscript was generated using nanopolish and this information was added to theanalysis pipeline. A strict cut off of a 20 nt minimum polyA length was employed and386,903 transcripts passed this test. Accurately determining the 5\u2019 end of directRNAseq transcripts has been shown to be problematic 14,27,28. The accepted model forcoronavirus transcription (Figure 1a) proposes that all viral mRNAs have a common5\u2019 end 29 and the analysis herein was further restricted to those transcripts that metthis criterion which reduced the total number of identified full length subgenomicmRNA molecules to 72,124. Figure 1c illustrates a transcription map of thosetranscripts that start at the expected location and have a known ORF as the 5\u2019 mostORF. Transcripts that could express all of the predicted ORFs were present, includingfor the newly predicted ORF10 30. However, only one transcript was detected and aspreviously suggested 8,9 the status of this as a genuine transcript needs careful furtherinvestigation. Moreover, non-canonical TRS joining events were detected leading to,for example, apparently bone fide subgenomic transcripts coding for ORF7b. this wasalso recently reported by Kim et al. 8. The distribution of transcripts with a 5\u2019 UTRconsistent with the model of coronavirus mRNA expression that would also code for apredicted protein are shown in Table 1. Also reported are the average polyA taillengths of each transcript group. These appeared to be shorter than most humaneukaryotic transcripts but is consistent with recently reported findings forSARS-CoV2 8. Finally, the data from the analysis pipeline was tabulated and describes thestructure of transcripts, how often they were observed, what features were present oneach transcript and where the dominant transcription start sites and junctions are(Supplementary Tables 1- 4).Manual inspection of the transcripts aligned to the virus genome revealed a largenumber of reads that aligned to the gene encoding the S glycoprotein with a 24 ntdeletion. This was predicted to result in a deletion of 9 aa, encompassing the proposedfurin-like cleavage site (Figure 2a) with the replacement of a single isoleucine residue.Indeed the analysis revealed that there were a large number of transcripts that hadboth a polyA tail > 20 nt and a start at the proposed transcription start location, morethan the full length S-glycoprotein (Table 1). To confirm this finding and examine if thedeletion was present in the original stock samples at the PHE reference laboratory,the region was PCR amplified from the virus passaged at Bristol or from the originalstock. These amplified fragments were sequenced using the Sanger method. Thisrevealed that the Bristol stock was indeed a mixture of genomes but the original stockwas solely wild type sequence. Subsequent examination of a very high quality datasetreported recently by Kim et al. 8 did not detect any evidence of similar significantdeletions in the S glycoprotein in their data. However, their dataset contained aspontaneous deletion within the region of the genome coding for the E protein resultingin a 9aa in-frame deletion in almost two thirds of the mapped transcripts(Supplementary Figure 1).Tandem mass spectrometry was utilised to detect as many viral peptides andphosphopeptides as possible (Supplementary dataset 5). Table 2 illustrates thenumbers of peptides found for each of the predicted ORFs. Notably, whilst most of theORFs detected were also confirmed in the recent report by Bojkova et al. 10, therewere some differences. Whilst we could not detect peptides from ORF9b as describedby Bojkova et al., peptides corresponding to the ORF9a protein were identified. Thisleaves only E, ORF7b and ORF10 to be detected by mass spectrometry. In addition,peptides unique to proteolytically processed components of the viral replicasepolyprotein pp1ab; namely nsp4, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp15 wereidentified indicating that these important processing steps occurred as predicted(Table 3).Initially no unique peptides corresponding to the novel deleted version of theSglycoprotein were detected by tandem mass spectrometry. However, a typical trypticdigest protocol would generate very large potentially undetectable peptides.Accordingly, samples were digested using chymotrypsin and the analysis repeatedrevealing a single peptide corresponding to the deleted version of the S-glycoprotein,but only when using a 5% false discovery threshold. However, this provided sufficientinformation to enable a targeted search. This identified nine Peptide Spectral Match\u2019s(PSMs) with high confidence (i.e. FDR 1%) that corroborated the expression of thedeleted spike protein (Supplementary dataset 6).Transcriptomics and proteomics can be combined to provide unbiased insight into theproteome of viruses and higher eukaryotes 11,12,31. The ORF centric pipeline was usedto generate a list of possible ORFs which could be made by translating the first ORFpresent on every transcript sequenced. As before 14, to overcome the inherent errorprone nature of nanopore sequencing, the transcript was mapped to the viral genomeand used the mapping information to create pseudo-transcripts based on thesequence of the viral genome.Using this list of predicted proteins revealed a large number of novel peptides arisingwhich could not be explained by the standard list of predicted viral proteins. In themajority of cases they appeared to be transcripts with rare and unusual structureslikely resulting from rare rearrangements of the viral genome or potentially duringsubgenomic mRNA synthesis. However, in some cases a large number of similartranscripts were supported by direct peptide evidence that these rearrangements areindeed translated. In particular multiple versions of the N protein with distinct smallinternal deletions were detected for which 20 transcripts that could encode for theseproteins were also identified (Supplementary dataset 7). A schematic of such adeletion in the N protein is shown, indicating the peptide that was identified by tandemmass spectrometry to support the observed transcripts (Figure 2c).Allied to an analysis of viral peptides, the phosphorylation status of viral proteins wasinvestigated as this could reveal potential targets for licenced kinase inhibitors.Phosphopeptides corresponding to locations on the N, M, ORF 3a, nsp3, nsp9, nsp12and S-glycoprotein were detected (Table 4). The presence of phosphorylation sites onthe S glycoprotein has not been previously noted and may be of significance in termsof vaccines based on this protein, the location of these sites is illustrated (Figure 3).The location of the phosphorlaytion sites on the proteins listed is illustrated in Figure4 and additional models of the phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal RNA bindingdomain of the N protein are shown in Figure 5.This integrated analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and proteome revealedsignificant findings, in particular, the identification of an eight aa deletion in theSARSCoV-2 S glycoprotein that potentially effects protein cleavage, cell tropism andinfectivity. The coronavirus S glycoprotein is made as a larger precursor that must beprimed by cleavage using host cell proteases to enable subsequent viral entry. Fordifferent coronaviruses, cleavage can occur at one or more sites (termed the S1/S2and S2\u00b4 sites) depending on the amino acid consensus sequences present at eachsite and has major repercussions on host cell tropism and pathogenesis 19. TheSARSCoV S glycoprotein has a single arginine residue at the S1/S2 site (Figure 2b), thatfacilitates cleavage by a number of proteases including trypsin, cathepsin L andTMPRSS11D 32-34 and a consensus sequence for trypsin and/or elastin cleavage atthe S2\u00b4 site35,36. By comparison, SARS-CoV-2 has a four amino acid insertion(680SPRR683) in the S glycoprotein that results in the generation of a furin-like cleavagesite (682RRAR685) at the S1/S2 boundary that is not present in other lineage Bbetacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and the highly related bat coronavirusRaTG1323. Moreover, analysis of a cryo-EM structure of the S glycoprotein showedthat the SPRR insertion creates a disordered solvent exposed loop24 that protrudesfrom the trimer surface (Figure 3a). It has been proposed that this region is moreavailable to host cell proteases for processing24. The presence of a furin-like cleavagesite at the S1/S2 boundary results in cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteinbefore viral exit from the cell, whereas the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses such asSARS-CoV, lacking a S1/S2 furin cleavage site, exit the cells with the S glycoproteinlargely uncleaved, necessitating cleavage prior to or during cell entry20,37,38.The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein deletion identified in this study removes the furincleavage site, but also Arg685 (corresponding to SARS-CoV Arg667) required forcleavage of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. However the sequence 694AY/T696(numbering of undeleted S glycoprotein, cleavage shown by \u201c/\u201d; Figure 2b) is stillretained and has been identified as a second potential S1/S2 protease cleavage sitefor SARS-CoV downstream of the basic Arg667 residue23 suggesting that either thedeleted SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein could be cleaved at this site or only use the S2\u00b4site for cleavage. Recently pseudoviruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoproteinand the corresponding S glycoprotein with the furin cleavage site removed at theS1/S2 boundary (residues 680SPRR683removed) were made and their ability tomediate entry to Vero E6 and BHK-21 cells expressing hACE2 compared33. Deletionof the furin cleavage site enhanced the entry of the corresponding pseudovirus intoVero E6 cells but diminished entry into hACE2 BHK-21 cells. Although the engineereddeletion differed from the naturally occurring deletion described here, this observationsuggests that the naturally occurring deletion (in cell culture) enhances the ability ofthe virus to enter Vero cells and was selected for during passage in Vero cells. Thishas clear implications for the use of Vero cells to propagate and grow large batchesof the virus for research and especially virus batches grown for use in vaccinechallenge studies. Moreover, it also raises the possibility that even virus stocks whichhave been carefully assayed for homogeneity could still spontaneously generate thisdeletion during animal challenge studies \u2013 particularly in non-human primates andperhaps especially in animals from the Chlorocebus genus. Thus, vaccine studies willneed to carefully monitor the homogeneity of the challenge virus throughout the studyperiod. In principle viruses carrying the Bristol deletion in the S glycoprotein may wellbe attenuated in vivo in NHPs. The early emergence of a viral population carrying theBristol deletion within an individual challenge animal would give the false impressionthat an individual animal had a mild infection. Given that animal studies are requiredto use the smallest number of animals needed for statistical significance just one eventlike this could confound the study. Allied to this is the question of how such a deletionmay affect therapeutic assessment of monoclonal antibodies directed against thevirus. We have already instigated a programme to determine if this deletion alsooccurs in human clinical isolates and are currently examining the evolution of the Sglycoprotein deletant virus in human cell lines to determine whether the furin cleavagesite is essential for infection of human cells.In addition to the S glycoprotein deletion we were also able to find an additionalsignificant deletion, in high quality data recently deposited by Kim et al.8, in the regionof the E protein. This finding reinforces the potential of the virus to incur unexpectedspontaneous deletions in viral genes during passaging, that are hard to predict anddetect, something researchers need to be vigilant for. A recent analysis showed thatdeletion of ORF8 from human clinical isolates is possible 39 and our data shows thatnovel SARS-CoV-2 viruses containing deletions or even insertions can arise naturallyand successfully propagate. As the virus continues to spread and potentially comesunder selective pressure from the host response in humans, vaccines and antiviraldrugs in the future, vigilance will be required to detect novel rearrangements/deletions.Coronaviruses use a distinctive complex mechanism for genome replication thatneeds to be considered during bioinformatic analysis of their genomes relative toviruses causing other epidemics and pandemics where the principle driver of viralchangewouldbesinglenucleotidepolymorphismsand/orsmall (<3nt)insertions/deletions.Allied to this we observed a rarer but detectable set of deletions throughout the viralmRNA repertoire with several notable deletions that give rise to uniquely identifiablepeptides. This reinforces the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to naturally undergodeletions/rearrangements throughout thegenomeunder selectivepressure,something perhaps readily predictable from other coronaviruses but now confirmeddirectly in at least one cell line. If the plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 genome follows thesame pathway asHCoV-NL6340 then different isolateswill emerge throughrecombination and this may result in repeat infection as protection will not be effective.The detection of numerous phophorylation sites within critical viral proteins is anotherkey resource. The phosphorylation of the N protein of multiple coronaviruses is wellknown41-45 and the phosphorylation sites identified lie in either the N-terminal RNAbinding domain or interdomain linker46. Mapping of the phosphorylation sites on anxray structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal RNA binding domain showed they weresurface located (Figure 5). However, we believe this is the first report ofphosphorylation of the coronavirus proteins M, nsp3 and S. These are all membranebound proteins. M protein is critical in forming the viral particle, nsp3 is a keymultifunctional component of the replication/transcription machinery and S protein isthe major attachment protein respectively47. The phosphorylation sites identified onthe S glycoprotein may be important in assembly of the trimer. Residues T29, S31,S349, T791 and S816 are all surface located, whilst T240 sits underneath a disorderedloop which when phosphorylated, will add negative charge which may influence loopconformation. Residues Y789 and (perhaps to a lesser extent) T791 sit at the subunitinterface and may be involved in controlling trimer assembly. S637 and S640 lie in amodelled loop but are nevertheless potentially interesting. They are close together insequence and in the loops modelled for the compact folds these model well ashairpins. In the chain with the extended domain, the same loop models in an extendedform. This would be consistent with phosphorylation at S637 and S640 forcing thehairpin apart. These are worth exploring as potential control points for spikeconformational changes from compact to an extended form. Overall the identificationof protein phosphorylation sites is notable but we believe that the greater utility maybe that identifying numerous phophorylation sites on viral proteins will open thepotential for a rational investigation of clinically licenced kinase inhibitors as antiviraldrugs as has previously been observed for SARS-CoV 48.Finally, this transcriptomic and proteomic dataset is a rich resource for research teamsbuilding a picture of this novel virus as it enables an accurate overview of thetranscription profile and adds significant new direct observational data for the viralproteins.The authors would also like to thank Robin Gopal and Monika Patel from the NationalInfection Service at PHE Collingdale for isolation, propagation and advice on viralgrowth.

All work withinfectious SARS-CoV-2 strain England/2/2020 (VE6-T), isolated by Public HealthEngland (PHE), was done inside a class III microbiological safety cabinet in acontainment level 3 facility at the University of Bristol. A SARS-CoV-2 stock wasproduced by infecting Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 andincubating the cells for 72 hours. The culture supernatant was clarified bycentrifugation and stored in aliquots at -80\u00b0C. The titre of the stock was determined bypreparing 10-fold serial dilutions in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (MEM; Gibco\u2122,ThemoFisher) supplemented with 2% FBS. Aliquots of each dilution were added to 1\u00d7 104 Vero E6 cells in the same medium in each of 12 wells of a 96-well plate. Plateswere incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5-7 days and then examined for cytopathic effect. TheTCID50 was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench 49.Extraction and sequencing was done as previously described 14. Briefly, total RNAwas extracted using TRIzol\u2122 reagent (#15596026, Ambion) and the RNA extractedas per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations but with 3 x 70% ethanol washes. Afterresuspension in RNAse-free water the RNA was polyA enriched and sequencedimmediately using SQK-RNA002 kits and MIN106D R9 version flow cells (OxfordNanopore Technologies).To cope with the very wide range of transcripts, and to enable grouping of transcriptsinto classes, our previously described ORF centric data analysis pipeline was utilised14. The transcripts were mapped to the viral genome with minimap2 and the mappingdata was used to identify transcription regulatory sequences (TRS), the sites wherethe transcript meets the poly A tail at the end of the genome and junction sites whichthe software refers to as splice acceptor/donor sites as it was originally used todescribe spliced adenovirus transcripts. This script produces tables indicating whereon the genome and how often in the data each junction occurs. Subsequently, nearbyevents are grouped together for simplicity of analysis. Once this is complete, thesoftware then assigns each transcript to a \u201ctranscript group\u201d depending on its patternof TRS, junction sites and poly A locations and counts how many transcripts belong toeach transcript group. Nanopolish50 was used to determine the polyA length of eachsequenced transcript and subsequently the average polyA length was calculated foreach transcript group.A second in-house script determined which known features are present in eachtranscript group and generated pseudo transcripts based on the viral genomesequence to remove nanopore sequencing errors. The script examined eachpseudotranscript to determine what features it has, using a user-specified list of canonicalfeatures or ORFs on the viral genome (Supplementary Data 8). It also produced GFFfiles that allow the user to visualise the dominant transcript coding for each ORF aswell as GFF files describing the whole range of transcripts coding for any given ORF.In addition, an analysis counting the final number of transcripts belonging to eachtranslated feature was produced. The pipeline generated an ORF-centric view of theviral transcriptome \u2013 classifying transcripts according to the viral proteins coded for.To prepare intracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total cellular RNA containingSARS-CoV2 RNA was extracted from the Vero E6 cells used for viral stock production usingTRIzol\u2122Reagent (Invitrogen\u2122,ThemoFisher) following themanufacturer\u2019sinstructions. Viral RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants using a QIAampViral RNAMini Kit (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s instructions.Approximately 3 kb RT-PCR products covering the S gene deletion were amplifiedfrom the viral RNA using the gene specific primers F9newF and F9newR(5\u00b4TAAGGTTGGTGGTAATTATAATTACCTG-3\u00b4and5\u00b4AAAATAGTTGGCATCATAAAGTAATGGG-3\u00b4) and a SuperScript\u2122 IV One-StepRTPCR System (Invitrogen\u2122, ThemoFisher). A region spanning the deletion wassequencedusingprimersWu_24_LandWu_24_R(5\u00b4TTGAACTTCTACATGCACCAGC-3\u00b4 and 5\u00b4-CCAGAAGTGATTGTACCCGC-3\u00b4).Protein lysates were prepared from the Vero E6 cells used for viral stock production.The cells were harvested in 4X Laemmli buffer (BioRad) and heated to 95 \u00b0C for 15min. A 25 \u00b5l aliquot of the sample was separated using SDS-PAGE and the gel lanecut into 20 slices. The slices were reduced (10 mM DTT, 56 \u00b0C, 30 min), alkylated(100 mM iodoacetamide, room temperature, 20 min) and digested with trypsin (0.5 \u00b5gtrypsin per slice, 37 \u00b0C, overnight).This whole process was repeated withchymotryptic digestion (0.5 \u00b5g chymotrypsin per slice, 25 \u00b0C, overnight). The resultingtryptic and chymotryptic peptides were fractionated using an Ultimate 3000 nano-LCsystem in line with an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).In brief, the peptides from each gel slice in 1% (vol/vol) formic acid were injected ontoan Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column (Thermo Scientific). After washing with0.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid, peptides were resolved on a 250mm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm Acclaim PepMap C18 reverse phase analytical column (ThermoScientific) over a 150 min organic gradient, using 7 gradient segments (1-3% solventB over 1 min, 3-15% B over 58 min, 15-32%B over 58 min, 32-40%B over 5 min,4090%B over 1 min, held at 90%B for 6 min and then reduced to 1%B over 1 min) witha flow rate of 300 nl min\u22121. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B wasaqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid.Peptides were ionized bynanoelectrospray ionization at 2.2 kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internaldiameter of 30 \u03bcm (Thermo Scientific) and a capillary temperature of 250 \u00b0C.All spectra were acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometercontrolled by Xcalibur 4.1 software (Thermo Scientific) and operated indatadependent acquisition mode. FTMS1 spectra were collected at a resolution of 120000 over a scan range (m/z) of 375-1550 (for tryptic peptides) or 325-1500 (forchymotryptic peptides), with an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4E5 and a maxinjection time of 50ms. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to includecharge states 2-7), with monoisotopic peak determination set to peptide and using anintensity threshold of 1E3. Previously interrogated precursors were excluded using adynamic window (40s +/-10ppm). TheMS2 precursors were isolated with aquadrupole isolation window of 0.7m/z. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGCtarget of 2E4, max injection time of 35ms and HCD collision energy of 30 %.A targeted analysis was performed to confirm the identification of the del-spike peptide(QTQTIASQSIIA) identified by a single peptide spectral match (PSM) in the initialanalysis of chymotryptic peptides. However, there were changes to the acquisitionworkflow. Precursors were filtered according to charge state (to include charge state2) and previously interrogated precursors were excluded using a dynamic window (2s+/-10ppm). A targeted mass was specified with m/z 712.3759 and z=2.Six 30 \u00b5l aliquots of the sample were separated by SDS-PAGE until the dye front hadmoved approximately 1cm into the separating gel. Each gel lane was excised as asingle slice and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion as above but using 1.5 \u00b5g trypsinper slice. The resulting peptides were subjected to TiO2-based phosphopeptideenrichment according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Pierce). The flow-throughand washes from the TiO2-based enrichment were then subjected to FeNTA-basedphosphopeptide enrichment, again according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions(Pierce). The phospho-enriched samples were evaporated to dryness and thenresuspended in 1% formic acid prior to analysis by nano-LC MSMS using an OrbitrapFusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) as above.The raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software v2.1 (ThermoScientific) and searched against the UniProt Chlorocebus sabaeus database(downloaded March 2020; 19525 sequences), an in-house \u2018common contaminants\u2019database and a custom SARS-CoV-2 protein database using the SEQUEST HTalgorithm. Peptide precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS/MS tolerancewas set at 0.6 Da. Search criteria included oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da),acetylation of the protein N-terminus (+42.011 Da) and methionine loss plusacetylation of the protein N-terminus (-89.03 Da) as variable modifications andcarbamidomethylation of cysteine (+57.021Da) as a fixed modification. For thephospho-proteome analysis, phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine(+79.966 Da) was also included as a variable modification. Searches were performedwith full tryptic or chymotryptic digestion and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages wereallowed. The reverse database search option was enabled and all data was filteredto satisfy a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%.The fastq files and ThermoFisher .raw files are available on zenodo.org under thefollowing doi\u2019s: 10.5281/zenodo.3722580 for the fastq data, 10.5281/zenodo.3722604for the phosphoproteomics .RAW files, 10.5281/zenodo.3722590 for the totalproteome .RAW files (slices 1-10 of 20) and 10.5281/zenodo.3722596 for the totalproteome .RAW files (slices 11-20 of 20).171819202122232425262728293031323334Kirchdoerfer, R.

This feature was identifiedin over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furincleavage site from the S glycoprotein. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein canbe a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Alliedto this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteinspredicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique tothe deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Similar, to othercoronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 29.9 kB RNA genome contains two large ORFs,ORF1a and ORF1ab, predicted to be initially translated into the polyproteins, pp1a,and pp1ab that arises by ribosomal frameshifting (Figure 1A). Although the SARS-CoV-2 Sglycoprotein shares 97% identity with that of bat coronavirus RaTG1322, an importantdifference is the presence of a four amino acid insertion (681PRRA684) at the S1/S2cleavage site that introduces a potential furin-like cleavage site23,24. The furin cleavagesite is also not found in other \u201clineage B\u201d betacoronaviruses including SARS-CoV, buthas been detected in betacoronaviruses in other lineages, suggesting that this regionhas arisen during natural evolution25.Here we used a combined transcriptomics and proteomics approach to produce acorrelated transcriptome and proteome map of SARS-CoV-2 in the African Greenmonkey kidney cell line Vero E6. There was a closecorrelation between predicted viral transcriptome and proteome maps as well as noveltranscripts that encoded for proteins detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Complete characterisation of a novel and dangerous pathogen at a molecular level ishighly desirable. At the same time,independent confirmation that viral transcripts were expressed was achieved bytandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Finally, identification of phosphorylation sites provided an invaluable list of therapeutictargets based on kinase inhibitors. Thistechnique has recently been used to study herpes viruses, coronaviruses andadenovirus transcriptomes 14,26,27. However, only one transcript was detected and aspreviously suggested 8,9 the status of this as a genuine transcript needs careful furtherinvestigation. Finally, the data from the analysis pipeline was tabulated and describes thestructure of transcripts, how often they were observed, what features were present oneach transcript and where the dominant transcription start sites and junctions are(Supplementary Tables 1- 4).Manual inspection of the transcripts aligned to the virus genome revealed a largenumber of reads that aligned to the gene encoding the S glycoprotein with a 24 ntdeletion. This was predicted to result in a deletion of 9 aa, encompassing the proposedfurin-like cleavage site (Figure 2a) with the replacement of a single isoleucine residue. These amplified fragments were sequenced using the Sanger method. We have already instigated a programme to determine if this deletion alsooccurs in human clinical isolates and are currently examining the evolution of the Sglycoprotein deletant virus in human cell lines to determine whether the furin cleavagesite is essential for infection of human cells. This finding reinforces the potential of the virus to incur unexpectedspontaneous deletions in viral genes during passaging, that are hard to predict anddetect, something researchers need to be vigilant for. The phosphorylation sites identified onthe S glycoprotein may be important in assembly of the trimer. Residues Y789 and (perhaps to a lesser extent) T791 sit at the subunitinterface and may be involved in controlling trimer assembly. S637 and S640 lie in amodelled loop but are nevertheless potentially interesting. In the chain with the extended domain, the same loop models in an extendedform. This would be consistent with phosphorylation at S637 and S640 forcing thehairpin apart. D.A.M. and A.D.D. were supported by the BBSRC (grant BB/M02542X/1). The culture supernatant was clarified bycentrifugation and stored in aliquots at -80\u00b0C. Plateswere incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5-7 days and then examined for cytopathic effect. The transcripts were mapped to the viral genome with minimap2 and the mappingdata was used to identify transcription regulatory sequences (TRS), the sites wherethe transcript meets the poly A tail at the end of the genome and junction sites whichthe software refers to as splice acceptor/donor sites as it was originally used todescribe spliced adenovirus transcripts. Subsequently, nearbyevents are grouped together for simplicity of analysis. Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid and Solvent B wasaqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. ITMS2 spectra were collected with an AGCtarget of 2E4, max injection time of 35ms and HCD collision energy of 30 %.A targeted analysis was performed to confirm the identification of the del-spike peptide(QTQTIASQSIIA) identified by a single peptide spectral match (PSM) in the initialanalysis of chymotryptic peptides. The raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer software v2.1 (ThermoScientific) and searched against the UniProt Chlorocebus sabaeus database(downloaded March 2020; 19525 sequences), an in-house \u2018common contaminants\u2019database and a custom SARS-CoV-2 protein database using the SEQUEST HTalgorithm.
