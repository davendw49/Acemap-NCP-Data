Almost 3 billionpassenger-journeys are made as travellers reunite withdistant families [                Coronaviruses: what are they?Coronaviruses (CoV) belong to the subfamilyCoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales.There are four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus [                The Wuhan Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)On the 31st of December 2019, the World HealthOrganisation (WHO) was alerted by Chinese authorities of a seriesof pneumonia-like cases in the city of Wuhan, a city the sizeof London with about 11 million people. It was quicklyidentified that the first human infections likely originatedfrom Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan [        A timeline of key events up till the 23rd of January isrepresented in Fig. 2.Spike Protein (S) Envelope Protein (E)31st December 2019WHO alerted byChinese authori es ofa string of pneumoniacases in Wuhan9th January 20201st death fromthe 2019-nCoVoccurs in Wuhan13th January 20201st infec on occursoutside China, inThailand19th January 2020Sudden spike inrepor ng of another136 cases in Wuhan21st January 2020Taiwan and theUnited Statesreports their 1stinfec on23rd January 20201st infec on occurs inSingapore and VietnamAddi onal ci es in ChinaHuanggang, Ezhouquaran ned1st January 2020Huanan SeafoodMarket iden fied assource of pneumonia10th January 2020Gene sequencing dataof 2019-nCoVestablished andshared globally16th January 20201st infec onoccurs in Japan20th January 20201st infec on occursin South Korea22nd January 20201st infec on occurs inMacau and Hong KongWuhan placed inquaran neA possible threat in the ophthalmologyclinicWhile the 2019-nCoV transmission route is still unknown,countries have been preparing measures based on pastexperiences with coronaviruses namely SARS-CoV andMERS-CoV. These viruses transmit primarily throughdroplets and other bodily secretions. In the ophthalmologypractice, healthcare workers may be particularly susceptibleto these infections.        Firstly, ophthalmologists are extremely reliant on physicalexamination during patient consultation. Of particularconcern is the proximity between the patient andophthalmologist during the slit lamp microscope examination.It has been shown that droplets from a cough or sneezecan be propelled for up to 6 m [                Secondly, during the SARS-CoV epidemic, clinicalreports have suggested tears as a medium of infection. In acase series by Loon et al., it was shown that viral RNA ofthe SARS-CoV can be detected by reverse-transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the tears ofinfected individuals [                Revisiting the dangers of the coronavirus in the ophthalmology practiceBringing back strategies to preventtransmissionIn view of the potential threat in the ophthalmologypractice, it may be prudent to revisit the strategies thatsuccessfully curbed the transmission of SARS in 2003[        As the WHO Director-General, Tedros AdhanomGhebreyesus highlighted, \u201cMake no mistake: this is anemergency in China. But it has not yet become a global healthemergency. It may yet become one.\u201d It is currently verydifficult to predict the eventual impact of the 2019-nCoV.However, it will be prudent to utilise the lessons gainedfrom SARS-CoV and prepare for the worst.
